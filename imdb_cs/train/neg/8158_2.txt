How does it make sense to create a sequel that is absolutely meaningless to the original film? No point. That's why the continuing at Prom is so bad at night. The original film included a group of children who hid a dark secret that eventually got all the kills, bar one, in brutal vengeance. Can someone explain to me what a dead ball queen to develop from a grave to steel has the crown the first movie? Prom Night 2 had continuous holes that left the audience constantly thinking how it happened and why it should happen? But finally, I think you could call it one of those movies that are so bad that you're finally laughing.
