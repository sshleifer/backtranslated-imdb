This overrated, short-lived series (frantic two seasons) is probably experimental and unique as the truck driver who goes into the lane. I'm not entirely sure what they mean "nice" and "original" when all Lynch and his stupid TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it's original. Definitely. Next to "Law & Order" TP explains originality to the left and right. TP fans often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough to open up for the supposed "divinity", its alleged wild inventiveness, or anything else. it could be TP, it's just an observable, somewhat silly heritage that moves in circles, rotating horns in every corner, but (or because of it) ultimately does not lead anywhere.Exposed strangeness is always forced, characters behave in an extraordinary way as well, as they behave in the middle of the time in the way of IDIOTIC There is a difference ... Whenever I look at the "strange dream" sequence in "Life in the Face" in which the Dwarf criticizes director (Buscemi) that he is subject to a tiring old flight - - I think of Lynch Do you want a weird? "" Eraserhead "is weird - in fact, it's out of bounds, it's basically abstract. Watch the "Prisoner" You want to look strange? Films Felinina and Leone offer it. TP looks like an over-covered television crime, in which all young people look like fashion models. The image gives the TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies en masse. In fact, one TP producer said Lynch is looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fennova? Just like those effeminate faces of "hunks" directly from men's catalogs (or homosexual magazines)? Do not get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna seems to be 1000 times prettier), but then do not move when you say you're doing a "strange show with strangely looking people." And I never understood Lynch's misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal that I was bothering to pronounce his name correctly). He is not indestructible, but lacks charisma, seems to be a little too gentle and polished. Smichov's "eccentricity" of his character was not at all interesting, just one of many attempts by Lynch to enforce curiosity and to keep his reputation - he completely lost his border but this time. Everything Lynch shot was "Elephant Man" compared to his first two films. What followed was often an average effort that relied on Lynch's rather small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings in his badly linked stories that do not hold any water on closer examination. In other words, Lynch is the darling of all intellectuals. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer killed her dad ...? He was obsessed with a devil or some sort of nonsense. This is the best thing that the "great mind" could come up with ... You have B-movie horror films that end up more original. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "Television and Cinema: 150 Worst Cases of Nepotism".
