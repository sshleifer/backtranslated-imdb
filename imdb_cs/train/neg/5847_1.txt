I like high quality bullshit and this is one of the best. cg is out of this world, or at least prevents our world and madness of a sixteen-year-old boy in a rat suit that chases after people are ridiculously bad. I enjoyed it a little, but acting is so terribly horrible, and even the compulsory boring scene has nothing in it. just a complete waste of time if I ever saw one. I do not know who has more time left to watch this or the poor juices that have gone into the move to do it in a weak hope that it will start their acting career. I can assure you it will not be. However, for a clearer note I managed to successfully make 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this film, so I think it was almost worth watching for 91 minutes.
