I have two good things to say about this film: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk gives good performance (considering what he has to do in terms of dialogue and direction). However, he said, I found this film very tedious. Watching a dry color would be fun. It looked more than 97 minutes. Beginning with the start of the show, where everyone talks over and Paul Reiser repeats everything he was told on the phone, the film is unpleasant. The film is filled with clich√©s and helmets, not to mention the infinite incidents of audible fluence by Falk. The director seems to have difficulty in deciding whether he is going to be laughing or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but they all play with laughter. If you schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" appeal, you will love it. But if you were hoping something with more substance, look at another movie.
