This movie is bad. I just do not mean "bad" as in; "Scenario was Bad" or; "Playing in the scene was bad" ..... I think wrong, as if someone had to be criminally responsible for deepening this undamaged pile of feedstock to unsuspecting public. I will not even explain it dignified (Plot ???) if I can refer to it as it is. I can only think of other occasions in some 40-year film watching that I found the need to bleed my spleen on film. I mean, after all, no one's going to deliberately make a bad movie, is it? Okay, yes. Apparently they do ... and the guilty man is the writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters actually let it out to its customers! Be informed. Leave these bulls where they belong. He was stuck on the shelf and gathered dust.
