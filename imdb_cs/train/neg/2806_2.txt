The worst kind of movie. In fact, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen, and it has been a few days to deceive the security of the museum. Eh? <br /> <br /> A plasma screen that would theoretically run less than 2 seconds out of the clock battery, provided it had enough internal resistance to supply the desired current, which would not be. > <br /> It would be possible if a dozen large automobile batteries and inverters, but this system would fit into the case. I apologize for being anal, but it's not so close. The rest of the movie was not much better, and I wonder why the budget could not be donated to love or to me.
