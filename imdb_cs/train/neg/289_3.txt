What made the original killer tomatoes fun was that they were made by people without a budget who were just crazy for a few days ... <br /> <br /> It was something with a budget, but it was just not so much fun. John Astin of Adams Family Fame is actually trying to be comic here, but it is supported by lame actors, cheap special effects and unfunny gags. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy. Dr. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from the French prison and decides to stand on the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and Gizmo as "Fuzzy Tomato" decide to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Forgotten direct video nonsense ...
