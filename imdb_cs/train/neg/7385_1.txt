The movie is boring, characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is cheerful. This movie is a big mess. It almost seems like when the action music is composed, the most impressive stunt is running. Either the voice is nicknamed with Mr. McGregor or Steven too singing and changing his voice. There is too much dialogue in this film and extremely bad dealings on each one. The movie is great sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The effects of eye shape shift on girls with addictive drug criminals were decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through questioning, he would simply throw random drawings such as (spoiler) "CTX (his designer's drug) will be in water supply," which he never mentioned at the end of the film again. This movie is recommended to go through.
