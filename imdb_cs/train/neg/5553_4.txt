This third Darkman was definitely better than the other, but far worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy was changed and Durant was not brought back. In addition, there has actually been a touch of character development as far as the evil guy's family and Darkman himself are concerned. This caused my heart to soften, and I gave this movement as much as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
