Oh my god. oh god, I can not get through this movie. It was a terrible god. terrible, terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy them in a 99 cent basket. No, avoid at all costs, I warn you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life! <br /> <br /> First, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Get the real one that sounds like some new Barbie doll .. Super women? Are you kidding me. It was such a false false false false. People from the city do not really care that there was a flying blonde who was just approaching the city and saving the fire .. Oh, great! Jesus, was it me, or is this film offensive? I think what you need to be a super hero is a pair of double D, blond hair, without glasses and a leather suit with leather! If he tried to be romantic ... than God, I do not know. It was horrible if love means someone would come to an art show rather than sex in bed And in the air .. than they had complete love! It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First of all, that kid was the only one he dated the G-girl .. before they broke up than he, that Hannah girl ... and .. it just goes on. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie was thinking of me .. How the hell did they get in the theaters? <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at any price.
