I was disgusted with this film. No, it was not because of graphic sex scenes because it destroyed the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. She shows one piece of art she has done (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but she shows she is enrolled as a witness in the rape process when she did not name the first Judith during the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understand the movie, probably not, Tassi was no noble character. Artemis said. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false allegations of rape to prevent her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the transcripts of the rape, he continued to claim that he had never unwittingly knew Artemisia (aka sex), as she said again and again, "It's true." I encourage all these people to go out and find the real Artemisia and find out what it really is about. Do not put all your knowledge on this fictional film. I invite you to do some research, Artemisie really has an interesting story and a wonderful artistic work. You do not see the movie, but you will find the true story of Artemisia.
