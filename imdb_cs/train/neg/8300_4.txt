This is just a continuation of the title "The Christmas Story," originally called "The Summer Story". Ralphie tells about her family adventures in the summer when they moved to a small hick-city in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, does not happen. The original worked because of his unfair nature and sincerity - all of whom could relate to it. This is just stupid and not fun at all. The latest film by Charles Grodn - no wonder! It's one of his poorest roles. I apologize for him. Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is formal and you have to wonder why they even bothered. And I think, come on - the spinning peaks contest ?! It's sad that it's the best part of the movie ...
