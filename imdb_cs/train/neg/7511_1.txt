It was one of the saddest and badly controlled films I've seen a long time ago. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd try it: a bad mistake. The film should show how in the summer of 1977 the real life of the murderous son of Sam hit. what she really does is focus my attention on the most difficult characters that I doubt someone cares about their drug problems, marriages, and so on. The scenes that show the murders are just and nothing more; filming and then back to Saturday Night Fever! What's even smarter is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, believe me, you're not Hitchcock, do not stay out of the movies, it's even worse. The most silly scene had to be a dog that spoke in a noisy voice that was described in the scene before him where she was supposed to be shot ??? Spike, what did you think when you shot this movie? I do not think at all, I think. People who think they will see a crime drama will take my advice and do not waste time or money on this loser. You better watch Jerry Springer in this case! The waste of the film, I gave him 1 out of 10: terrible mud.
