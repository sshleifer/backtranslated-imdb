It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Some people left the theater, others were asleep (ok, it was a late night show) ... It's a senseless film, one of those who may never want you to see the mainstream again. I would like to look at the narrative of this film because I am deeply interested in what is happening to the authors of such waste. Are they laughing when they make all these ridiculous things, or do they think they're doing something interesting? I'm wondering ... The soundtrack is terrible, except for some of the tools that remind you of the previous Bjork album. Even if you are a fan of Bjork's music, stay at home. It's best to do. Small, tiny pieces of fine music are no reason to leave and commit this torture. God!...
