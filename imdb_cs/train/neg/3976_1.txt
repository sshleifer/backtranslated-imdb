Give it boring, the girls were sick and the assumed Italian men's leadership clearly did not hear the Italian accent. Some said boys were cute in this movie, but they seemed to be filled with average people. There were virtually no redeemed features on this movie. I think it's a cemetery for actors who will never work, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins, who apparently fascinates people for no obvious reason. I hope the Olsen twins find something behind the scenes to keep them away from entertainment. They have no place in it.
