I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it may be worse than both titles. Above all, I did not like animation, very Saturday morning cartoon, in some scenarios it was just worse. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella were average. Cruella was really pretty in the original, but she lost her quality while continuing. What she said was nothing at all to write about at home, and her animation was a bit ugly. Also her artistic companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have stopped smoking overnight. Voice talents were very good, though especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined it for me. There were some good moments, but the whole story seemed bloated and very suggestive for an expanded television episode. Overall, it is extremely disappointing to continue with the most memorable Disney movies of the 1960s along with the Jungle Book. I'm sorry, I can only give 3/10, it was not my cup of tea.
