I saw it two days before the official opening and I must say that I am very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems to the decision to cast Claire Danes into the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danish, it was either terribly bad, or so far overhead that it should be an early favorite of 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we should be sympathetic to her. Instead, it is completely different. Other "great" actresses do the work OK, but they certainly do not warm the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this movie, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture and is just near the end. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario. It goes more when it reads lines than actually "in character."
