you are talking about how you got rid of money .. I'm just wondering why Michael will play in such a turkey movie. Michael is a great actor, especially in a movie where he plays a man who is dying of cancer ... it was amazing. how the band for your son to see it as soon as it grows. Michael is such a talented actor ... so what made him do this? I saw it and I thought it was really stupid .. I think suddenly in their career they have dirty movies .. Especially "The Squeeze" I did not understand that one at all and I feel that his best performance was in the " Pacific Heights ", his character really slipped away ... and I really liked" Multiplicity ". . that one was so cheerful! and he was just Perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I liked "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny dangerously" too .. just bad some of them end up doing miserable movies .. like this was ...
