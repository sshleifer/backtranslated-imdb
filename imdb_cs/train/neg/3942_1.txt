Oh, God, what a terrible movie. The film has all the right people who unfortunately do not want to watch. I saw it for free in my local library. If I had to pay to watch, I would be even more upset. This movie is impractical. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow, uncompromising film. No wonder there was not too much distribution, everyone involved must be ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated video camera and my great tip. I really hated it boring. Tarintino lost me in my eyes. That must be a bad joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone even suggests you should watch it, kill them.
