Oh, my. How movies can make such beauties, but they are so terribly wrong. I mean, even Uwe Boll did not make a profit like that. There is no sign of a decent story, a multilayer character, or an attraction. It is just a random sequence of insignificant vibration that has joined together and created a "film". I suppose that only children under the age of 3 can look forward to the fact that the world is so absolutely dimensional and the story so incoherent that someone older would be angry. But again, it is terribly frightening for anyone younger than six, that there is probably no one who should watch this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take your advice and stay away, away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better story, and though she may not be able to draw such beautiful pictures, her stories are much better suited to listening. And please, in the name of whom you believe, do not expose your children to this piece ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10 and that's just for graphics, because the story and the evolution of the character are so bad they deserve a negative rating. And if you decide to follow this ... remember that I warned you.
