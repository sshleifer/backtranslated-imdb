"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - a hangout for social elite and party clubs. Ryan Phillippe in the film is the main character based on a real Studio employee from 1977 to 1982. The film's problem is that it's all gloss and style and no cloth. He's trying to be a really dirty, well-scanned satire like "Boogie Nights," but eventually he's seen as a low-income. Mike Myers is dedicated to playing a crazy role playing cowboy Steve Rubell. It's just a slightly comic role, and if it were Myers' best attempts to move on to the drama like Lemmon and other comedy actors did at the time, it's a complete failure. "54" could be striking and interesting, but instead it's just another stupid teen movie that's not fun or distant. Look at your own risk.
