Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see out there ... I've stayed with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted ... Yeah ... <br /> <br /> I used to I watched this show when I was in college ... it was breathless, a little fun and somewhat action. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were cute; no one has ever been killed or even wounded badly ... it was like a cartoon revived. Cut for 2005 ... What Happens? This does not work. As others have said, it's just not a cohesive story, and the performances are weird ... almost unpleasant - definitely not true to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a crazy TV skit and it takes over 100 minutes! It was one of the few that I EMBARRASSED watched the movie. What did they think? As best as I can say, I had to be for product marketing, toys, etc. I can only say let die die quickly. It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard look like a masterpiece ... I think the only remake left to do from TV is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
