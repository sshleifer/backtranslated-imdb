Bruce Lee was a great warrior, but this movie is probably one of the worst movies ever shot. It has Bruce Lee die as a result of a helicopter fall after being hit by some kind of ninja knife on the back of his neck but it does not explain how he came to be on a helicopter from the previous scene he has near but not on a helicopter that is already 200 feet away in the air. Since then, it has become totally absurd, like some cheap comics. Perhaps this thought is not so corrupt, but it is not done with any degree of art from the point of view of the film. There are dozens of martial arts bombers that are mostly made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has perfected the genre by adding credible stories and filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90 percent of the martial arts films that originated in the 1970s and 1980s in Hong Kong. "Game of Death II", in my opinion, falls into the category of unsolicited cinematography, even though Bruce Lee is in it.
