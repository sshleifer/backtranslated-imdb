In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Aircraft, Trains and Cars", a cheerful and sad comedy? the best thing he ever did. Ten years later, in this second sequel, which is not connected with other films but equally uninspiring and sadistic, again began to recycle "Home Alone". Four Scammers? that's true, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for the introduction of this revolutionary series change! ??? are exposed to electric radiation with metal chairs, machined dumbbells and blinded by color, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new baby is even less charming than Culkin. You think that the departure of almost all of the key players from the first two films will stop Hughes from shuffling the same old routines, but the only surprise is he did not even appear for "Home Alone 4".
