I can not understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap shit, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not look at it. Personally, I really did not like the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired directly from the street. The dialogs are quite flat and you always know what's coming. The overall quality of this film lacks the expected very low budget. When we saw this movie (I and three other people), we all meant that this movie was created by some people who needed it just to get a film school - with the slightest effort. Another problem that really exacerbates the whole experience is a bad camera (very shaken) and bad sound, it seems that the whole movie is recorded with a single microphone.
