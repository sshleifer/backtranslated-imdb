It had a great cast with big names such as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey, and a number of lesser-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with him in 1939. Now the bad news ....... Unfortunately, I can not say too positive for the story. He portrayed James the boy in a very positive light ... and Hollywood has done it since then. Why these criminals always point to "good guys" is outside of me. This film is enchanting and bringing its enemies - railroad people - into malicious people. The other one was so exaggerated that it was absurd. Well, this is the film world for you: Evil is good; It is well. <br /> <br /> Hello Hollywood: Here's the news flash - James's boys were criminals! Really - look at it!
