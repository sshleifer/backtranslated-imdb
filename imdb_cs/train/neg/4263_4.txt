Disappointing the movie. Actor's performance is weak. The kits are all right, it could be better. The story is also weak. Combat sequences are terrible. Sounds and film quality are scary. The history of Kazakh people has been told very badly. This film was to include more Kazakh actors in major roles. And he was also to be in the Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are hispanic origins. I do not get it. Since hispanics have been playing Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is a pity of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Czech director is justified because he is not nomadic, can not know the true spirit and history of nomads.
