The first lesson that some movie makers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - only "style" is not sold. I think Tashan, when translated, will be a style. Secondly, if you are hell bounded by selling style, it does not prevent you from having a good story. Tashan has a story that might be enough with a better director. But it's not slippery. For example, all three - Saif, Kareen and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. However, this setting is not used correctly. It could be a better mix and match of their narrative. The events are from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The chereography of the film is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar gave a good result, but this film does not belong. Why is the song sufi (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the nice song Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he's crazy English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he's in his stereotypical self. You will not lose this movie.
