This is at least the third remake of this movie, so when you watch it, there is a feeling already, do not be surprised. Everything they did was change the story setting and say it differently, but the differences are not significant. And it's not better because the plot is wrong to start. It never works. And just like her predecessors, acting is average. The plot has a unique end that will surprise anyone who has never seen a movie before, but the story failed. If this movie ended ten minutes ago, it would work and it was very satisfying, and I thought that was worth it. But here is the spoiler and that eventually the crime will pay because the criminal is not captured. I never like this message from the movie.
