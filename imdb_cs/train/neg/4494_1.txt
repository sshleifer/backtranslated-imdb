*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continuing ... <br /> <br /> From there, the whole movie collapses itself. First we'll encounter a fearless program with the hint of ghosts, vampires and werewolves, and so on. We get a man with a delayed accent talking about endless waste, two "spirits" that do not serve any real purpose and have no co-so-never nature and a lot of followers. Someone told me they were vampires (right from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not realize it. A sad man with an absurd name suffers the same problem as Oracle, far away and much worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, he does it, then goes on to do it and does it until he becomes tortuous and stupid. His last line before leaving is comparable to Storm's "you know what happens to the toad ..." in the X-Men at levels of utter clumsiness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic clich√© and Monica Bellucci because the wife is nothing but what we expect from the moment we see it. And then we get another kung fu fight! WHY? Neo is reportedly The One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and for what he uses it. Kung bloody fu all the time. And when he can stop 1000 rounds, he still shoots his sword and still makes food with 5 undetectable adverbs (vampires?). I wanted to see the forces of the exhaustive mind. I wanted to see him doing the wildest, insanely most madness of people, because he can do anything. I'm the same as before without "wow". <br /> <br /> Myth of persecution. That can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's just what we were about to be. All the great shots from this scene are in the trailer. Each. So, all of them maybe Wow was taken from us, so all we get now is a good chase sequence with guess what, kung fu fight! OK, it's not Neo, but he would think he would explain to his closest friends the reality of Matrix. At least he taught them something. It is not hard. "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what's going to happen to you in the matrix, it's not true until you realize that nothing is real, then nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so persecution is not bad. It's never boring and it does not seem like 16 minutes. It's so stunning. And yet it gets worse. The final climax of the film is probably the worst. They have this comprehensive plan, which includes three crews. They then show only sporadically between Morpheus's long, super procession, monologue. To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan requires 3 teams. You know basically, but you do not know who does what, when, when one crew goes down, you do not care and you do not know how it affects what's going on. <br /> <br /> I'll mend it, but it will happen that Trinity returns to the Matrix and sets the end. That's the only reason this will happen. Which raises the question why they originally had to send 6 people? Trinity gets alone in five minutes! <br /> <br /> The neo path to the Matrix center (so to speak) is treated equally lazily. Ooohhh !!! Running to the next 100 Agent Smiths !!! Woooooo !!! It had to think a lot. Only now are in the corridor, so the fight has no scale and ends in a moment. The man who is the big final !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect! <br /> <br /> Remember everything I said wrong about Oracle and the stranger? Add them together and double them, it's a really terrible architect. The only rational potential is that it is going to set the peak of the climax. <br /> <br /> Then throw it away! <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at Neo's options. Choose one door and die humanity (except 27 !!!). Choose another and humanity will die! Because of the choice is something that this movie is trying to discover, it's not really a hero. If he had the option of saving mankind and his lover dying or saving the missus and killing humanity, there is a potentate of inner suffering and tension. Also, when Trinity was in the middle of the fall, the potential of a real cliff that would make the third more important. But not. He did not save or saved the missus. <br /> <br /> Now the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then returning to life at the end. In the year when they came out, they were all so upset how silly the Jar Jar was that they did not notice that the end of The Matrix made him look like Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me to fall in love with One and I love you" .... Come !!!! How can the whole world omit how terrible it was? So what are Wachowski doing in the sequel? Well, it will make the end of the original look better. As? Well, by doing almost exactly the same thing (just replacing characters), it's much worse. I think my fa and r keys would be worn if I wrote long before I got into the worse. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is simply not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Badly so many ways. And worse, it's not a budget with insufficient budget. It's not a movie with too short a schedule. It's not a movie that was blown away. It's not a movie where it comes from outside too much influence. That's exactly the movie that Wachowski set out with Warner's property behind them. And that's what makes it so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say he does not have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie he ever did? Maybe not quite. The most disappointed and disruptive film ever made. <br /> <br /> No doubt. <br /> <br />
