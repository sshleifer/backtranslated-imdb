While it's not as bad as its adaptation from play to movies, this piece of raw material does not fit much better. Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does not do good movies. One of these days, he will be able to make money and stop the world from bombers. Acting was sub-par, the dialog sounded as if they were reading TelePrompTers, and Bolle's strange "touches" were seen in the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Just like all the Uwe Boll movies, it just should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> Just as Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
