This film, Hitchcock, resembles his later thrilling films and seems more like a very old-fashioned story of morality. The young couple will receive an inheritance they believe will make them happy. They spent money traveling around the world and lived very hedonistically. After some time, however, excitement begins to dwindle, and a few become unnecessary and unnecessary in their existence. However, whenever they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and loses everything - and eventually ends up much happier, because it is now worth life! What a strange, stupid and preposterous movie! Personally, I'd like to inherit all the money and find out if it makes it hard for me! Production values ​​are relatively low compared to later productions - a gross movie with poor sound quality and rather amateur acting.
