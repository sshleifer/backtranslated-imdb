When I was looking for this movie high and low, I actually found it when I least expected playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why I was infinitely searching for the little extravagant project that Chuck Barris has done during the past years of past TV shows, I have no idea. The film is just scary. The script that concerns the week that is. Of course, the top of the film are real artists who were "too hot for television" or a rejection for some reason or another. The part is still terrible, but camp badness that was pleasant in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for for so long, will I watch it again in my life? Clearly NO! Do a favor and just look at it much better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the real show. The girl acts where she was provocatively licking provocatively, it was fun, but I had to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon's flash that the audience was most likely made me sterile. Looking back, I was so happy that it was a massive flop because if it was a massive hit, it could be "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and my friends would definitely bring the Apocalypse. > <br /> My degree: D
