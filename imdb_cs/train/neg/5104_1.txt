What's wrong with the actors who participated in this show? Michael Dorn should hold Star Treck. John Diehl, is someone remembered in Miami Vice? He liked it there ... Well, anything - what can one expect from a movie with one of the baywatch rescuers headed? Nothing and that is what we have. None of the characters are even sympathetic, special effects are fun (but not fun). The story is (very bad) joke. There is no logic of what's going on. I felt the filmmakers were trying something like "Attack of Murder Tomatoes." Especially in the scene where all the important people discussed about national security in a wardrobe ... <br /> <br /> If you look at it on TV, switch channels - your TV will always be grateful.
