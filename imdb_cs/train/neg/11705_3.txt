This cluttered melodrama is perhaps the worst film that Ingrid Bergman has ever seen. Even its luminous presence on the screen can not save this unbearably slow and meandering film, which is almost impossible to sit without much of it. <br /> <br /> Only for the hard fans of Bergman; others are very likely to have fallen asleep. I recommend that you instead see "For whom it rings".
