Bindings, humiliation, S & M shows and nothing else. The plot is a flat, really just banal setting for stylishly spoiled sets. The star of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who was pampered as he ran around the stage in his dress, was almost as painfully disturbing as attempts at artwork. The dream of the ending end creaked. Aya Sugimoto, who thought the film was okay, was quite persuasive like tortured lead. Flower and snake were compared to Wide Shut, but in addition to some minor surface similarities, Kubrick's layered, artistic and atmospheric image is easier.
