I entered the theater, which he wanted to entertain for a pleasant 90 minutes of fun if he did not light up. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can not decide what it wants, and there is not much in the end. There are some humorous lines and some incredibly demanding movie links (The 400 Blows - for that character omit!). While none of the characters are of great interest, more than thirty homosexual men get the worst: all predatory, fat, sad, slobber. If you're in the mood for a film dealing with gay relationships, look for Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over The Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. Thank you. <br /> <br />
