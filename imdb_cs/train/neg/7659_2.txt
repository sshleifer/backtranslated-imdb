Alone In The Dark is one BAD film and tied to Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I wish that this was all I had to say, but of course IMDb determines word counting and all that. <br /> <br /> I am in two minds about what bad movie is the worst kind of bad movie. Low budgets like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget of shame like Gigli, Superbabies or this buddy. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid idiot who simply does not worry about his audience. It's more shocking when you realize that Uwe Boll has some real waste under his belt) created something that happens only once in the blue moon. A really terribly bad horror film. All this is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad fence, crazy random cameras and sharp soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible movie that nobody should watch. Woo hoo! Review. Give me a puck, in 2006, and I'd never say that. <br /> <br /> Do not look for this movie.
