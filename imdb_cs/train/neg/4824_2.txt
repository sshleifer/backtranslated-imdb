I wanted to like this movie, but many elements destroyed it. Using the full-length fish eye lens and torn editing did not make me feel like I was in the world of a moth head, but it made me think I was watching MTV for a few moments. The film never seemed to be anywhere, and acting was a great example of playing. I love movies that allow us to look into the underworld of the underworld, but this movie could not decide whether it is a bad horror film or even worse commentary on the horrors of addiction.
