But but but. Just like John Carpenter's season 1 ride in "Masters of Horror" was, it's the opposite. He surely proved he's still a horror master with "Cigarette Burns," but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've ever seen. It's stupid, totally free of spooky atmosphere and tension and overcomes it's welcome, even in less than an hour of running. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritated and uninteresting and the conclusion is absurd. And for those who actually bought a DVD (one of them is me); Did you see Carpenter describing the movie? He is proud of it and talks about it as his best work for a long time and praises the script. And on the commentator's track, where he notices the obvious break that came to the last cut, he just says he does not feel it necessary to remove the error and just let it be. I'm afraid the old man has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope I have shown myself wrong. I want to postpone the later remark and mention that the effects of creation are amazing. Technically speaking, this movie is top-notch, with effective lighting modes and complementary effects.
