A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. He was shot dead by two policemen and then out of the grave for some Satan ceremony, which was predestined by bad heresies. Hunting this woman continues with this zombie-demon. The sacrificed child returns from the tomb and wants the maniac dead again, but with the help of the police it will become ... <br /> <br /> Bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombie, baby doll, S & M , spoiled and twisted police officers, heretic worshipers seeking refuge before Jesus Christ, and three texts at the end of the film that explain to us what happened to the surviving policeman (yes, we should know!) ... Two decent cuts can not save the situation. I saw the worst horrors, but this was also bad. Recommended only for very hard fans of the genre.
