It would help to know why it took so long for a book like a "House next door" to adapt to film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons could be problems when designing a "house". The house in this life movie is really so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably come and destroy it once it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fool in horror genre books, but this was hard to postpone when I came over ten years ago. The main characters are not such people who are looking for something occult in life, and that's one of the strengths of the book. These are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon (or personified devil) without witnessing and analyzing the events described in the book so well. However, this is mostly imperfect book and I do not think she would appeal to people who run Lifetime. Maybe in the coming years someone will come up with another version of the book. Better house ... better music ... better screenplay and darker lighting ... sure to help.
