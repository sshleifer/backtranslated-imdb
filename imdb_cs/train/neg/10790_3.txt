First of all, I'm not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because the usual way to create boxing success is to hit the waist. This film is nothing but an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboo, as the director and marketing ads suggest. In my opinion, the only purpose of this movie is to make money by touching sensitive morals (in fact, it's usually considered taboo in your native country). Cheap populism could provide a brief definition of what I mean. <br /> <But the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most cast has a theatrical backdrop and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All the cast members were perfectly in their roles and well qualified for work, even the less experienced. (Like Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a little appreciation just because he knows how to pick a cast. Besides, he is just a media monkey who thinks he is a director with an artistic talent. But art is not something that rests solely on working with naked / half naked women. And just because the media can boast, no director will become a milestone in the history of Turkish cinemas. Just close your ears and something real artistic, waiting eagerly to applaud your next job. I hope this time you will be able to achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good acting, hot women (just fun!) :) Disadvantages> Everything except cast
