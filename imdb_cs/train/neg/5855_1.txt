The movie appeared at the beginning of 2000 along with MELA both catastrophes So sad that the millennium began with such nonsense The film looks like it suits 70 but looks like an unintentional comedy for the year 2000 Anyway some classic gems from the movie : Paresh Rawal I do not understand to laugh at your role or cry. Reason: She searches for her mother in the village where the worst part is when she realizes Anil's secret, keeps a secret in her stomach that becomes big and makes him look pregnant. I remember that in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! as a child I laughed at this, but this time here? The whole movie is a joke can not explain We have Anil in a double role (One older and younger) and Rekha plays an older woman and Raveen of the youth We also refuse Harish as Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani who are fighting for the one who has the worst wig. Direction is outdated Music is bad Anil tries to look too older in a younger role and too young in an older role yet is a good effort Rekha is adequate, Raveen is also fine Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is alright in a buddy
