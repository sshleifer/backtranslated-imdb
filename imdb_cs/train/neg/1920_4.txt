I'm not saying the Twisters night was terrible, but it was not far. Mediocre in the best condition. It seems to me that every time one type of film is released, the other must be at about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night Twisters is really just Twister except the worse and worldly special effects. I have nothing against the actors who played in it, even though they were not great, it was the film itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole story was just too weird to interpret. A series of tornadoes strikes the city and basically is a movie about people trying to find family and friends and deal with damage. I really do not know why duplicates of catastrophic films seem to be almost in sync, but this would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
