Usually I do not have a problem with unreasonable talents in movies, but that really upset me. Everything they did was swear. The whole film. (And as someone else commented, he got cancer) It was boring, tiny and demanding. I would not want to be you. <br /> <br /> It's also not that I do not like movies that, like most people who like them, will be entitled to "observing life." I like the Eat Drink Man Woman and all that happens is that the Taiwanese people's lives are leading their lives. But I can get in touch with them. I have never met someone who has sworn in this movie just like "actors" and I've been working on a construction site. So go get it. I said William H. Macy sneered me. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid if you do not like tedium.
