In the 1970s, WPIX ran the "Superman Adventure" every afternoon for several years. Every moment, we've had some experience of showing neighboring shows to broadcast "Superman and Mole Men". I've always been looking forward to those days. I watched it recently, I was surprised at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad due to special effects or their lack. It is true that George Reeves Superman's costume was pretty bad, the edge of the foam pad accustomed him to look more impressive and clearly visible. True, the Mole of the Lord's costumes were even worse. It is supposed that what should be skin should not have been a ten-year kidnapping, because zips, sleeves, and badly stiff fabrics poorly adapted to the baggy costumes were painfully obvious. But these were impermeable shortcomings. No, what caused it badly were fictional devices. Again and again, Superman did nothing to make the situation worse. Lynch crowd looking for creation? Rather than hurting a hysterical crowd or seeking the creature itself, it stands by and explains the danger of the situation for Lois and PR men. Are creatures corner? Again, they stand by watching and talking, but they will not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, a city smudge, shoots on him? Attempting to murder a reasonable person, but Superman releases men over and over again to cause further problems. Superman had plenty of opportunities to handle the problem, but he never used them. <br /> <br /> This means that both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in roles. If they only gave them a better script with which they could work.
