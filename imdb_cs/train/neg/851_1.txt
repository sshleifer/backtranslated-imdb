After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was going to happen. I had high demands on the film due to the evaluation. The only reason why I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars is that it tried to be a movie. I have a few key points why she did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> *********************************************** <br /> <br /> Casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence. I would NEVER choose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I showed Wendy very differently. I see why they chose Jack Nicholson, a smile, pointed eyebrows, but he should not look like "bad." It should look normal, and he turns into evil. They also make one of the worst movie pairs. Danny was all right, but he needed another life. He acted on the way to droney. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that I enjoyed in the book were either deleted, changed, or improperly processed. Some things that were in the book I was looking forward to (a hedgehog, a mallet, a lift) were not in the movie and it was two and a half hours! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. Finish. The whole end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze, Wendy never hurt ... Overlook did not blow. The end was so great in the book, and the movie was so overwhelming that I was drunk. Hallorann would never die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack would use a mallet. Throughout the movie, you've never seen a roller coaster. There are other things I did not like in the movie, but there are things that are fine. The stones of the angels were fine, the blood coming out of the elevator (not in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie was not with a book to be afraid at all. I recommend reading the book before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King that I really agree with the signing of the treaty so that Stanley Kubrik will no longer say. I would never do it, I would take all the rights that I could scream for him all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least it has a hedge. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
