In months I've heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute, as so many beginning directors are filming movies, combining the creative ideas of other people to create their own film prejudice. The troop, Swingblade, comes to mind some of the millions of parody Blair Witch. If all these directors want are feet inside Hollywood doors then they do the right thing and they should keep up because the combination of outlines is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase "It's an animal house meeting back into the future"; "It's Wall Street Meets with the Dead Poetry Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love Meets Star Wars"? I remember that independent movies meant original and courageous is not certain and predictable.
