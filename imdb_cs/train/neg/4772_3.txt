Before watching this movie, I could say that it was a complete copy of the Saw (complete with the poor place they were in, and a black boy who wanted someone to break his arm to get out of the cuff). MJH's name in the movie would usually turn me off (ugh, can we say GROSS ?!), but I still wanted to try it. <br /> <br /> I started to get a little interested. The game is terribly terrible and I found myself laughing at almost every reaction from the character (especially the one who played "Sulley"). MJH was still the worst, but I kept looking. However, the end was the biggest joke of them all! I thought this pile of bullshit was more fun than spoofing a "scary movie," and that's really something you say!
