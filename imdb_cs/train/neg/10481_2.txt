The film is badly cast except for some of the well-known old Hollywood names. Other performances by unknown names (like Jennifer Gabrielle) are unsuccessful. I have seen other films of this director, unfortunately it is one of his worst. Maybe it's a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> A positive note that the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the movie from being forgotten. But I used Pat in Karate Kid. There are many good movies and, in short, it is not one of them. Save money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
