I had such hope for this film because I loved the original too much. Disney seems to be trying to perfect the art of relentless sequel to DVD. It deserves a stir. Several, in fact. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was terrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in her movies. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and Hrbachek Notre Dame. They've done so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they sank to the end of the sequel that is not good enough to go to the theaters. I hope this film will not be an indication of what is going to happen to Walt Disney Corporation.
