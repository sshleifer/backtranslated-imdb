Perhaps I miss something because I read more positive things about a man who was cheating before I read bad reviews - and I just can not do it. I love my fuckin 'claw that they have a bit of style with characters that talk, look and behave like Humphrey Bogart in Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laure. None of the characters in this movie have this style or presence or whatever you want to call. Take the actor, Lee J. Cobb. Its crumpled, looking look looks so far from the lively, smoothly speaking Noir Archetype, as you can find. Or take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miskasting I've ever seen. She simply is not convincing in the role. As for the plot, it's tired and lacks any real surprise or something new for this genre. I could have predicted the outcome of a man who was cheating after five minutes. And the final scene of cats and mice is just old. Ten to fifteen minutes, when nothing happened, really destroyed any movement the movie could have.
