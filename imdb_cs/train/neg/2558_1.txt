I had to rethink it for websites, and I watched it with optimism that it might be at least beaten and yet fun and not even good enough. <br /> <br /> "666: A Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes that "The Omen" snatched away without shame. The end is even very similar to how "Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> And not to mention that acting, writing and the story are just hackneyed. If these movies make money, I find it sad to see where asylum is routed. It's awkward.
