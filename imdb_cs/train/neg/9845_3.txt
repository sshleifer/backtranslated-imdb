!!!! YOU MAY BELIEVE THE WINNER AS WELCOMING MORE WINE POLICE, AJ SIN I could not believe it was made in 1993 because it played as JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid 1980s. Does it start with murder, and it is left to the audience to have to "Guilty or innocent and going to sleep with her attorney?" But in the middle of the film she shows her beginnings of the 1990s by turning into "Lawyer gets manipulated and goes through client "that ends in an unrealistic way, and murder like SIN is even more ridiculous in this respect. This is a very awkward thriller, but the most unforgivable thing is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us all the time of the classic Judgment Room drama 12 ANGRY MALE
