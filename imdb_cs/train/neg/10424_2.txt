I should love this movie. the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie always felt very good. movie makes people working class look low and cheap. the fact that her daughter is ashamed of her mother, and that her daughter does not rise above the fact that she has always been a little disturbing to me. Barbara Stanwyck as a mother worships her daughter, but her daughter gave up mothers to find happiness with her to make a family of fathers. I wonder how many others who have seen this movie feel they like it that way. Although the acting was very good and worth watching. I really do not like the story line. only personal preferences
