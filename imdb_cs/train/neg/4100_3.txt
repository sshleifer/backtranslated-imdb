A little disappointing film, I would say that the acting was somewhat twisted. In many cases, I just could not feel that the facial expressions correspond to the spoken words or the intention of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should believe the audience is upset (or sad, happy, frustrated). It will not happen. <br /> <br /> The author's comment, which assumes that you already know the characters, was appropriate. They do things and say the things that come from nothing: the character Andrew accuses the parents of having signals to each other for dinner; then explodes and explodes and tells his father: "Do not touch me, you f ***!". Perhaps if we saw an ancestor, we would understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat at sea, and that's why! <br /> <br /> One special feature that Andrew does is to go to the old quarry and sit on the edge overlooking the "calm water" below; then she fits into her jeans pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights up. He did the same thing three times during the movie; Do I think we should see this as a tortured act of loneliness and anguish? Maybe once, but three times? It could have been four times, losing the number. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it is the fact that he recently discovered that he was accepted; this is happening very soon in the movie, so there is no sense of any dramatic change he could go through because of this discovery. It's not entirely clear if this is why it's so bitter or something else. I think there is some Lynchian feeling about the film, but should the director for the first time really try to change such mountains so soon in his career?
