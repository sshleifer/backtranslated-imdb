So I've heard from several people that this movie has brought them to tears in the theater. When I watched it for the first time, I was waiting for another romantic, jerky film Barbra Streisand; Something like we were. I was really sick. The chemistry between two main characters, Ester Hoffman and her John Howard, did not exist, making it impossible to join the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic addict who could not sing one note without wanting to hit me with a fast-forward button. At one point, her character found her husband in bed with another woman, and she forgives him five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about the star stellar star and about women who do not realize it until it actually dies. The parts of the film looked like they were moving on and on, and I asked myself when it was over. John Howard's death was completely predictable. It was quite obvious to predict his ruthless behavior in the movie, and when he died, I did not feel any emotions at all. It was not a tragic accident, it was basically an idiot. Not to mention the entire movie, that I was disturbed by his hideous beard. The only parts of this movie that are worth seeing are Streisand songs. The end of the movie, when she sings "One More to Look at You / Watch Right Now," was my reason for making this movie 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the film in which I actually felt emotions other than irritation and anger.
