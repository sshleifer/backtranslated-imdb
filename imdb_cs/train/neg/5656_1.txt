Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a terrible movie. It's just a superposition of scenes without a clear connection. It's also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But in this movie, something really amazing, we talk about sexuality, women's emancipation, the boredom of Arabic cinema, even today. I really congratulate the directors and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films but with better quality. The reasons that made me vote for this movie as horrible are not just scriptwriting and acting, but also lack of professionalism. This movie looks like amateur. We see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic film Ziab la ta'kol al lahm, it is not recommended. But if you want to support uncensored movies across the Arab world, watch and get your friends and family to do the same.
