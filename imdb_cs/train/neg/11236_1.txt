As a former inhabitant of Kalamazoo with love for the city, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the screenplay is terrible, the plot is unrealistic and the topic is disturbing. The main message of this film is that women are not without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in women's view. Writer lived under the rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not leave this movie to anyone. It's scary. It's embarrassment for the city that is named after.
