Since this film had a serious and fairly successful startup campaign, I would expect something to be fuzz ... from the initial scene (in which both brothers "sensually" caress, puts naked in bed) goes down quickly ... nothing that would get attention was not a conceivable thing in the whole conspiracy, baaad baad works (a few minor exceptions, but the art is at best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not interest any of them in depth (they think that perhaps the apologizing of the creators, saying they were focusing on fine film, would be fun, unless subtle and shallow mean the same thing ...). Exciting viewers will not have any interesting scene ... at this time that could save a movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things can be said ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I am myself and I would love if as many people as possible lost about 1Â½ hours of their life ... like me :(
