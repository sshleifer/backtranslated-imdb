It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me look at it. Well, nothing positive about this movie. For many years, there has been an idea that Madonna could act, but she can not. It has been a few years since Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's just a centerpiece. Contemplation all around. <br /> <br />
