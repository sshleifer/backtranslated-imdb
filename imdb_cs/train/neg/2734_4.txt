But let me face it ... from my few nostalgic sighs. <br /> <br /> The show is so great that it is allowed to have a couple of hiccups. I'm gaining a new season and just a little like I have to live two days. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it up, but it was a lot more episodes of the end of the season, which would explain the following: Dr.Cox is not to be bald for a few other episodes, just an explanation I think has changed the episode rotation or had to start the start again. And that my friends are the reason why hell cox is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is amazing ... bring the seventh season.
