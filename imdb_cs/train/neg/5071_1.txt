I can not even believe that this show lasted as long as it took. I think it's all part of cutting America. Personally, as David Spade said, I enjoyed this show better when she went according to her original title - "Seinfeld". What interests me most about this show, apart from the obvious basic sense of "humor" and general sadness, is the demanding way in which episodes are named. Truly great shows are still entertaining after many recurring views like "where Rob accidentally hypnotizes", "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "where Lucy and Ethel are working at a patisserie." In other words, it is an honor given to viewers for great programs. The fact that writers and producers of "Friends" would have no undisputed humor to actually label the episodes, by themselves, in a way that anyone could even see once again, would speak not only the average and the lack of original thinking by the writers but also the shaken minds of their audience . <br /> <br /> Read some of these people's comments and you can only conclude that they live in Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of greetings. The real meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake. These people should work in cafes and seek work as actors, but somehow they can live at $ 4,000 a month. apartments? Remember. Everything I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live an idyllic life in New York City with Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of them. New York does not exist for someone who does less than a serious six-figure income. But good luck with all of them. Now close the Soma window.
