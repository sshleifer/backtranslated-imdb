The directors who told me the version I saw was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours are too long. If you have a choice, definitely go to cut-out non-directors. The main story almost does not give up, the film consists of the main part of several murderous scenes that are linked, but the feeling is that they are only shown to fill the film with violence. The connection is not revealed until the second part and the lack of context bore me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie it does not work. You will never get the desired feeling from the character due to the average behavior and general disposition (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This strong side of the pictures lies in the splash.
