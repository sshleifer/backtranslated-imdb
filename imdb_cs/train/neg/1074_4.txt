I never had to start this movie and stop watching after 3/4. I missed a really bad end. This movie was disappointing because it could have been much better. She had a nice atmosphere, top cast and director, good location. But the story of baaaaaad, the bad screenplay. I paid attention to the southern accent Kenneth Branagha - it was better than the scenario. The conspiracy was stupid - driven by characters that were unrealistic and unlikely. Nobody is behaving like this outside of Hollywood scripts.
