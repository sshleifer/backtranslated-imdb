60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordan Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a feature-length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen by the eyes of the white family and the black family. The first half of the film is driven by Dutton's outstanding performance as reverend Willie Taylor and evenly extends the story among families. However, Dutton's character is slain in half, and the black family is completely forgotten in the dull, incoherent, and utterly terrible second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 to release video / DVD).
