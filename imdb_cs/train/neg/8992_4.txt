This is a decent effort, but the one who wrote the script looks a bit in the dark, exactly what makes the film zombie cool. No, these are not CGI bugs and software companies. Actually, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without captions, so I had to guess what she was talking about. Anyway, my opinion was - instead of having to waste time animating some stupid mistakes, why not do more zombies and other actions. 2/3 of 20 minutes form messages, bugs, some guys scream about something. And to make it worse (more boring), most of the deaths occurred outside the screen. I realize it's too common for budget-free movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, kindly) that let me think why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) decided to focus on how the epidemic began - it's it's short, no one will ever do that.
