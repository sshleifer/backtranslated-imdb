If this movie was a comedy, I'd give it 10. Oh, where do I start from? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this makes Troll 2 look like a freakin 'Saving Private Ryan. It's as if a group of pornographers chose to make a horror film, changed their minds in midproduction and decided to make a comedy, then went back to horror and then decided they would just get stuck with porn (softcore for it). Everything about this movie is just horrible: a musical score (someone shooting the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, directing, cinema, acting. There are simply no words to describe it. Oh, wait, yes yes: Holy * *%!
