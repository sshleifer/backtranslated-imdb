I was looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a while ... and everything about all reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say that the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene at that time. However, as the film exploded, I and my whole family were bored with boredom. The singing just came one after another. I mean seriously, another number of the musical work, and it would even break with the RENT. Moreover, I noticed I just did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of drug overdose, I knew I was going to be sad, but I could not feel any emotion for this character. The figures received fragile backgrounds about singing in childhood and what not, but there were not enough personalities that could bring me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not so significant, which is related to the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a Ray, Chicago and Rent based copy film (Ray and Chicago were, in my opinion, great movies). Overall, I think this movie will be best suited to someone who does not care about the whole story, yet he would enjoy two hours of entertaining and entertaining singing.
