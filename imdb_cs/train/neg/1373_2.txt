It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I usually praise some film for some aspect of its production, but the intensely irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film. <br /> <br /> The most common conclusion is that the guy who designed the building was inflicted and the avalanche collapsed. Er is, too. <br /> <br /> You also try to ski in a slalom avalanche style will not work. Running 10 meters in trees will not work. Unfortunately, he does it here. As mentioned earlier, the inborn stupidity and total stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In a confined space, with limited oxygen, that can tell you that the start of a fire is not a good idea. Still, he redeems about 5 minutes of films and receives some awards. However, if you have such intelligence, most of the film finds it hard to tolerate. <br /> <br /> It will hurt me that so many quality stories are not produced and yet someone will pay for it, made. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook, you have to watch to see the latest avalanche techniques. Absolutely invaluable.
