Or "Marlowe at sea". Another sensual overrated old movie with Bogey. Pretty talky, too. Bogey basically plays the same character as Marlowe; always under the control of the situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous the situation is, calling women "slender" and "ladies" and other such nonsense is the only "real man," the alpha dog in the film man is the head of the Gestapo - it's just a fat alpha male, and - of course - every attractive young woman who gets on his way can not resist his spell and wants his cock within a few hours of his first release. The character of the clich√© is here. Bogey should be the same kind of cynic-to-reform as in Casablanca, and naturally often refuses money or other valuables when he offers them - but how does it fit with the heavy cynic in him? It's not like he can not be a cynic; Hawks wanted it in both ways: a character who is both a "cold, lonely cynic," but also a good humanity. I do not think that ... Bacall for the first time has been giving birth to its "cool babe" for the first time and there are plenty of overvalued, not too interesting "Sexual Random" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues are stupid according to today's standards. "Just put your lips and whistle ...". Damage ... She was 19 when it was made, but she looks much older and is much less attractive than the star. Her bony face, with sharp features, is nowhere near that radiant to such a woman's beauty de Havilland, the cuteness of Myrna Loy, let alone the wearer Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suitable for playing vampires, not femme-facles. (In real life she is very similar to her face: Hollywood female.) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for its character. There are two or three bad music numbers - but my quick forward button was ready.
