The social commentary was exaggerated, and the secret itself was built and solved by a series of unlikely coincidences that were totally unbelievable. In Fitz's personal life, nothing has changed in the past decade, making it remarkably interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had difficulty understanding why he complained about his stay in Australia compared to the opportunity to solve the mysteries he has in England. Can he not be inspired by the Australian police? It seems to be a very artificial plot to involve him in the investigation of crime. The last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and unlikely, sometimes adjacent to stupidity, and he took the cloak rather than return to the focus of the series one. Sad.
