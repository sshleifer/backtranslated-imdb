Otto Preminger controls this light as a feather story. Czech Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widow David Niven in southern France with Mylène Demongeot nuts. Things are all right until she leaves the family girlfriend Deborah Kerr. Nivens, a degenerate lump, finds out that Kerr is too good to resist. It's okay with Sebergem if Niven loves her and leaves her (just like with all the women in the past ... including Demongeot). When it seems to be the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg has avenged Kerr exactly. Preminger tells the story in memories from Seberga's point of view and cleverly combines black and white with more colorful sunny scenes. Cinematography by Georges Périnal is stunning. The film contains some of Preminger's strongest directions, although it rarely allows some detailed shots, making it difficult to recognize what actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote a screenplay and is full of acidic dialogues and fun scenes (mostly a Demongetic bird). Seberg frees himself fairly well, but Niven is in his least appealing ... and does not show any chemistry with Seberge or Kerrou. Preminger has really gone wrong with this cast. It's a role that seems to be sewing to someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as the future suitor of Sebery and Martita Hunt as his mother. Juliette Greco, playing alone, singing the title song at the Paris Nightclub. Great titles are regular Saul Bassem Preminger.
