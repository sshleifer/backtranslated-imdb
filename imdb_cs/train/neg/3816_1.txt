He has a very bad acting. Bad stories. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it. Turn it off. Or you'll be raining for another 30 minutes. It should never be broadcast. Is not it great. You should never see her. NEVER NEVER NEVER. So now, if you ever wanted to watch this show, please do not. Turn to CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, These are much better family shows. So believe me I've been watching it before. and It's frank and I say the frankly the worst show I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of television. So do me a favor and never look at this show.
