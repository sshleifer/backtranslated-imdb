When I look at the film, I'm aware that it's just a "movie," but still allowed me to take as much as possible in the circumstances. I think that's what makes us scream, scream, laugh, or otherwise react emotionally as a listener, though deep, we know it's just a movie. What I do not want is a movie that reminds me that it's just a movie, so I can not go into the aforementioned involvement regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film decided that the screen often uses multi-frame camera shots at the same time. Maybe it's just me, but I find it terribly disturbing and totally irritating. They could also run a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen and read: "Watch: It's just a movie, do not let yourself be too interested or killed." If I want a "picture in the picture," I activate it from the TV's remote, but never during the movie I want to enjoy.
