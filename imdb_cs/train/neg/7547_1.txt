Waitress: Honey, here's the eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, will I get it? This is called an unnecessary precursor. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the way) Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really should not be so carefree with your things. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Who! Cracking? Basket: I think something will happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What? ? (Tear open letter.) Wow! My ex-girl's handwriting really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks a bit like a girl with a doll, which I happen to be responsible for sometimes killing. And she has her hairline. I wonder if I should get tortured and go find her? Let's see what my friends think of the district. <br /> <br /> Who is a male cop: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something will happen. <br /> <br /> (On the Island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Tree names: She is not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the pub) Basket: Can you rock it? Large walled tree pub wench: Huh? Basket: (breaks bees). Everything is alright. Sensationally pretty, a former promising actress playing a shameful grooming service: That's good. Honey is not a plant. (On the green side) Willow: Oh, yeah, and I forgot, you're my baby's father, Conan, er, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could stay and have a life with you. But I do not. I wanted instead to be a princess of a hive. I mean, I do not mind. (Nods away, dwarves awake, extending their eyes to anime proportions). Mwah, kiss. I love you! What have we been talking about? Basket: Who fired it? Who fired him? Who fired him? Who fired him? Who fired him? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Flash. Why. They are. You. He screams. In my? Is that because I raised Vicodin? Sniff. Cracking. What have we been talking about? Basket: I think something will happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: I have wounds. <br /> <br /> (In school) Rose: What is a man? Unappealing twins, in one: Phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Step by step. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm good twins. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something will happen. <br /> <br /> (for hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh bothers. A stupid old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> (At Queen Bee's headquarters) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Were not you a Cher student in my face in Moonstruck? (Licks lips.) Basket: I wanted to ask you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How do you ask. Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous. " Basket: Be careful to turn our semitrailer towards us! Aaaaah! Ah. Does not matter. Damn! (Pops another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back at the Tavern) A very sharp, excited wench pub: I've been trying out the bums, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and since last year I've grown even bigger. <br /> <br /> Tree name: HAHAHA. Better when you conjure up, my dear. <br /> <br /> Very Bone Wench: Completely. <br /> <br /> Basket: It was the last straw to break the trunk trunk back! Take it, wench! (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind) Sensual tavern wench: EEEE! Get out of it! Leave the island already and take me with you! Should I go with you or what? Get out of it, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take it, wench! (She boldly kicks her in her face, her eyes return to her head and become Xs cartoons.) Sad wench: Snore? (For Baking Nicolas Cage) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where the ring mobile phone rings in the middle of the scene of his bear suit and then the call drops. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I made the bullets I picked up from my shirt? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful about your things, Nick. Ha ha ha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> All: Drone has to die! Basket: (shouts) Oh, yeah, you bitch? Well, roasting will not help me with your damn honey! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (honey, get it?) He laid it down and came out of the trunk. Valentine! Smokey Bear says he does not play matches. Ha ha ha. What ??? Look at that nasty trailer! Ahh! Ah. Bloody, these memories of my phases of experimenting with drugs in the 1970s grew old! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad will happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close up. Damn! (Six months later) A sad girl in a modern sad apparel: I said the suitcase of the same name that took me with me. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drones: I like to help people. <br /> <br /> Striking wench: Then get me out of my contract to continue! I think something bad will happen. EEEEE!
