This movie is really fucking! I saw it as eleven years old and I even thought it was ridiculous! I would recommend this film to children under the age of 12. I really did not care, but I think he answers the very good questions kids need to know, such as: 1) buy money for luck? 2) Should I lie (parents) about things I do not think they would approve of? 3) Money buys friendship? 4) Are all the money? 5) Should I tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? These are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if parents discuss these issues with their children, they might also have to look at this video to show / scare their children that the lies have the potential to hurt you.
