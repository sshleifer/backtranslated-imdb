Bonjour Tristesse covers a similar role as a "wedding member". so that her daughter tries to prevent the relationship between a beloved family member and an interloper. While critics love a "wedding member", I find that Julie Harris is a jumping and adenoid scenery that is in everything she has emerged. This is an irritating, rich idiot like last year in Mariánské Lázně, this time it is a travelogue. <br /> <br /> In this sequence, Preminger movies are evolving, but the characters are not. In the first 30 minutes, he is happy with the blurring of the father-daughter relationship between Seberge and Niven, which allows uncomfortable sexual reading. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not provide the depth required by the component. Kerr moves to rank and turns the film into "infinite love." Seber's empty narration is something like something from Strange Interlude - that's not good. I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing the orthodox British behavior in all of his films, never getting to character. In the most memorable sequence, evening dance becomes free for everyone in the harbor. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise: "The Conformist." Kerr is on board to drop his hands and portray another major pain (like Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven knows Mr. Allyson, tea and sympathy, etc.). Indeed Kerr was a terrible actress. I wish every movie with her could end up deadly car crashes, or even better, start with one. People who do not agree with ambiguity should avoid it.
