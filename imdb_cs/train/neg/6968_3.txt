An elderly man touches a flower in a woman's greenhouse that seems to be defective. It gets stuck or something bites. It quickly gets worse and spits out in the hospital with a large wrinkled white larva of some kind. A later attempt to resuscitate it with paddles leads to spilling blood. The policeman is in the hospital because his partner was badly wounded at the shot. Somehow a policeman will get to mate with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought in. Several young children roam around the hospital, which I suppose we should find adorable, but who are extremely unpleasant brats. They happen to commute to the room where the sample is stored, and luckily, the growth hormone rises. Horror logic would say they deserve to die, but they are never in no danger. Critter grows and starts to behave. People run out of it and sometimes to him for some reason. Hospitals are surrounded by soldiers who are ready to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most people seem to be looking for a monster. It was quite boring. Obviously, something owes Aliens' movies, with the monster being born within a person and having several phases of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the main actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
