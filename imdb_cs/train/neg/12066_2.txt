As it is the original - it means that the rich old geezer leaves his estate to his grown-up children, to all the ungrateful losers and to the two scary servants, assuming they spent a week in their haunted old house. What happens to be surprised only by those who have not seen a movie or TV show before. After a series of murders in which the victims look like ketchup bleeding in the restaurant, we have a painfully obvious curvature. Casting is led by several formerly acclaimed actors had to be desperate for their payouts. There are also several actors from the second grade that grew at that time, but now they have long forgotten. The result is that the film creates all the drama and secrets of the episode "Matlock". I'll give credit where it's paid - the final scene is smart and fun if you're still awake.
