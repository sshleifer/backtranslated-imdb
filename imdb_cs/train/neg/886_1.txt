A couple of years ago, the men who created Paris, J'TAIME. That was imperfect but very nice (my rating was 7), created this piece of garbage for New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. In this current film I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel like I was in the city of my birth. New York has 5 neighborhoods, I have not seen any scenes in Bronx or Queens, there is one scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / no scenes from beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a great cast, most artists were not stereotypes, they were cartoons of the smallest kind. Very few humorous moments are all a matter of sexual nature or quite offensive to many who are all well known and loving. Several films nominated for the "Razzie" award were much better. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I think the title should be NEW YORK, I hate you .
