This movie is so bad that I can not believe it was really shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7 are you crazy? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh ** I should say. In this movie everything is bad. The story (is there a story?) It is nowhere, totally discontinuous, acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), musical score (what it is ****), editing and especially artistic direction, pure catastrophe. It reminds me of the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of amateur production, it's a marine cosmetics sleeping bag with a buckle on it. It does not matter, that's exactly what it is. Another example of huge mistakes can be found here: on the scene, you can see another, fat woman about Â£ 200 talking about her cell phone. The next picture, which is in a completely different place, you can see the same woman who is still talking about her cell phone (!) Yes, it goes far. <br /> <br /> Big, huge waste of money. Unnecessary.
