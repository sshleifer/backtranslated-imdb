JESSICA: The story of the story is as the name suggests the story of spirits. The theme is to be horror, but close to comedy! A woman who is brutally murdered will return from the dead. This is what this movie is trying to take as a plot. Nothing really is about it. The film consists of a series of loosely coupled scenes involving a man who had a relationship with this woman before this woman. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the introductory scenes, this movie has the appearance of a "direct" -DVD. "Unlike precious stones such as VACANCY 2, the film does not have a sense of direction or creativity and definitely gives the movie" straight-to- DVD "bad name!" Direction is just as bad as it can be with a total lack of tension, fear or tension, even dramatic elements are hopelessly processed and pose something boring than even the worst soap opera that you could have the unhappiness of endurance. the circuit is totally opaque and none of them are able to participate, they show even the smallest potential of a successful acting career, and many of the scenes are incredibly long and very long breaks between exchanges of dialogues I'm not exaggerating! , rather than 1, is that some of the poor acting combinations with an even worse interview for a couple of unintentional laughs In this sentence, I emphasize the word "little." This is not one of the "bad-to-good" films, like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, look at these movies. If you want to see the right horror film about spirits, look for the legend HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RING, EYE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. everyone who was lucky enough to avoid seeing JESSICA: STORY STORY to keep a good job! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not forget about it!
