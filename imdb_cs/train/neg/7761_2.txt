After a series of power outages at a remote island zoo, the genetically modified sabertooth tigers will be withdrawn from the island's leisure time. A human sci-fi channel has done some bad "original" movies, but I think it may be their worst! This badly written and directed "Jurassic Park", which is hidden, offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientists who think that the people who were killed by these monsters are "loss-making" characters, walking along dark dark corridors, the film has perish with a terrible death, etc.), and it is no surprise that there is no tension at all. The special effects are terrible - the puppet heads in the detail of the title beasties are bad enough, they look like stiff plush dolls, but CGI, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with dinosaurs" look like a life of comparison are just terribly terrible. There is a gore, but most of it looks quite unconvincing. Oh, and the death of scientist science at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen for years. I could not even laugh that it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, this is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting trivia for you? This movie borrowed the musical aliases from the 2003 "Alien Hunter" sci-fi film, which was far better than that piece of crap.
