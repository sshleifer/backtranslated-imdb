Now I did not say the original story to get to know all the literary points that were wrong here, so I'm not going here. <br /> <br /> But I've learned that Stephen King movies are just-not-horror movies, with a few exceptions. It was not one of them. It started well enough and I did not want to complain once, though Fred Gwynne was as usual amazing .. I would also forgive the complete lack of parental skills because it was necessary for the story to move forward ... <br /> <br /> But there was one emphatic point I could not help but got angry. And it came to an end of the movie, and at least two characters took part in the activities of stupidity. The moments I refer to are as follows: There is a small zombie around the house. You suspect he's under the bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> (b) lightly detach yourself from the bed so you can see the fully open end of the slightly increased security position or at least see the mini terror that comes to you, giving you some reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go. I feel like I have offered to defeat today. Bleh <br /> <br /> The fun movie is enough ... Just too scary.
