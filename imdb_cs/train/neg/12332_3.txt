The movie looks great on paper. The romantic comedy, in which the furious lover gets into the smuggling thriller, should be generic cross-gold, especially with this excellent rompical cast. I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope, and they go right and hang. Adam Brooks scenario may be to blame, but you should expect better from Kevin Kline from a fish called Wanda. Instead, two ping-pongs from each other and the unlikely growing romance never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason why someone is and runs around France. Jean Reno co-stars friendly as a cop-s-a-heart and I think he wishes to be a star with a party. Do not forget that you went into the remake of Pink Panther (s!), So maybe it was ok ... 3/10
