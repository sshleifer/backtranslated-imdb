I do not know what people have seen in this movie, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw this movie and I have a strong headache. except for a few good dialogues there is nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The big b rt is now a sermon to fall in love with a half-year-old girl. <br /> <br /> The film did not like it at all. I wanted to give 1 rating but I give 3 as <br /> <br /> I love the role of a young girl called AB by "sexy". my word "DONT WATCH" <br /> <br /> Save your own donot watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Save time and money.
