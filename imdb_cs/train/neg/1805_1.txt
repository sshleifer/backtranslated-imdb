This film is definitely the product of its time and seen in any other context, it is an incredibly stupid film. Heck, even seen in its proper context, is pretty bad! Mostly it is due to the stupid plot and very self-directed leadership of the famous Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni. In this case, he tried to combine a very artistic style with a hippie film that was based against the movement and managed to make a bomb with immense proportions. The film starts with a rap where a lot of "with her" students sit around and say such phrases as "power people" and complain about "men." Since most of these hippies have parents sending them to college, it seemed a little foolish that these privileged children complain so loudly and criticize the revolutionary jargon. Somewhat later, violence among students and "pigs" is being begun and a policeman will be killed. Our "hero", Mark, may or may not do, but is forced to run to avoid prosecution. Instead of heading to Mexico or Canada, he does what he would do only a complete moron - stealing a plane and flying into the desert of Mojave! There they meet with a random "cat and they sit around to philosophize for hours, then have sex in one of the fairytale sexual scenes in the history of the cinema." As they dress in the dust, suddenly other couples appear from anywhere, and there is a huge orgy of the scene While you see a little skin (guaranteeing the R-rating), it's not as explicit as it might be, it actually takes so long and looks choreographically that it only upset the mind And, of course, when done, many other couples </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < will enter the semi-Catholic state and the film ends by seemingly introducing the destruction of their own fascist pig parents and all the evil they have (such as hard work and responsibility). Instead of one simple explosion you can see that the same huge house explodes about eight times. Then unexplainedly you can see that TVs, refrigerators and other things explode in a slow motion. While stupid, it's rather cool to watch - like David Letterman blowing things or breaking things on his show. In addition to the conspiracy plot, the film suffers from a strong need for a simple character, as well as extensive editing. At least 15 minutes can be easily removed to make things a bit faster - especially because there is not really much conspiracy or dialogue. The most important thing is that this is an incredibly stupid movie and I was not surprised to see it in "The Thirty Thirty Worst Films" by Harry Medvede. It is a deserving addition to this pantheon crap. Such a famous director, who spends so much money on making such a cracked film, is a crime! Two final remarks. If you like laughing in silly hippie movies, try also to follow the BILLY JACK exam. Also in the case of art imitating life, Mark Frechette led his character in real life. He died at the age of 27 in prison several years after participating in the "Revolution", in which he and some friends robbed the bank and killed an innocent man. Dang hippies !!
