This edition is issued in the UK, which is rather less extravagant than the American version. The person in question gets a new kitchen, or a bedroom and bathroom, and is incredibly grateful for what he has. The American version of this show is all that should not be TV reality. Instead of making a few improvements to a house that the residents could not afford to do alone, the whole house would be rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a wretched social security system exists in the US, or if you're going to ask hard enough, you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement, especially from Sears, is also unsolicited. Rosther than turning one family into a deprived area of ​​potential millionaires would be much better to help the community as a whole, where to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on one house, build something for the whole community ... maybe a place where you can borrow and return diy and power tools along with building materials so everyone can benefit if they want it. Providing everything to one person can cause great dislike among other locals who still live in the same house.
