Hood living dead is a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma, where drugs and prostitutes fill the streets. One night, Rick's brother is shot dead by a gang who was driving down the street and struggling with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientific partner to bring the latest formula they work on and brings sick blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on humans or on the dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is taken just to return to life and celebrate on the human body. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother in front of his entire hood is transformed into the neighborhood of the dead. Hood of living dead is one piece of waste. This plot is a direct reflection of Resident Evil, acting is just terrible, especially with Rick's fake cry for his brother, the weapons are so fake, because every time a gun is burned, it sparks out and makeup is just lame. Only fake blood is on the actors' faces. Zombies are also modified. He runs, grows up and has to be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should just mix, run down and be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so awful, the outputs are the only real good moments of this movie. Hood from the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, a little fun out there, but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest.
