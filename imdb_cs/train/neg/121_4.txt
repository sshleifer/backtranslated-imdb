The one who wrote the screenplay of this film apparently never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have never seen so many bugs in biopic, from the early years of Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of material errors, but it would be a page. Overall, I'm convinced that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply can not be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be angry at how many mistakes made in this movie. The filmmakers have tried hard but the film seems terribly negligent.
