The worst Bob Hope comedy at all (and it involves some heavy competition). I hope you're lonely on the island with the sailors that you're in a bath with a geisha girl "controlling my ship." Someone has driven this hope-hacker over the cliff, because Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida can still work no laughter or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
