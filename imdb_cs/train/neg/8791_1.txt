Be warned! <br /> <br /> It is a shame that other bulls will not even have fun to be in society because it's under them! Okay, get it out of the way, let me say something more important. I have seen Ashe of Time a long time ago, when I thought it was a new material that is based on the highly-acclaimed wuxi of the novel due to the emerging reputation of Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite WKW's failure to adapt the novel to the screen according to many Wuxia fans; most of these are just drops of dripping water, sweat gulps, run of horses, etc. I could not sit most of the movie. Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's films the next shot after hearing a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was interested in his last, 2046. My friend told me to start with Chungking Express because they are his most accessible films. So bad! I was just p.o. that I was scared to waste time and money on this demanding nicotine. Some professional reviewers mentioned this as a contemplation of theft and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. Everything is fine if the director thinks he has something to say about why these things happened and told them. But no, it only shows what it is. Faye Wong's acting is very typical in the style of Hong Kong: garbage expression, deer in the broad eye of the look of the headlamps, trying to be a cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally impenetrable. I think the word Auteur is euphemism for a director who is trying something new and something to be applauded, but nobody who has ever mastered the art of cinematic stories, which is what Mr Wong has been for the last 17 years!
