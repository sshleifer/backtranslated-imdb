The American Humane Association, which is the source of a well-known disclaimer of "No Animals Damaged ..." (registered trademark of AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production for over 60 years after the horse was forced to jump to death from the top of the reef for the shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the horrific act will kill all the fun for me. I think it could be said that at least the horse did not die unnecessarily because it was the beginning of the public who woke up to the nasty and horrible pain caused by the animals for the glory of film making but I can not just feel that if a poor animal had a choice, it would not be the way he would take!
