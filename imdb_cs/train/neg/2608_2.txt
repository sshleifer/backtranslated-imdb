My ten-year-old daughter, Alexander, writes: I thought it was boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of "101 Dalmatian" things. I could not wait to finish the movie. The best part was the loans at the beginning - they were cute and well done. The rest of the movie is worth watching. Thank you.
