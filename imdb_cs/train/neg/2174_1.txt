It is hard to believe that people really like this blow! I think kids can enjoy it, but for me it's kind of a child's movie that parents can not bear. A predictable conspiracy, boring Belushi and perhaps even the worst actor from around the world. I give the headmaster responsibility for the baby, but she was really painful. I feel embarrassed because people know it's her. When I was singing a star on a star, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here to find out that they did it because they won Star Search. I have always felt that Jim Belushi is ashamed to trade with the name of his wonderful, unfortunately missed brother. Zero stars.
