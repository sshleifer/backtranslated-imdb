This film portrayed more racial hatred towards the Jews than David Mamete before I ever met in American film. Stereotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching has died. I was so disappointed at Joe Mantegno, who called for a lot of men, sat in the Jewish center in New York and cleaned the weapons, the throats that common sense prevailed, and I stopped. I am deeply concerned about the concept that Jews are not Americans and "others". I suggest that Mr Mamet is one of the causes of hatred and not the healer.
