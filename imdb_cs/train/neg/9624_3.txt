Given the potential of this step, reality was a disappointment. While it's always beautiful to see Jennifer Aniston in the movie, it could not even turn this around. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to slightly fun. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was cheerful in "There's Something on Mary". This is where the movements are going. If they have to pick up points from "Friends", they should know something is going on. Toilet humor should stay in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Watch instead '50 First Data'.
