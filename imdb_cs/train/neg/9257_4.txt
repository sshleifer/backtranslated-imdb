If you hope NEW NEW, you have chosen a bad movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of its predecessors can be good. Perhaps a producer and possibly a director, but hopefully they were not serious when they did this. This whole movie is like doing the biggest hits of DVDs from the first 3 films, but to change the actors. BHHAAAAD.
