If I happened to come across this script in text form, I read it and maybe laughed. I would not laugh at all the points in the movie where the director wanted me to laugh. Although I'm still not sure where they are. I do not care if it's Woody Allen, the writer can not write a dialogue, or at least can not consciously write a dialogue and draw performances from actors capable of laughing even with the best clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (Paraphrase) "I'm an art historian looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, that's what it says, but honestly, do you know about art history, who would say it? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Do you really think?" The whole script is littered with such an ugly quasi-intellectualism that I would not expect from such a recognized writer of letters. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's further work and I judge by not wanting to start learning. Those characters are, without exception, characterized as unintentional attempts to show that we all suffer from a human condition? Or really bad font? You will be a judge.
