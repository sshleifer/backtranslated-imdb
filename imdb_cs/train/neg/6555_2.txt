So at night I decided to watch Tales from Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder, as it is called in Holland. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was playing in her and I thought she had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately it was not. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two stories running at the same time. But they have nothing in common. Throughout the movie, I waited for the moment when these two story lines merged, so it was clear to me. But it is not yet. <br /> <br /> 2) The name of the movie says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well, that's it, sometimes. Just as the film said it covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a bad choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend to leave this movie where it belongs to a shelf in the on-the-spot shop that no one sees it. This way you do not lose 90 minutes of your life, just like me.
