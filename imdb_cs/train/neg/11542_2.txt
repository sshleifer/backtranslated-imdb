An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and severely attacked by a group of two-dimensional psychopaths during a night-time meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who were attacked planned and committed revenge on the invaders ... <br /> <br /> A remarkably repulsive piece of voyeuristic garbage somehow conceals as a "provocative" drama while in fact it comes as a sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would be cast if it was so easy to do in the seventies). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adama (Danny Dyer) is terrifying and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to shake the viewer's nose in every last ball of his sexual encounter. His camera keeps on Anderson's naked body both during the attack and after his attack, while the script leaves almost all the characters that accumulate in the turf sea of ​​a two-dimensional cliché. His script forced his characters to behave so that they alienated the viewer from the "victim" by gathering more terrible situations (Adams's attempt to attack Sophie and Alice), Alice's assault on Heffer after his suicide - confession attempt). The dilemma comes from the main protagonists - Dyer is a terrible actor, incapable of light and shadow as a young male victim of the initial assault (Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even if the horrific script forced her character to behave in corrupt and absurd ways, she in some way delivers an extremely convincing and complicated characteristic as a selfish, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs reprisal. A nasty and unnecessary film that was almost but not totally rescued by the impressive central female imagination.
