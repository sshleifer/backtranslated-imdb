This film won the award for the best animated short film in 1990. Over the past few weeks I have seen dozens of candidates and recipients of this award for the past 30 years, and I really think that this film can only be the worst of all - yet it was not just a candidate, but won !! I suppose 1989 had to be a terrible year for this genre. The film shows a group of characters who look a bit like the super-uncle Festers. It seems that they are simple articulated characters that move through the stop motion animation. They are all the same - with the same faces, bodies and clothing. The only difference is that each has a different number on their backs. Everyone stands on a large platform that is suspended, as if it were a spell, a universe. Each of them has a pole and is also a box on the platform. The platform begins to lean slightly, and the men react in response to an attempt to level the platform. This goes on and on and on. The only relief from this effort is when one of them ends up rather unpleasant, but it just is not enough to make it fun if it is carefully monitored. In addition to a short stop motion animation, this short offer does not offer anything interesting to me .... NEVER. <br /> <br /> By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why he was not among the candidates. It was very good and was much better than any of the nominees in that year or a year ago. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and so entertaining, it seems almost criminal that he has ignored him. Could Pixar not join? That seems unlikely.
