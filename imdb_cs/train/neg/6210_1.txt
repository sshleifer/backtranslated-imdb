This is the worst movie I've ever seen from "I know who killed me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that it's all about frustration and disappointment. Hey, Tim Burton, I was your big fan ... did you even shoot that movie? I mean seriously what f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving anything, it's a story in an unclear shell ... Nine wakes up, does things, its actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh, wait ... here comes the spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The spoiler warning! Warning: spoiler! At the end of the movie ... it's raining. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
