Scary .. Yes Scary !! Jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to the poor), Maslin Beach takes place on a nude beach in SA <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie two years ago - it's safe to say that it makes a bizarre theme discussion at school the following day. This movie was terrible! Hardly romantic comedy - just a show of nudity! This film came to its low point with one of the new-budget figures looking down at the girl's girls. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found the heavens. Get out of this, if you do not want to hear amateur actors, discuss issues such as farting, adultery, and the process of parental genitalisation together. AVOID!
