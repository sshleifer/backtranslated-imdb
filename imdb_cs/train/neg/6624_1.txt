This movie was absolutely ... ugh can not find the word oh wait ... crap! I mean, when it started, it was like, it looks good and then it was so dull. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I was caught late because it was totally dirty. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the cast could never live on the original Sholay's cast, I think what he was thinking of doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year, like he did to Black? Ajay and the other was good, especially the other who played the paradise because he looked at all of them. What Amitabh does? It destroys its own dignity by doing all the silly films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now I think he had to gather some of his money and move so far from Bollywood before losing all his respect and telling you he's already half his way. I think that's all really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who has a really good name right now because of the recent fall of Amitabha. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God, and I just knew Abhishek would be in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, look for Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie ever and it's the number one on the charts!
