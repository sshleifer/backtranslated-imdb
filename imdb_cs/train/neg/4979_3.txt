Why oh, why can not anyone make a decent film from legendary history? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf", which I was disappointed for the year. I have to say, however, that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" which plays Gerald Butler) was far superior. That was just a little disappointment. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What did most listen to me? Were they unnecessary conspiratorial elements that they added without any special reason (human sacrifices? Unnecessary interest in love?) Or bad CGI or inconsistency of characters or non-inspiring acting? Even worse was the way the beautiful Marina Sirtis looked so great !!! And do not even understand the fucking crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why they constantly remind us that Beowulf has the power of 30 men and yet never showed even the slightest signs of such power throughout the movie. He had thrown around the two monsters that fought, relying on his side to save his bacon. Even when he seized the arrogant prince, he did not jerk him. He was too reliant on weapons. Beo-wimp is similar. It certainly was not a powerful Beowulf from an epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end it positively, but I really can not think of one of them. All I can say is that if you've ever read "Beowulf", you'll be extremely disappointed with this dark, inaccurate excuse for adaptation!
