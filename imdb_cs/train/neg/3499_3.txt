The Comedy Central has been successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapel Show, the Mind of Mencia, the Daily Show and the immensely popular Colbert Report all star professional comics and all are, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were a solid show. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best comics in business, I expected when I found good things. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. Some were slightly funny sequences, but given that the star is a Silverman caliber, the show could be much better. It was only a pilot, and hopefully next week the show will be better. If it is not, do some help in the form of better writers.
