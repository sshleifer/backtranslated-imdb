SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 min Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell The 35-year-old bad girl Melissa is a new desert town and it's not until people around her they start to die. The detective has to put together traces with the help of his good-looking daughter Nancy Drew, played by 13th graduate Dana Kimmell. Local native Americans are the main suspects because they seem to upset the prejudices of the burghers. These events lead to the revelation of the murderer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> This under-slash is not very memorable. It's made for a TV show, without a big score next to a title proper own character who plays several times throughout. Lines like "the murderer will bring us to the hill." Insert the slasher into standard eighty scenarios. Marci calls Melissa a bad name, then somehow immediately develops friendship. Marci seems to see how hard she can fit because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would make it hard to squeeze today with the main character being fifteen and the director putting more unreasonable close up from it. The social commentary on India has not been so developed to be taken seriously. I'm too surprised by the relatively high rating of this movie. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's bloody birthday had the potential to use this tradition of birthday tradition to create an intense succession of massacre, but I feel I could not deliver it. But on the clear side of releasing dark movies like this on the DVD, it gives hope that others will follow.
