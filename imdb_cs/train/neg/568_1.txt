This "Debuted" on the SciFi Channel today, and the only thing I can say is "I'm not bad", which I shot today to see tonight. I had great hope. Now I'm going to tear the wardrobes and look for the length of the rope to hook. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie," but this film gives me nothing to work with. I know you do not have to post spoilers without warning, but I will also go "This movie is upset" I said it! They should show this film to film students to show them what they DO NOT EXPOSURE! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or soundtrack. ACH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool. I'm going to put it on my left hand and tighten her until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes see. I could just band over this VHS, but I think I burn it in the fireplace instead. I could have washed myself with soap, but I'm afraid I will never be clean again. Christmas coming. Buy this movie and give it to the people you hate. -Mike
