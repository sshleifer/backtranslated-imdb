Bela Lugosi is not in this fantastic twelve-part adventure series, starring as Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, and played the role of a White Magic force agent who was against Black who fought a young Egyptian princess and cut a slim and lively character in yachting equipment, complemented by a seaport. Somewhat clumsy plot deals with Chandler / Chandou in a continuing series of escapades aimed at saving his fiancee, Princess Nadia (Maria Alba) and others from the clips of Ubasti, who worships idols who long for Nadia blood to revive the ancient mummified princess on mysterious island of Lemuria. Ray Taylor, an old hand on such pastimes, keeps events moving in fast but repetitive scenes and shots, much of which last year's Skull Island setting from KING KONG, and the local harbor from SON OF KONG, reduces the original event to less than 60 minutes from the running length of the series for more than two and a half hours, and if seen in one place, it loses the effect for most viewers unless it's insomniac.
