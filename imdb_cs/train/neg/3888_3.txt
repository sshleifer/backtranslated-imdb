I started to melt to make the review as short and fine as possible. There's this astronaut, and he's on a space ship with two other people, you know? When something happens to radiation, and then when it comes back ... well, it does not matter what happened to other people, but our astronaut started to melt! No, not just burn, but MELT! As an ice cream cone in July! OK OK maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. Anyway, everything becomes red and gooeyem and the fact that he melts him is really crazy. I think he also looked at the manual of "melting man", because suddenly he knows that in order to avoid complete melting, he must eat the human body, so he begins to pull people apart. <br /> <br /> Other characters, but in a movie where you melt and melt and melt (and melt), do you really need others? What is important is that the WHO will accumulate more and what will be left to them? How long will it take for him to dissipate? Why was this film the first one? WHERE they got money? WHEN will you fall asleep when you look at it? <br /> <br /> I am very melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, even though this idea is really cool and kind of crude. Makeup is clean but everything else ... SPLAT
