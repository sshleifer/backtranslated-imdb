I've watched this movie several times, and I never thought it was not that funny, but it's still fun to watch and be good for a few laughs. It's about women working at the company and their boss. a bit and they eventually give him the taste of his own remedy and try to get the respect he deserves. Acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80 stars who plays a good villain, not really evil, just dissimilar. Dolly Partin is kind and fun to watch comedies. Jane Fonda is so-and-so does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this movie, she has the funniest lines and laughs several times, she has to love her. I could recommend it to anyone who likes the 80th comedy. I like the movie but it has what I do not like. It starts so well and has a nice flow, and then everything starts gathering together at once and makes me care less about the characters. Everybody has little fantasy about what the boss would like to do, and although "cute" I thought he was slowing the flow of the film. As the film continues, it rises again and the funniest things happen and then it slows down again, just to pack in a fast way that is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you have not seen them. I think it may be more or less pleasant depending on the mood.
