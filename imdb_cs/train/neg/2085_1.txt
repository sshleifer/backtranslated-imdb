This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have great strength to please himself or herself, I consider this film to be a childhood 14-year-old male fantasy. The bed scene was over the top and reduced the intimate moment to the far end of biological functions that resembled the gas passage in public. From the first to every other scene, there was a discussion about how little the sex is, how long it is from when they got one, when they would have another sexual intercourse and who they should be. In addition, dialogue and acting were very poor and very forced, did not feel, and filled their lack of content with sexual scenes. It could really be fun, because the concept is really interesting, but it's badly done. Please do not even think of anyone under the age of 16 if you have to go and see it.
