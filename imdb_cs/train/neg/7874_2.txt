Likewise, the passage of time is a success because the film achieves its goal: to be seen by thousands. But it does not make a laugh ... Les Visiteurs is successful because the subject was an original way to think about traveling in time: forgetting Zemeckis back to the future, comes old France, a middle-aged knight and an almost barbaric way of life. Fully proud, funny due to the old words he uses, Montmirail may sometimes be disgusting, but he retains the honor. Then comes the sequel. No one foresaw the huge success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's not a film expert who realizes that time corridors are made for money. The general story starts after the end of the Les Visiteurs project and immediately attempts to justify the continuation with a time paradox that would require some other work. Explanation: there is no attempt to return the jewelry that Jacquouille has stolen; do not you remember the nice red, glossy and expensive car you bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​jewelery ... And that's just one of the many holes Poiré is trying to avoid ... and he's failing. Let's look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's just a bit more boring. As for Frenegon ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier has decided not to compromise on this continuation in order not to lose her bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I felt so saddened I almost felt her pain. And Poiré does not realize that casting humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. Forget about time travel, digital effects, focus on the story and see that there is plenty of space on the postmark to write it 10 times. The main interest of this film is the landscape. Youth film, let's say 13 years old.
