Note for you all new film writers: Study this movie. If your dialog box reads as a dialog in this movie, rip your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I did not have a great deal of expectation, but he was interested in the description that suggested that the Christmas decoration was the secret of the Factory. The secret is solved very early and the film becomes romantic. I almost stopped watching it in 5 minutes, 10 minutes and the first break. My husband, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, walked away in the first break. <br /> <br /> The Forest River is a city of business - the main business is Aikens Ornaments, who make all the holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company recently died, so the future of companies may be in doubt. Soon we will meet Noelle, who is more on Wall Street than the main street, and the mysterious Justin, who with Noelle blows up with the big snowman who blows up to Justin's car. After meeting Alison Aikens and doing good care of the board, we have our story set. If you can not put all the story arches on the first commercial break, you have not seen enough of this kind of holiday movie. Maybe it's a good thing.
