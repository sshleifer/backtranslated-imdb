THE. WORST. FILM. AT ALL. MADE. After watching this allegedly homosexual film, I suspect that someone has brain-ridden half blind blind neonations and let him make the worst homosexual film at all, all in some fraudulent attempt to attack gay culture. I had to stop the movie and call my friend to come so I had somebody who feared when I stopped the film from shock, disbelief and outrage in such a stupid way. <br /> <br /> At the top of all horrible writing and playing and illogical and stupid plot, it's just a badly made movie. The dog with a tail-bound video camera could climb better. Seriously, after reading some of the positive reviews that this movie contains, I suspect that the writer must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film is even observable as something other than a joke is a liar or is heavily paid to say it.
