I think I've seen such things before: graduates of colleges do not realize they have a pretty damn good one, all the while they complain that their life sucks. This movie is highly derived from The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make of it: they have virtually the same plot. If something good was coming from this snoring-fest, it was music. That's it. <br /> <br /> As for me, I'm not overwhelmed ... but then again I never expected anything less. This movie was directed by the same person who shot Batman and Robin; another film that should be seen only with eyes in the corner. <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict: it's 1 of 10.
