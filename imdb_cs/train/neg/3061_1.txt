This movie is terrible. Give me a dentist at any time! You can believe that one of the main television stations in Arabia had it as their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expect the bagpipes with Dudley Moore to have fun rather than this. When I last looked at the bottle of hot water, he had more acting, better plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Do not forget whether you are drunk!
