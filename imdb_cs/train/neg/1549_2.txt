While Leon is cute to the SNL, it's just for a while. Like most SNL clips in movies, this can not complete 90 minutes. It has some cute moments (those you saw in a trailer), but the actors are largely forsaken. Tim Meadows does the best, but the plot simply does not have many high points. Will Farrell has a little role. Farrell may be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
