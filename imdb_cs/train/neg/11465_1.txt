Undoubtedly, it's one of the worst pictures I've ever paid for money - how you choose from desperation in a cinema at the store during Christmas holidays when you've missed the start-up times for no good but you're still set to watch the movie! And that's exactly how I came to see this stinking bomb ... At a distance of three decades I can still feel the rotten fish that make up this storyline. The incredible plot - that the killer whale blames against the individual, not the sea - is ridiculous. And that's all, except for a very extraordinary "love affair" that plays over the end of a movie deprived of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just chews the landscape. It was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not a "jaw". I did not mind most of it with great mercy, and when I got it on TV I immediately moved. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See current t.v. ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it ended in sixty seconds. This movie represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never come back.
