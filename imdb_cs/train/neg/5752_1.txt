I usually do not talk, but there are things to say. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Actor at Jeremy London was horrible! I did not think he might be so bad. The conspiracy could be good if it was well controlled, along with a good solid performance from the lead actor. Unfortunately, it's one of those movies you've read and you think it has great potential to be fun, but it's getting disappointed. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I laughed. If I were you, I would not waste time.
