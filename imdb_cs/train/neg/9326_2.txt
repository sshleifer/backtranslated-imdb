Me and a group of friends are making horrible videos they can laugh at, believe me it has led to some terribly spent money, but also to some great laughs. SICK. is one of the better horror but fun movies we've lent. The story is overcome, the whole will take your friends to the forest and never return the thing is very old. The most beautiful part of the movie looks like your visit to a local butcher shop, except a little dirtier and with blood on the dough that looks like meat. And if someone ever worried about this movie, whenever they should be holding Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. Good aspects of the film are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better than the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The second good thing is that this movie is so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like watching terrible acting or renting these terrible videos, I do not find the barrier, but I see the effort these people have put into it, and it is still so bad that it is cheerful and worth renting. laughing at one's downfalls, I would recommend it. If you rented / bought it to laugh at it, I would 8.5.
