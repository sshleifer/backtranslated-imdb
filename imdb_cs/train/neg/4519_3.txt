Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film on star Stooges and it's bad enough. This makes THREE STOGES GO all over the world in dage (from 1963) look like a masterpiece. The Stooges are the guards at a rocket spot. They climb into the rocket and go to Venus. They encounter some things, including the talking unicorn, who call "Uni", which brings them back to Earth. "Uni" speaks as an average, pleasant person - "Oh, hi, how are you? A beautiful planet here, I hope you like it." <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he did not say that the creators of the film will continue for a further 10 minutes at a party where nothing happens, the Stoogs leave the party, and then the film is almost over, the high point of the movie - the end of the Stoog's singing a sandy little song about their journey. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A * to * is really the top of the picture - music from old Columbia movies. <br /> <br /> The high sexy blonde was pretty. <br /> <br /> Amazing - a brand new video VHS from 99 cents only save.
