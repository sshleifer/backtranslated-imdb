Richard Dreyfus is not the star. She has about three 20-second portraits and what does Gene Barry do for the whole movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense at all. An awkward writer / director (the same bastard) has freed everyone from their terrible work. I got a DVD for a penny so I can not complain! But it's weird! And you make yourself feeling curious and not so good. This was the 1970s, and it looks like the director was on the wrong sour path and wanted everyone to experience what it was like in his head. It has a rather interesting and controversial concept, but as a scratched record it quickly heats up. It has the "Manson Family on Acid". I do not know how the other reviewers got everything they did from this film? Maybe they worked on when? In any case, be prepared to lose 80 + min of your life, never come back. Yes, it is terrible!
