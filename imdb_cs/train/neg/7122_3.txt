"Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and offer free funeral services if you should die. - Now it's a hook! The story itself has a rather interesting prerequisite for horrifying crawling: a horrified husband has married a rich woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with squeaking sounds, mysterious knocks, and skulls that appear at inappropriate times. Add to the formula a sufficiently scary gardener, who still remembers the first male woman he has been doing. Maybe it's just that the 1950s did not have technology that would remove some scary scenes needed to make this film juice. The techniques used here seem to be fanciful and secular. But again when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine-year-old, he gave me the heebie jeebies the same way I'm sure this movie did for young audiences of the same age. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Do not get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it seems it seems boring sometimes. But in Whitlock's huge but unbuilt house there is great atmospheric tension and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best scene, Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) plays in a pond maneuver trying to get a hidden skull, just in clothes and everyone in complete contrast to the mentally handicapped gardener (director Alex Nicol in the dual role). It will tell you who is the real dimwit. This is a good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie: What about this elegant Whitlock roadster is their first appearance in the - gull wing door in 1958! It made me at least jump out of my seat!
