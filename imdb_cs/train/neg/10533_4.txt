This version has moved a bit slower for my taste and I'm assuming I'm having trouble getting started with this game. But first, it's a typical television version of the game, meaning it does not have the will of the original movie version with William Holden. What can not afford to hire twelve people as extra? Why move the film until 1966? So could you give your little sister a line on Vietnamese protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line on the Civil Rights Movement? As for casting, some hits have some mistakes. Jay O. Sanders came across the right notes for his character, especially thanks to scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, lacks a lot of notes. He is believable as a former BMOC jockey, but has no raw sense of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla, so that all the women in the city would go to the curtain (forgive the game). Gretchen Moll was beautiful, but she seemed a little too wise for the character she'd played. He has not shown innocence or ignorance that character is required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about five years older than the characters should be. But Holden was too old for ten years. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgotten because Mother and Mary Steenburgen could not decide whether Blanche duBois or Katharine was playing from The Taming of the Shrew. As for Mr Inge's play, I have always felt that such stories of a young woman choosing a passion for practicality always needed an epilogue. "Twilight Zone" I believe we offer epilogue with the episode "Spur of the Moment," where young Diana Hyland haunted the bitter elder Diana Hyland because the young Diana Hyland chose a guy like Hal Carter.
