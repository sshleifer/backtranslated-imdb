"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" what does it mean ?! This story could not have been worse when a boy who feared everything became very courageous at the very end of the movie because he went to the library. The only purpose of this cellulose waste was to encourage American children to read when there could be a lot of ads in a cheaper and more efficient way of doing this! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (as predictable as being a "Page Master") could save this unnecessary film from a boring conspiracy. Even the votes of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart (even) Leonard Nimoy , or the Hollywood Voice of Voices, Frank Welker as cartoon characters will never save it. I can only describe it as the 1990s, which is equivalent to even the terrible adaptation of Babies water in 1978, because the faint animation worsens the movie without improving the tedious plot!
