Like the early horror movie The Boogens, the rude invisible killer is quite confused when he finally appears. Although Stephen Furst apparently played a role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror. The plot, extremely tired, has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) could not find the hotel for the evening, so they willingly agreed to stay at a seemingly good museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that nice IL 'Sydney is an unpleasant psycho, so we know what happens to beautiful ladies. Three women are very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (clone Helen Hunt) is the only one to go naked because Sydney watches her as she buys.
