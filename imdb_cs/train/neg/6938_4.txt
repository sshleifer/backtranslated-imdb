In this movie, old Amitabh Bachchan again falls in love with a much younger woman. She meets her in her restaurant. A younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. She does not know what to do and asks her. Her response to his invitation is somewhat strange. It's funny. That's what makes me whole. It was not so funny. Jokes and script were horrible! The only jokes I liked were the teeth of the waiter, but even after a few times it even started to get bored. Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. That was a special relationship! A little girl with an old woman's mind! It was scary! I know that someone can be connected to a child, but this man has adult interviews with this child. It does not make any sense. Tabu is the father of Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Parese can not do that. So even the conversation at the end, when sitting around the table, should even be fun. I just like movies that are really funny. I suppose he will never watch this movie.
