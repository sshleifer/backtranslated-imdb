I've never talked about IMDb, but I feel I have to watch the Batman animation. Its absolute waste! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell are they doing when they try to deal with the winning pattern? I feel like writing a complaint at the WB. The original animation was dark and thoughtful, just as it was to become Batman. WB had to do it with some rival Batman of the future. Now they produce this disgust. Joker is not remotely like Joker from a DC comedian. DC should sue. I urge all those who agree with me to send an e-mail or write a WB and use human power to get the original formula
