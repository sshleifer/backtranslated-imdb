Even the first 10 minutes of this movie was terrible. It's hard to believe that he could give it other than John Cusack. With a number of anti-war and anti-war films that have already been destroyed at the cash desk, it is almost unthinkable that any studio would want to connect with this script. <br /> <br /> At first it might look like a politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroy and Cusack (s) over and over again. Only about 90 seconds into the movie is obvious that this is an attempt at talent for DR STRGGEL. <br /> <br /> I like so many Cusacks that I thought I would risk seeing this DVD. I have to say that I do not know if Cusack is healthy enough to play another character to play again if no one else can guarantee it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the Iraq war that he is willing to commit suicide. Tom Cruise has never been so close that he's gone. Not even close.
