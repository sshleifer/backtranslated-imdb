Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with Hellman, is becoming a curious project that came out of the blatant Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, who won the role of Broadway and won Oscar for Best Actor, plays anti-Nazi German underground anti-fascist leaders, dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in states (across the Mexican border). They settled in Washington with a wealthy mother and brother of a wife, though the permanent guest in the house is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a lot of time at the German Embassy that plays poker. It seems to be the age when this drama finds its focus, and when we realize the heart of this material (wise, honest and direct refugees who teach helpless Americans in the sand as the world suddenly changes), it seems to be a bit patronizing - the viewer is literally inserted into a place of relatives, lectured. Lukáš has a few speeches in the third act, which undoubtedly won the Academy Award, but he seems to have much of the picture, but he enters and leaves, enters and leaves. Like his wife, Bette Davis talks like no one else and works in her broad eyes for good, but the role does not allow her much color. Their children (all with different accents!) Are alternately funny and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as a wife (and the dissatisfied texture it brings seems to be totally bad). The goal was tastefully, tactfully to show us precisely because the man (the era of World War II) may be German, which does not make him a sympathetic Nazi. We got it in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful film consists of exposure, defensive confrontation, and ultimately compassion. It should be a fiery mixture, but instead it is rather dry-eyed and inert. ** z ****
