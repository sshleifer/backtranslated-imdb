This film deals with two former football players, such as Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work as private eyes and meet different ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his former wife, Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who works on sex calls by phone. Jennifer is threatened by one caller who wants to do terrible things and ask for help with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or talk at the Sports Bar where everything is happening. There are a lot of blows, killing and a lot of double meaning of the word that will bring the entire movie to the big ZERO. Do not waste time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
