Why have filmmakers always opposed the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be tried because of the audience's interests, but look at Anna from Green Gables. They did a great job linking important events to a coherent whole that was simply gorgeous. I can not believe they decided to bring the three novels together for Anna of Avon into such a terrible mess. Look at everything they've done. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, wind poles. . . and years of Anna, for heaven! Would not it be nice if we met Priscilla and all other Redmond gangs? Kevin Sullivan was supposed to take things together, instead of all being buried and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good if you left the novels! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This movie was launched after he had looked at the successful journey brought to life by Anne Green Gables.
