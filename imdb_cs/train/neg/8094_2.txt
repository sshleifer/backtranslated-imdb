Like someone reading a novel or a film, I saw another reason why the movie was such a flop. First, any comparison between the novel and the film is purely superficial. There are two different animals. The novel is probably designed as satire, but comes as a cross between tragedy and polemics. Any comic elements such as those that later created the stylistic base of the film version are merely random for the author's evenly cynical force. And that the ever-ubiquitous white suit of the author did not know you thought it was Mark Twain, think again. A better literary precedent would be the ghost of Ambrose Bierce in the upper hat and tail. Tom Wolfe is an equivalent clown and hack, more personal than the author, always looking for a new miller for his self-service mills. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the excellent manufacturing skills and direction of the film have been condemned from the start. Unlike true satire, which is very well reflected in the film, controversy is not embedded in generally available observations of any form or other human behavior, but in a one-sided attack on concrete people - whether real or fictitious - who have somehow deserved anger writers. Any attempt to create a successful story or narrative from that beginning must have a clean start without the influence of a writer or interference. <br /> <br /> When I say so, I will also find a casting mistake. It's not just that incompetent players like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith can not count, but real talents such as Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are either totally useless or have role-play just cartoons. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is plenty of up-to-date material for truly great movie satire, but it can not get close to it.
