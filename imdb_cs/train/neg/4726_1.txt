Still another film about the tortured, self-inflicted, arrogant, intolerable, hateful, self-defeating head of attitude that we should care about. <br /> <br /> Do not Make Me Wrong I'm very open to all kinds of off-the-wall movies that have a strong self-destructive character as their main characteristics. What I'm thinking about is that this boy is so little. Why did the guy hate himself and the world? If the script was more concerned, he could get some sympathy. It's just gone like an unpleasant hateful nature, not tragic, hateful. After making a great effort to make this man mad and anti-social, and that his fate is as dark as the possible writer has the nerves to make a happy end .... It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's there that good fight! Man! Do not waste time.
