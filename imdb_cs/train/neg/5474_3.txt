To be fair, they did as much as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixs, but the dialogue was much sweeter than 9 pounds of emment, and CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some actors were not so perfectly cut out of granite, it would make the film a bit better. To say that it is terrible is to make this movie a bad service if you want to see something that I really feel is really good, (some big alcoholic beverages are a little deriguer.) Any way up, this movie I had I liked it and I had to look for it, if you have not seen it yet, just do not expect anything like "Jurassic Park, Lost World" or "Apocalypto".
