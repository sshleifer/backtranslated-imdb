I'm not one of those people who is just going online after seeing the movie and deciding to say it's the worst movie ever. If I doubt you, check out my other reviews. However, for the first time, I saw the movie so bad that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it ended. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is brilliant, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the worst horror films are good. There is nothing good I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially non-existent. If anyone reading my reviews loses money to see it, they can tell for themselves what it can be, but I advise that nickel would be worth more than watching this movie. They are wrong. The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> Two wires are attractive, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to destroy a movie for someone, but I INVITE someone to send me an email to foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before losing a dime on it. I'll tell you anything. I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventive films. I even like horror porn as a Hostel (which some reviewers claimed to have been, but of course they thought it only because Roger Bart was in it and Hostel 2). But it can be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and stupid EVER movie. And before you ignore this review, it comes from someone who not only sat down the whole premiere of the House of the Dead, but actually bought a copy of it.
