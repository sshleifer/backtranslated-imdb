(Very light spoilers, maybe.) Usually, with a Diane Keaton fan, I tried to watch today. I had to turn it off before the second hour, because I found myself totally uncompromising with my daughter or mother. Both appeared as self-friendly, with little regard for the other, with the daughter also adding a crude, disrespectful and ruthless mix. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least she will not have to watch her anymore." Keaton, with a good job, got into her stunned state and sadness, but it was too far for me. I just did not notice it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the hero, you need me to care for the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> The cast was sincere and well played - I felt them * and - and the best gay friend was wonderful, but even combined, it was not enough to bring me the film.
