"Valentine" is another horror movie that you add to a playlist and a slash (think about "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "Know what you did in the summer"). It's certainly not as good as the movies I mentioned, but it's better than most of the ripples that came out after the first movie, "Friday, 13th." One of these films was Canadian "My Bloody Valentine" from 1981, which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than that, but it does not say much. Story: The young boy is hurt at the beginning of the film and joked by several classmates. Then the film moves after a few years when all adults are adults, then they are eliminated one by one. A killer is considered a young boy who is now grown to seek vengeance. But is he? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigle. They do what they can, with the material they have, but the inadequate scripture really does not do justice to them. But there are some spooky moments. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
