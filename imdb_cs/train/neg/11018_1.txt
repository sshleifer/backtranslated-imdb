I bought this video quite cheaply ex-hire, I thought the cover looked pretty nice. And it was nice, but the film is waste. I can manage Class B, sometimes even enjoying a good B romp (ie, "Surf Nazis must die" is a classic example of how it can be a fun genre), but it was just a faint little one. Unbelievably boring scenes were too scattered by good healthy porno porn and horror horror. This film offers little.
