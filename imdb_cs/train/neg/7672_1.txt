Obviously, there have been a lot of talented backstage crew members working on this movie, so do not look at the credits at the end, you'll just keep them against them. No one seemed to be interested in this film, only three were in the theater; the two out for 10 minutes and they were happy. The "monsters" were the unemployed worm of Trek 2 stars, the Khan anger, and rejected designs for spatial creatures in Alien. The filmmakers apparently did not want to overshadow third-degree movie monsters, so they hired listeners who apparently did not remember or sometimes learned to say the words before shooting. Some scenes are incredibly awkward when they explain what to do if there is something. If you are so unhappy that you are in the theater where this film will appear and you are not going out, you will laugh at what should be the scary or exciting moments of the movie. The stunningness of several scenes will just stun you, and the regular conspiracy of Stephen Dorff from the "Queen Mary of Cursed Words" gives a feeling to everyone who pays. If you have to look at this movie, do a favor and wait until it's in the video store. If there is some righteousness in the film industry, there will be one of the main actors to lend to you.
