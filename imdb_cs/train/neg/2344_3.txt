For me, it just comes out like a soap opera. I think any display of immoral people can be considered a "social comment". But in the end I just do not like the way you characterize this movie. None of the characters are very sympathetic or engaging. Between Hudson and Bacall I did not feel chemistry. If there's a love story here, it's lost in sickness. And despite the fact that Dorothy Maguire turned to the witness stand, the story is not enough to keep me interested. No matter how many Freudian symbols and psychologies suits, this story is dirty, melodramatic and tricky. Rock Hudson is a noble wood. This is Lauren Bacall's least attuned role and one of the poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver an inspirational performance, but her character is shameful and pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving father of two distrustful adult children, is most compassionate. The most interesting of all, however, is Robert Wilke, who has a small role as the owner of the bar. He is best remembered as an unpleasant friend in countless Western countries, but here he is a sincere and sympathetic man. I will take my social commentary with an interesting, stunning story and some nice characters, thank you.
