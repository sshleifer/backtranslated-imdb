This is the worst document that comes from Canada at all !!!! I'm glad the guys did not make another movie. All they want to do is get a movie and it does not have to be the one they wrote. They continue to change the script to adapt to the person they place. I could not get out of the theater pretty fast when I saw her at this year's Toronto Film Festival. You never see this movie.
