This movie was made and occupied from my home town. I remember the upset and the whole hullabaloo about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in the city ... Action ... In fact, 20 years after the film was "laid to rest" without being completed, a group of film students went to she completed it - with terrible consequences. It seems that someone does not want the movie to be completed. The story is lean. You have to realize that it's a comedy, so you need to talk a little bit, but it has no real will. The characters are mostly transperant and little information you have about them, you do not care, they seem to be insignificant. It is strange that I heard Kylie's accent as an Australian again and nice to see the child I went to school with in the lead role. But the movie does not buy at all. He knows well why the creators thought they would get to Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the movie (it is a homage to the 80th films / bad horror films), but really the Aussie actor would do fine. As far as casting is concerned, it was a lot of constipation. Some of these children (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. This is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feeling about them. Perhaps it lit it? It's just not as smooth as it's used to. <br /> <br /> Killer. Mr. Can it be less frightening? But there are some shocking factors and a few rough scenes. I liked the movie but it was not great. It took 90 minutes, but it could have been less. Perhaps, if the script were quiet, it would be better. They had a lot of dead bodies - but none of them got better. Perhaps if they killed fewer people and really focused on a terrifying atmosphere, it would be better. Now I know it's comedy and the elements were fun. Or so incredibly funny. But I'm not convinced.
