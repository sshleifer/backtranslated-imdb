When young Kevin receives the ship of his dead uncle as a present, he invites five friends to visit Catalina Island for the weekend. During the journey, they drink booze, have sex and play games, each one telling their greatest fear. Later Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops and is scary and murdered by their greatest inner fear. Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes, the band stopped looking at this dirty and boring amateur piece of crap, and we decided to see another movie. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this movie to find out how bad it might be, and it would be better to go to bed sleeping. The confused story has horrible cinematography and camera work with an actor who is probably studying for actors and actresses, and eventually this film appears to be a bad project of a cinematographic school. The terrible and demanding script eventually shows a ridiculous intervention, in fact a complete mess that let me understand what the story is all about. Was the girl crazy and was traveling alone on the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If it is true, are their friends again at the very end of her madness? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Viagem Para and Morte" ("The Way to Death")
