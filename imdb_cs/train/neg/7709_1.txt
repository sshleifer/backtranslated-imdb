You never see this movie. He's trying to be a spoof on sci-fi / thriller movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but everything that's going on makes you really bad that you watched one of them and not that. <br /> <br /> It's very bleak. The perfume must have some aspect that has some superior quality. This film does not have that aspect. <br /> <br /> Save it. It's too late for me, but ... do not look at it.
