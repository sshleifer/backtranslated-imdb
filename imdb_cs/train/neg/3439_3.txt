***** probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say I liked it, but I can say that I ... was ... very special. It has bad things in it, like a shark that has gotten out of the blue, with the worst CGI you can imagine if I was a director, I'd definitely drop this part, I've had the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie. .. For some people it will be boring because it lacks action, it feels at home sometimes made ... Take a scene, for example, that one of the friends died and the other thing they do is what? nop, not crying ... telling their horror stories to each other .. * sighs * (just after crying for losing the password) Another stupid thing was when they spoke inside the ship they had as "hundreds" of candles in the table ... is surrounded by a curtain (old rags covering the windows) and the sofas / sofas ... I thought it was silly, using candles but not thinking around, besides being alone in the open sea ... <br /> < br /> well, some frightening scenes that are well made, I liked. Sometimes horror works better when it's hidden when it's behind something instead of showing up so this movie does it well, perhaps because its low budgets do not know but it works well for me! You will feel stress if you forget some holes, like those I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much! but if you like anykind from the movie watch this, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw English) =) <br /> <br />
