Looks like this movie! Striking acting, terrible script, terrible effects, terrible terrible horrors! Nothing here buys even for those who are the worst of horror fans! Crazy killer stops students at college. People are dead in the corridors, but the class continues as normal ??? After about a fourth body, I would think that it would allow students a break for a few days! LOL. It's as bad as people. This film should be portrayed as a means of torturing criminals. You were warned!
