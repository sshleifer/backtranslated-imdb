Do we really need more narcissistic garbage on the Baby Boomer generation? From a technical point of view, I am Boomer, even though at the time when all the "idealistic youth" of the 1960s read Marx, they fired their cards and generally prolonged the war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well and 9 out of ten were just crazy fools who would believe anything as destructive as it was. This is just another exercise in self-sufficiency from children who never really grow up.
