This movie was just obsessed with MST3K and with good reason. First of all because it's a "cop" movie starring Joe Don Baker, whom we all know, is about as good a policeman as Michael Jackson is a Western singer country. the equipment protects their ugly heads, battling in the bar, kidnapping hostages, bad acting, dirty police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / righteousness, infinite rushing and, of course, bad acting. Do not watch without the MST3K filter.
