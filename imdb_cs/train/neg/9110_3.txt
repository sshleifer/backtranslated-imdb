I was watching this movie at 3am, in the morning, the day when I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. Reasons why there is so much. The effects are not so good, and from time to time, the situations that occur to them reminded me of the faint Chevy Chase comedy of the 1990s. I mean, come along, as well as the situation in the loops and the poker situation between the servants ... This movie was so obviously very based on the first and that's fine. But if I did not see the first one than he would see, it would be even worse. Like the end, it came out very suddenly and I felt like I did not close what much ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this one seems to have been made exclusively for explanation of nr 1, and like no time or effort was used to do anything else good. The score is the same as the first one and it was not a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> They had to deal with the situation with more style and class, but they did not, and that's why the movie became bad ...
