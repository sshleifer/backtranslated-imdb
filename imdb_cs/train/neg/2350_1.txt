This show was ridiculously bad. The script sucked in, the dialogue sucked. The guy who played Craig could not come out of a paper bag. It was on Thursday night, it was definitely great to watch with some beers. Great music, bad acting, bad writing, everything has happened to my fun. It was a drama / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, it was boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, because they could not reveal who was a victim, had to write a dialogue around her, which was terrible. I understand that curiosity was ridiculous at the funeral. In fact, all the scenes that occurred in the present were absolutely terrible. So, let's see. Everything that is happening today is breathtaking. Scenes with memories, just writing, dialogue, and Craig's effect sucked in. But the music ruled.
