If the scale was negative, I would be happier. See Sushmitu Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director destroyed all and all the fun in this story. Choice of angles, choice of lighting, and everything that has got rid of the effort to remember what the story is. Oh, if those songs and dances did not make you break your ears first. The film could be produced twice in 1.25 hours and was quite good, like "The Seven Samurai," but the director and writer did not go this way, even though "urban people" finally find their backbone and want to help. This movie fails on many levels: editing, writing, shooting angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this movie - it was bad - the chef's food was probably bad. I've never seen Indian movies for six years (Bollywood) seen something so bad.
