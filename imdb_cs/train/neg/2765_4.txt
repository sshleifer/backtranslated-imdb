How this movie was shot with an estimated budget of $ 70 million, and without a complete rebuilding it's out of my reach. The story and the dialogue are out of amateur. The characters say that none of them would ever say and almost never responds to what was said before. No one seems to be based on a real world. It causes the leadership to be right, given that writing is so crazy ... but several actors in supporting roles really attract production down. Heroes should probably have their own credit, it was so special - not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the picture. Finally, the film about L.A. besieging giant reptiles, this movie is shocking boring. What a shame! If you see it, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking about ways you could take SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it was not much.
