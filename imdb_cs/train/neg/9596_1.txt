They simply do not try to celebrate any part of this film. It was a rough basket. At first you might think that you are for visually stunning cinematography ... and then shortly afterwards you will be hit by a big bag of FAIL! The fight is hardly fighting, playing on the edge of the steam, and music is not worth describing. It's just enough of a story that created an excuse to make this film. The decisions that make the characters and the way they deal with these situations are weak and do nothing but disappoint me. I think the only reason this movie came about was to act as a bit of a fan with Yumiko Shaku.
