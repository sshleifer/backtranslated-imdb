My roommates and we've almost cut our television program from the many spits we've done in watching this jolly work of the seventies that has become a pseudo-sentient marketplace. I have read about this camp for ages and searched my local late night TV recordings for the Years that have been searching for this elusive turd. A few years ago, our local ABC branch was known for its cold night-time weekends (eg "Frogs," "Night of the Lepus", etc.) Shows cool movements. One day it happened: on Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) it was at 1:40 that night! We had more than 15 people and the film NEVER disappointed! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith as Jay Davidson's Strongest and Most Fierce Thief in "Stargate"! William Shatner sports a whole range of things on the head that only slightly resemble human hair (or something organic, it matters). Hear! jaw dropping impassable 1970s psychobabble that makes "Chicken soup for soul" sounds like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> You feel! A content that is every decade better than 70. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the conspiracy surrounds a bunch of middle-class middle classes who decide to suck on their s head of head (Griffith ) by joining him on a cross-dessert plant that spreads between California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets and are looking for more Christopher Street than anything else. He will stop at Cantina, get drunk, smoke knuckles (see Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes the joint is an image you will not soon forget), starts fighting, attempts to rape, and just acts like a bunch of suburban middle-class connections. Although I have an excellent copy I made on TV, I would like this video to be released on the video so that the whole world could enjoy its half-baked curl.
