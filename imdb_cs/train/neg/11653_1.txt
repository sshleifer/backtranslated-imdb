The first one was different and funny. This attempt should never leave the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It's a weak attempt at humor. The film selects current and old movies that are reflected. This time, jokes seem to be using and passing. The audiences I saw repeated only on Hannibal's dinner and otherwise slept.
