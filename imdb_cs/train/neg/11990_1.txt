I wish I could zero this movie. Cheese effect and action. The only reason you see this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with the guy playing Brian. What a geek! I could not believe the shells! Then they talked to each other. I think they could not just keep silent but still. Of course, they had to have it too thin, not what I wanted to see. But Jared did a great job, compared to the separation of special effects. Everything from a bear after a crash was something I could do myself and better. I really doubt that Gary Paulsen had something to do with the production because the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer ever read a book when he saw nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie fell apart like a stinking goat!
