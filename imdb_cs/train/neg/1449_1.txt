First of all, before you read on, you must understand that I am not a neo-nazi, I try to understand Hitler correctly to make sure no one likes it. I found the series and found it terrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and find one: absolutely not. First, Hitler has not been angry for the rest of his life, the series shows angering Hitler, even though he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact it is very likely that Hitler was actually gay and fought for his entire life to defeat this secret. Third, people hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to gain power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point I found in conversations with people who live near or far from him (of course not Jews). This series was terrible because if you think Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course not at all charming, you're wrong. If you think so, you will allow people like this to gain power in the countries and you do not want it. If you really understand how Hitler came to power and stopped thinking it was terrible, you could find dangerous policies like him (of course, remember that he was elected) and stop the topic before it is too late. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> it is only terrible to show us the truth, if Hitler continues to see, the next will be the first.
