As the front cover says "The village of our time, for our time". I had to study this film version of Hamlet right after watching the version of Keneth Branagh and it was really disappointing. /> <br /> This version has a different approach to several aspects of the game, including sexuality; one very homosexual Oscar, and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that for the time (1960s) it was a very well-executed version of Hamlet, but it can not compare it to Branagh's complete version. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found a video at my local Australian video store) and actually I'm looking for a DVD Keneth Branagh to buy if there's any such thing at all. If anybody knows, please tell me.
