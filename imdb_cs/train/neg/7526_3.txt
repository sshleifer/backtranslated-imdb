This is a high-quality cheese fuse B kung fu film. Bruce "wannabe" Lee plays Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, show Bruce quick clips and close-ups of his eyes, and if you're at a right time in the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You'll be laughing at the stunningness of the movie's braiding too good, but some cool faded scenes from Enter the Dragon fit into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by an arrow when hung from a helicopter. Of course, he thinks it can justify Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, although his character is Bruce's brother (who for some reason still has Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very POORLY). See how Bruce goes one by one with a cowardly left. The detachment of props stopped at Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong when he defeats the crippled man wildly. At the end, the director decided "let's recall" the scene just shown 3 minutes ago! They had to think that only one single-celled organism with disturbance can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
