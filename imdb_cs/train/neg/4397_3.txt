One of my friends with my sisters gave me this game and it's so damn hard! It plays the look of a child's game, but you have to learn to do a lot of complex moves that require you to turn around and turn your hands into a variety of unpleasant positions and you have to look for seemingly infinite levels for 100 notes to improve your score! You must also find these incredibly hidden puzzles that require you to do almost impossible tasks! AND I WERE ONLY INTO THREE STATIONS !!!!! Perhaps if you have no life, you can stay at home all the time you get some fun, but otherwise stay away! AND DEFINITION WE RECOMMEND FOR CHILDREN - INCREASING YOUR HAIR IN THE HOUR!
