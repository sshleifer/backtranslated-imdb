I really liked it, but in the end it's a badly shot movie with too little laughter. Politics is in place, it will be hell of the Republicans, but that's what it's been designed to do. This in itself gives the reason why she giggles. The problem is that it seems to have been done in real hurry (about a week). And it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely out of the question. Turiqistan is apparently Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries with the United States of the 1950s. Humor is a bit dark (the amputee dancing with Tamerlane's prosthetic legs), but it's a brand, especially with companies that take on a lot of satire criticizing the US for "democracy lite"! It seems to be terribly heavy and working. I think this is in contradiction with so much bs of propaganda, so people have to cross over to get it. Who knows. I prefer starting, blinking - a bit of softness. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could watch again, maybe I did not want something. <br /> <br /> I hope the "W" is more on the track.
