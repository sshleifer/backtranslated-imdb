When I noticed she was broadcasting "Hamish Macbeth" in the United States, I was excited. Then I had the misfortune to look at the matter. I love the books of M.C. Beaton about a gorgeous Scottish policeman. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The forces that are responsible for this mish-slush probably never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. Apart from the lack of familiar characters, it seems to me that the whole show is outraged. It seems the actors feel they have to scream on their lines and scream at each other. If you love the adorable Hamish Macbeth from M.C. Beaton, do not waste time on this waste.
