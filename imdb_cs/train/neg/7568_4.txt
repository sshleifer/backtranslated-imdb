Chan Wook Park is nothing, if not inventive. I'm CYBORG, but it's okay, it's full of entertaining little technical flourishes with some genius thoughts that have been sprinkled between them. If he tries to walk in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet, the park goes on a fantastic, cheerful story that is a radical departure from its usual morbid tariff. As soon as a man turns to his ambition or vision, he is really unexpected that he sees that all the efforts of the Park contribute so little. I'm CYBORG, but it's okay, it seems to me amazing to subtract from me how it goes, with the final result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are abundant, and unconventional humor is rich, but it all fails to create a meaningful relationship with the audience. The characters are cute and weird and they play with the mood of cast, but try how I could not bring it to take care of her. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a mistake, perhaps suggesting that Park was a little pondering, but he still managed to show off some of the director's unique flares and was implacably forgiven after impressive filmography. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is obvious. I'm CYBORG, but it's OK that he left me so completely unengaged I caught himself instinctively fast passing from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY 5/10 and it probably does not deserve more than 3. For the older time I will be generous: 4/10
