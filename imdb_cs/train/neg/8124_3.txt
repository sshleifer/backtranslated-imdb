A film that shoots scenes of a scenic cave trip. <br /> <br /> Do not forget someone from this movie except Michael Pataki, who resisted extreme pain like JC in "The Five Hard Dangers". She's really an annoying sheriff I've done when he's crawling our furious doctor. Probably most of the laughter that you have is with the epileptic seizures of Dr. Becka from nowhere. Could Mrs Beck be wooden? Seriously, if you have made a 4-leg branch, stuck in a hot tub, you will not be able to notice the difference. The horror and the tension look at the hours that ask when the credits have broken. See it as a late night movie, MSTified, but you are not out of the way.
