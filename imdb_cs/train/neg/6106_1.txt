It was terrible that the plot was fine, but the rest was bad. I think you come to the puppet and then even try to make the film digitally and it's even worse! Under normal circumstances, I would like a low-budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and it almost made me want to return the file that appeared. I have about ten low-budget movie files with similar 6-8 movies and I have to say that it's a worst movie of all. Also, the text is off and they use fake plastic puppets that do not even look real, they could use one that looked even a little closer to the real one to save time and money and watch out for the horror movie.
