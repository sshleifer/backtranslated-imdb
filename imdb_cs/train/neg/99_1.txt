Some of the films you pick up for a pound are quite good - 23rd century films have cast dozens of obscure Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore has released some of Fulccia's films, most of their production is crap like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not as unpleasant as the Dorm's body. In addition, it is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of the Lego House, built around the house. <br /> <br /> It was somewhere else, but you really have to worry about a movie that puts previews of the action in its order of credits, so when you get to the zombie attacks you've seen it all already. <br /> <br /> Bad fans of the movie will have the ball tracking 18,000 continuity of error and devilish acting (especially the tracker who was so bad that he laughed a bit) and kudos to Hardgore for getting into the spirit of things, that he made such a bad press that I felt like watching some hitting video camping at home. <br /> <br /> Amazing, terrible things. We all did things like that when we got into the camera, but common sense prevailed, and these movies somewhere dying in our closets. Avoid.
