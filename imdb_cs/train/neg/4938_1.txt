The cave was by far the greatest amount of bullshit I've ever missed. This Geico-based ad show is less entertaining than the real 30-second Geico ad. The ice cream was the least painted, hardly imagining a cave with precious white teeth, even when she went to a dentist. This show could have the potential for a funny series if they could get a cast out of ads that would cause frightening shows. Perhaps if the writers were the same in Geico ads, it could have a chance, instead of a good story line missing from the pilot. I give this exhibition 1 out of ten, I'd like to put 10 out of zero, but that was not an option. I pray for the rapid death of this show, I would have given her less than 5 episodes before the death died.
