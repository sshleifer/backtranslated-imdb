The zombie revolt has no redemption. I'm tired of people who claim it's not that bad and that the effects had to be more packed in 1936. I suspect this is not true: it's not that IQ has risen sharply over the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored as the average viewer today. Why? Just try watching the first scenes and counting breaks between things, a terrible choice when cutting close up, editing slapdashu, which seems to contain extra extra seconds for each screen to eliminate the run. Watch out for a totally redundant dialogue: "I want to make tea / go out / read a book now." "Are you?" "Yes, I am." This kind of exchange happens several times. Normally, I would like to be a huge fan of bad movies, but watch that clumsy actors murmur with their tribe and boring lines, and all the desire to laugh at the movie will slowly disappear. This kind of uninterested pottery waste is much worse than energetic, imaginative mind blowers such as Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus being married. Those who claim to be "better" than the more interesting films have a retrospective of entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs openly in amazement: it's bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly closing in with boredom. Which is much worse.
