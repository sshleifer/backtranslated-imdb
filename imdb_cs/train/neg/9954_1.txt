From the beginning to the end, it is the most emotionally recorded film about NEVER what I've ever seen. Characterization and interaction between the title character and the character of Martha Kller are pure torture. The racetrack as a metaphorical trick is so exaggerated that it borders the clich√©, but director Pollack treats every hair twist as if it were something of great importance. Perhaps there is some value to play some MSFT3000 scenes, like Pacino, to get in touch with his inner wife for that, but even such a random humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
