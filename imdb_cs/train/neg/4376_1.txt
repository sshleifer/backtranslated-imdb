OK, it's happening, wait for me to find that there is no really recognizable conspiracy, just this series of optically fuzzy sexual scenes associated with scenes of photographers who photographed pretty ladies (Sometimes a combination of two) Then a demon comes around killing men, raping and kills women and poets about the meaning of life. Moronic special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside, you get what you expect from a movie with such a name.

DVD Extras: Subtitles Interview with director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 (Part 2 is on DVD Entrails of Beautiful Woman); and theatrical tailer <br /> <br /> My rating: F
