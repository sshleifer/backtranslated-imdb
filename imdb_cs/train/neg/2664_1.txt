The restless, clich√© thriller has a young couple doing cross-country research on the most infamous murder of America, becoming road partners with a chilly young woman and her hint of a friend - who is a real psycho. Arty and alienation, the film tone alternates between pseudo-irony and silly flashes. Maybe well, but eventually ridiculous. The performance of Brad Pitt as a low-cost killer is divine. * z ****
