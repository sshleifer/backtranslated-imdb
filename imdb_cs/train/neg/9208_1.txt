If you did not know better, you would have believed the Christian moral majority in their sermon about young sins, their search for Satan, and Hell just intertwined with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> None of these items carry one grain of truth, people. This work does nothing but give Southern Baptists a chance to breathe while the film continues to break out of their erroneous and alarming views on the creative and original gaming system. Tom Hanks contributed stellar performance to this work, but it was not enough to save it. It's bullshit. It's under crap. It's the ignorance of breeding ignorance and as such, it's nothing NEVER since ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
