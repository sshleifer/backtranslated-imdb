This film began with good intentions, the scientist Bacon, to test invisibility theory, and Shue is as cute as usual. Everything is falling apart, it's now your typical Hollywood thriller, shot on sound scenes with special effects, without any humor, joke or soul. In other words, do not waste time tracking it. Get an audiocassette cassette with John DeLance as an invisible person, where Leonard Nimoy plays. Now it was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
