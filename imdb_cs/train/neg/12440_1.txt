This is the worst damaged brain, an ultra cheap, super stupid, stupid, absurd piece of waste I've ever seen, incredible garbage of instant cult status among bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood is "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me say it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that. Special Effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". - Acting ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's really bad. But if you're looking for such incredible movies, it's for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many wonderful horror films, Price-Corman-Poe and some great things, but with "star creatures" going straight to Z. Of course, my 1 out of 10 works otherwise if you want to watch the bad movies for fun (the guy playing Indian boss is great), so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
