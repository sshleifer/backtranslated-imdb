Absolutely deep adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Cruel and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and the painful story of a mommy friend who wanted to send that boy to a military school to get him out of the way, makes it totally unsuitable for the kids who most likely want to see because books (3-8 ) years old. Do not waste money, time, or good judgment.
