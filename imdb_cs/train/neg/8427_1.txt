Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man, seemingly unable to strive for his dreams because of his poisoning, manipulative father, it was incredibly light and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 ratings without reservation. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Few of the nature of the TV show is successfully transferred to the movie. This film has a very sad, depressing tone that has led me to tears several times. When I see that Harold is defeated in a pub (and not comically), it's not my idea of ​​a comedy, but it's definitely one of the reasons why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The film was painfully dysfunctional, except for the scene where Albert is sinking in a sink and seen by a neighbor. The romance between Harold and Zitou is totally uncontrollable and I wonder if the filmmakers have ever bothered watching the TV series. In the television series, Harold always went to honorable girls, not strippers. Alberto's reaction to notes against Harold's girlfriends was totally invaluable in television series. In the film, Albert says practically nothing when such an opportunity rises. Most film spin-offs of UK sitcoms tend to be quite boring, with the exception of ON THE BUSES (which in some respects was actually better than the TV series itself!). But STEPTOE and SON must be placed directly at the bottom of the pile, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip it and look at the second spin-off, STEPTOE and SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series and is really fun.
