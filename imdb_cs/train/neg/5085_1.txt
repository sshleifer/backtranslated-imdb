this movie starts with a funeral ... and it takes so hard on this simple funeral that I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching and started jumping scenes. it seems to me, whoever caused this film to be hit in a trap in a permanent morbid trance can not think of anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of those dark kids from Southpark, I want a movie that got me into an interesting story within 10 minutes, I will not sit and watch 10 minutes to prepare for the funeral. My grandmother in her last years was fascinated by the funeral you would enjoy this "movie".
