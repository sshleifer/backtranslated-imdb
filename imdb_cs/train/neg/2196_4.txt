A mosaic (or head) that would not die is one of the much-thoughtful low budget films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how this repulsive sexist could be written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are repeatedly expressed by women's leadership, Ginny Leith - a separate head kept alive by the machine, I-Vs and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was designed to use and critique gender stereotypes. Tones of the blasted box Helena. Genderism is abundant and irritating as an army of angry ants. Dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and incredible, and acting is just OK (but not consistent). Why did I make this movie 4? Because some thought it was clear. I'm really not sure where the movie really tried, but it seems clear that he's trying to get an extraordinarily nervous and brutal sort of horror (without the blood and guts awaiting today's audience). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie and none of the characters is particularly suitable. <br /> <br /> They all considered it a pretty painful and disturbing sight of early American pop sex in the 1960s from the point of view of a woman who remained alive despite her missing body after a lethal crash . Her lover is threatening to stitch her fresh, high-quality body and force her to continue with him. She is, of course, not plussed all over and forced to meet a creature that is almost as great as her friend. Oh, there are also some vague references to cliches from the 1950s and 1960s about bad science. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Students B and Students of Postgraduate Studies in Gender Studies.
