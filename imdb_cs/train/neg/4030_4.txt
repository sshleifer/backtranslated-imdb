I remember watching a "missed missile" (actually, when my brother and a few cousins ​​in which I was a guest overnight agreed to watch me - I was from time to time Eric Cartman from the 1960s - boys) and somewhat embarrassed when a steady wave of millions of degrees of heat emerged as a drawing device - even as a second degree, I knew that a mere rocket could simply not bring energy around that tremendous heat or devastation more than a duration and limited radius of nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My perpetuation of the fact that Turkey on affectionate relatives was suicidal crime. The production values ​​of the film were very good. The game is not bad (except for a castman's actor who played a helper governor that someone else mentioned here). But the thought on the rocket Easy-baking Earth's surface with the heat of his exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> How do people in "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss the "Lost Missile", anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch if you want to make some beer for a weekend.
