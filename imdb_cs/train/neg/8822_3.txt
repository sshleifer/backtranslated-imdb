Depending on your personal state of mind, when you watch it, "Christmas Evil" can either become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most poor and furiously ravenous monsters ever made on vacation. I personally tried to decide for the other because I did not bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheerful and undemanding morning 1980s slasher with a nutcase in Santa Claus costume tossing people. Poorly! The film actually deals with a toy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage factory, and considers his duty to decide on Christmas Eve that deserves gifts and who deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he was a witness to Santa? his father in the costume apparently? to caress his naked legs at a young age. Then he developed into social expropriation by irritating his younger brother, who is about to attack one (holi) day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate this somewhat eccentric horror film, but really have to be so boring? There are several uninterrupted and seemingly infinite parts of the movie, in which nothing is ever happening. I can forgive the inconvenience of bleeding and cruel bloodshed, but this film does not even suffer from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly demented conspiracy plot (with a remarkable exception to the final, I have to admit). I would also take this term more seriously if the crazy protagonist had focused on the fatal punishment of naughty children! He does not and exclusively kills the bad adults. How can you take a serious, controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa even did not commit an unfortunate child murder? This would cause "Christmas Evil" to be a classic, while now it's just a forgotten and annoying piece of junk mail.
