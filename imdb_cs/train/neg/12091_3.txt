Well, Cannes artyfartyrati may have liked this movie, but I'm not afraid. If you like the type of movie where the shots take so long that you're wondering that the actor has slept or the cameraman gone for lunch, it may be for you. A large part of this is with short stays in the area of ​​inconvenience. I did not find it shocking or disturbing, like some other reviewers - simply a little awkward and insignificant. The only reason I did not give this star is that acting is laudable and the film is pretty well shot. However, the story does not recommend. A large part of the film simply shows a disgusting woman teaching or listening to a piano, which can appeal to some people. But to think it's pretty harmless, get ready for some abductions of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
