As a low budget indies to go, you usually find that you get what you pay and let me just say I do not pay much for "Frightworld" ... Writer / Director: David R. Williams brings us a story about a deserted amusement park, besieged the revenge of the killed serial killer. This is not a bad assumption, but it is done with a relatively low budget error. Working with the camera is trying to be too detachable for its audience by constantly using restless quick cuts that cover the fact that they really do not have anything that would turn out to be bleeding or scary. This becomes obvious from the bat because we met the future killer and soon we realize that (acting) is the worst thing that's going on ... After a painfully long series of titles, we are brought back to modern times. negotiations remain the same. "Frightworld" creates rather unique cinematography when it depicts the scenery from inside a fun house but with an extremely long duration, can not save the film from its inferior indie of hell. <br /> <br /> There is some average nudity, but not much for the gore, which is mostly saving mercy for these types of movies. Fans of really bad B films could find something interesting otherwise they would not spend a lot of money.
