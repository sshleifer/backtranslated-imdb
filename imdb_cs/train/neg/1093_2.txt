Kitten Natividad of film fame Russ Meyer plays Chastity Knott, a woman who finds her breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) That has healing abilities. After descending on some of this fruit (which looks like plastic banana on stalks), the courage is endowed with some mystical magic powers, thanks to which is the superhero, specifically The Double D Avenger. Note that they also wear panties as a mask. In written form, it all sounds pretty good. In performance, it is much more than just a little. Chastity seems to have a pub and the local band is upset because she takes her business, so some strippers (including Haji, as well as Russ Meyer's film fame) are going to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the form of Double D Avenger. Be careful to do a "spin wonder woman" that changes into her clothes and loses her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double candidates fly as if they were not tomorrow. With an unbeatable dance song that is played over and over, it appears as a show of "live action", which is composed of the 70s, with adult content, although it is not rated, it may well get away with the PG-13. And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars are well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movie look great. A special look from Forest J. Ackerman, but so what. Very stupid and I will never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the lid. 2 out of 10.
