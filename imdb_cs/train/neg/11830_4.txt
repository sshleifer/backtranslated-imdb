OK, maybe 13 years old as I was a little old for this movie. It's about this pampered rat who lives in the palace. Then the diving rat rinses him into the toilet! He ends up in this rat town and meets this rat girl who has the gem that wants a greedy frog. He will do anything for this gem, sending the whole army after these two rats. He plans to take a gem and flood the city of rats! The chilled part about this movie is a slug. They do all the sound effects. They sing, they make sounds, it's amazing, but it's nice too. The OK bottom line is focused on 7 years. Another wise, great movie that younger family members will see. I did not think animation was a real art art, like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey a little calmed down. The film was just decent, but it's not worth $ 9.50 for it, I'm sorry.
