This movie started to be fun, but quickly worsened. I thought it would be much more adult-oriented humor, based on the first moments, but then the film changed to the bad type for the Disney Channel, especially the go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The film looked and sounded very independent and low budget. One very cute moment, which I will call only a serenade scene, but overall it was a yawn. Laughter is very little and far. The ultimate surprise for Mr. Fix It is so ridiculous that I was going crazy more than anything else. Maybe it's worth seeing if you can capture it for free or television, but do not waste money by buying or renting this movie.
