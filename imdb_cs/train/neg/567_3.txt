This film is one of the worst movies ever he has ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in the movie? Is she a singer, not an actor who kills guitar vampires? And what a terrible plot? My God really upset this movie. At the end, the queen of vampires is played by eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by a vampire army, but when "fantastic" murderers arrive, only 4 vampires will pass! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? Are they in the sun? And what about "Grand finally" when Bon Jovi blows off his shotgun head ??? This is really "NOT". In "Buffy Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes there is no vampire killed with SHOTGUN ??? It really is a lack of originality!
