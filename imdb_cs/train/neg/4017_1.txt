Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the genre of adult film. Still I did not like it at all. The woman who commits suicide in a scene that fits into horror film gets the opportunity to return to Earth briefly to live a life of desire she has never done before in her life. Crappy sexual scenes follow. Why they are miserable for one who is trying to be an artistic way to get rid of real sexual behavior. I think we're looking at sex porn. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way but is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in this are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive leading actress and it will not help. If you find that leadership in your adult film is not appealing, there is not much artistic imagination that would make me like the movie. Sexual scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I think one of them is a snake. So for me, this movie just fails because it does not stir me at all, but rather turns me off.
