Quite interesting exciting black and white swing written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-occupied and remarkably attractive. He recalls that Renee Zellweger has bad hair. This chick produced only two of these films and then returned to Texas. Music is terrible. One of her friends plays Sam Melville (from THE ROOKIES) with a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in the movie by Tony - "You give me a doll" chickens let me in ". Good black-and-white cinema by Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locations (cold pool, which is also used in DEFILERECH). Strange ending, but appropriate. A 4 of 10. Stacey Walker's best performance.
