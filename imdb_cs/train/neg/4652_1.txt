It was a painful example of cheap, boring and non-original shows produced by Australian television stations that meet local content quotas. Writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that writers are those who are responsible for the worst Australian film in the recent memory of Honorable Wally Norman. Nothing in this TV series was fun - never - nor funny. It was just tired and BAD, and the worst thing was that it was really funny. It was just embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very suss about this show that gets 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find (real) a (real) Australian viewer's show (not much) and that's impossible. Or fool. There are loaves of bread that are more fun than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at any price and if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laugh it deserves was unintentional.
