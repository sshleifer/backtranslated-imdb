The US seems to be in charge of the British police, who are all running teeth armed and you know that CID officers will change to uniform when they stop working and go down the pub! It must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of the "real" British police, which has ever been unsuspecting to the public. I see Mr. Snipes might need the money to pay his tax, but what a good actor like Charles Dance is doing is in that secret. Worse than worse low budget "B" 50. flight. An hour and a half suicides, and I will never come back. Avoid it as a real plague.
