Jenny Neumann (from sexploitation flick MISTRESS OF APES, American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who has a leading role in the Australian scene. She is a virgin, because she saw a girl see her mom having sex and then accidentally caused a car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, the killer around the black gloves around the theater smashes people through the glasses. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, after murders bleeding hands from her hands and sees killing a baby hunched with a broken bottle like a little girl!), but it has an unreasonable heavy breathing POV camera and hides the killer's identity to the very end as if it were a big surprise. The entire cast seems to be obsessed with talking, having or trying sex and in one case even blackmailing their way to getting laid. There's a lot of nudity and blood, but it's not a sense of continuity, the photo is dark, and editing (from Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The theater environment for the movie slasher precedes the Soavi film of the same name and Argento OPERA (both are better than this one) for five years and Neumann is quite hot.
