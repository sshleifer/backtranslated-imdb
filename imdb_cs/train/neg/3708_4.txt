Down on Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white man. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The film has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, an animated comedy in 2005, is better. That's a good movie, but Chris Rock did a lot better than this. You will only mix about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really a laugh. You will laugh and you may be giggling, but you will not laugh.
