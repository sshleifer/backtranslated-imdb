My first attempt to track it ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the television report scene I could not handle. It was like this: Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think they're aliens. * Unfortunate silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... A few days later I watched it until the end and it was not as bad as I imagined, but there are serious problems with it. About half the plot can be easily eliminated. And the other half should be extended to explain the background story or something. What is the use of detective, eugenic people and monsters that Horus instantly destroys? More fun was a monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who have lived for one time and all the games in the multiverse where we play the monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks consistent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The second half is terribly missing. What did our protagonist do to get frozen? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end? He had those unpleasant followers, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the deal with the masked guy? How did a bloody girl appear? What's with her eyes? Etcetera, etc. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's more or less fine when you ignore Egyptian gods that look like walking with rotweiler heads.
