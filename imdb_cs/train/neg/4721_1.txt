Before you look at this film, look at reviews available on the Internet about counterfeiting of event films, especially its refutation about the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslims were shot dead from Srebrenica and shot dead by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Watch this movie critically and read reviews in advance. Most reviews claim that the documentary has its arguments too far, even though it raises questions that focus on the conventional wisdom of war. A review by NYTimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be "inaccurate to mark this document as pro-Serbian," but questions should be asked about how to present facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and omitting these facts to hate Serbian forces . I do not advise against seeing this document, but I warn you that you will examine it with a critical eye (as it should always be the same).
