I also saw an amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the London science fiction festival. If you have to look at this thing, do it with a large audience best after a few beers, then you can get some experience from it. <br /> <br /> I found the cheerful dialogue stored in my mind is a Cremator performance. Animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and badly executed. Perhaps it was a good idea for the producers to hire at least one person who was not color blind. There is nothing else that would be true, this film is a failure at all levels.
