Okay, so I went to this movie, which really did not expect much, that I realized it was an action movie similar to fast and furious. Some nice cars of some nice girls a rather decent plot. Unfortunately, I would have to say that was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were pretty and the girls were okay, but the way they put the film together was just bad enough to be nice. The story never cared about the cast and the movie looked just together. So, overall, this movie was not the worst, but if you were looking for a movie that would go on this weekend, I'd give it to me so far.
