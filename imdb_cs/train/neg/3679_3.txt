It's a Japanese movie, but there's also a little English that's spoken here. It's a pretty nice movie with beautiful visual similarity, representing the picturesque beauty of Hawaii. But it was the only redeemed quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who would want to watch a young woman who will have 90 percent of the movie because her "image" husband is a lot older than he advertised? Sure, it could be a bummer ...... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does it make a face and love it. At that time it was too little for most audiences - too late. By then, we were asleep.
