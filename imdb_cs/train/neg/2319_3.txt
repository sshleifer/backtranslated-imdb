Many stupid plot of holes in the movie. At first we see him watch his kung fu, and I am dying in the middle of his practice. That's fine with me. And then we see at the end of the movie that he used the kung-fu he had just learned by watching his master when he was still a child. Is it even possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This show is purely for fans of Jay Chou, and the film lacks depth in character development, cinematographic styles, and plotting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Long hair, a view of the sun and the boy, tall and strong. Two of them looked like they came out of a mass production factory that was supposed to produce the products that make teenage girls in orgasm. Not that these two actors had nothing to do with the film industry as a whole. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The scene of four Masters Jay Chou, who has come back to help him out on a basketball court, has plunged into an unnecessary conspiracy when they started throwing away their opponents like Royal Rumble. Worse of all, when the four masters won the fight, the crowd began to cheer and the game continued. Was it really WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show when they win the game, all thanks to the excellent skills of kung fu Jay Chou. Getting the kung-fu skills is a secret, because the show certainly proves that he has acquired the skills only by watching his master. And then his long-lost father comes out of the woodwork to recognize Jay Chou because his long lost son seemed a bit quicker than the director to wrap the film. In short, this is Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual "click"). . Watch this only when Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those with a taste in movies that is very similar to those on the list of 250 IMDb movies of all time, then this movie is not for you.
