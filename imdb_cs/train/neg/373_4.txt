Blank Check is a movie I've ever seen on TV and like most of the movies she's broadcast on TV. Blank Check was not that good. Especially nobody I've met with has seen Blank Check, and that includes people who grew up in the 90's. Also, an empty check will not be remembered in 00, nor simply because it will be overshadowed by pixar movies. I would not call Blank Make sure the bad movie, but it's not really fun one. (At least no one older than 6 years) Blank Check is not a fun movie because none of it is original. Everything just makes you go "what I have not seen yet?" Empty control breaks out and tries to take everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which is strangely enough both in it by Macaulay Culkin). Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to disappear into the unknown.
