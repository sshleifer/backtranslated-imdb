I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish he was in more movies that showed his talent. With this said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. I have to say that I have almost put all the blame on the bad screenplay. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley has a superb performance in American beauty, Melissa Sagemiller has done well, and Eliza Dushka is currently the Hollywood girl. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script and I understand why. Let's say this movie belongs to the genre of horror, it is overestimate. It was a twist that you'd expect, but it just did not work anywhere ... except for bigger confusion. I have just found out that the end is very counter-climatic because it did not seem to make sense or really answer any of the questions I had about the story. I wish I could give this movie good reviews, but I can not. In all honesty, the only thing I think you will like is that you paid for it.
