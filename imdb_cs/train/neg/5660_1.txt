I'm glad I've read so many negative comments about the Tritrov plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like the rough character of the house and its intelligence, but it really does not like the opponents of this ongoing plot. It will spell out the true nature of the hospital story and angry at police authority. There must be a place of care for the sick to all who are in the care. There seems to be many controversial legal aspects of what Tritter really does. He himself can not freeze accounts and have the power to stop the doctor from writing prescriptions for patients. The lot of providence he shows also hurts the sick patients in the hospital and is not a good story to portray. I voted for this episode horrible not because of the story itself, but when you put a piece of Trittor, it will turn me away and the rest of the plot will hurt. People say they hate watching stories. Please change. Get Tritter out.
