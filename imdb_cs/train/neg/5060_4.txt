This film is the perfect adaptation of English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran, that Olivier and Malik are the perfect role of the wife cheating on Lane. They changed the other half of the film to adapt to Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even the movie has complete traces of unfaithfulness even though it has failed to get back to its original state. It was a cheap left porno of Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran has made more roles of this type and was even nicknamed serial killer. In the future, if Indian directors plan to take over English film, they have to look at the feasibility of a conspiracy with Indian censors. Although the film bombed at the box office, the actor was given inadequate recognition. In the future, directors should be a little more careful when rebuilding the nominated Oscar. <br /> <br /> They all said it was not a family movie, so take special care and watch it at home with your family.
