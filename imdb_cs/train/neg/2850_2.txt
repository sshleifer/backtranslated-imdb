If I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have seen it. It's humiliating to the Japanese, unhappy with Hollywood, and unpleasant to every thinker. But then most of John Wayne's films are such. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved the Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The film focuses on the 19th century Japanese isolationism. Perhaps it is Hollywood, which should be isolated. To make it as fast as possible, this movie is a terrifying jingoistic scream (a little Madam Butterfly with bad music.)
