It is hard to believe that after fourteen years we have been waiting with this kinematic waste. The original was a dark thriller with a big impact, which achieved a "cult" status that proves the fine arts of the cinema according to Paul Verhoeven's instructions. This film does nothing, it does nothing, and eventually unfolds in a large box of unsuccessful sequels. The initial sequence could have brought about an interesting set of fence development using highly talented and capable casts. Unfortunately, we are 90 minutes of dissertation work in Catherine Tramell's life ... or Sharon Stone. Maybe it's a combination of both. If the desire is too visible to continue the sensually provocative delusion of sex as in "B.S.1", forget about it. You end up with a soft porn boredom that ultimately maintains the old reputation that a woman may be more challenging in clothing than from them. It is interesting to note that the beautiful Charlotte Rampling was shot in 1966 by GEORGY GIRL when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. She is a very talented actress who is really perfect when he holds her here as well. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan, you have to see and review this movie using your own rating system. If this is not the case, you can wait for the release of the DVD in the "rated" version, the "unrated" version, the "collector" release or the "highest" version and hopefully in the next 14 years we will be amazed by the new "Basic Instinct 3" 62 years and nobody really cares about her.
