Although I rated this film as 2, which showed a total lack of effort in creating a high-quality horror film, it was ten on an unintentional humorous scale. I could not figure out what's happening in the movie, or who are people, but I did not care, because I knew that every scene would have something to laugh at me. Dialogue is minimal throughout the movie, but I believe it's because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no line of action makes the film very universal. It does not matter if you sit and watch the movie from start to finish or if you watch going back, you will be confused. I especially like the scene where the prisoners alternate around each other and beat each other with their thumbs. I believe the doctor treats it as a treatment. Genius!
