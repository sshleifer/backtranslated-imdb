A wicker man. I'm so angry that I can not write any comment on this movie. This conspiracy was ridiculous, thin, tied up together, and just misty. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I suppose since you were in that it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt that the huge parts of the film were left on the floor and even when it was complete - the film was just unusual and stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, you are left with your mouth, aggressiveness and soothing taste. I have never heard that so many people leave theater on the opening day with such a great hatred. People complained in small groups in the department store, four floors from the theater at the entrance. It's so bad. I heard it compared to: Glitter, the American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My friend was so crazy he would not talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
