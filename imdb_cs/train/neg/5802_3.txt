The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" was re-recorded and made available to home video in the US via Faith Films. The original story concerns a priest who must follow the body of the witch only by his faith to protect him. Very widespread and deployed in America, although in Russia they are clearly shot (houses, clothing and equipment are bad despite English characters), it's a special film that really does not work. Part of this is a strange environment that is very hard trying to be an American, but it is clearly not. There are also strange, deliberately sloping moments, as the main character is initially a journalist and priest shortly later. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching a piece on DVD) Another problem is dubbing, which is out of horror. It's so far that everyone talks when their lips are not in the camera - or if the voices do not even match the hairs of the hair. I do not know if his Faith Films bug or that the producers who made the film hoping to venture into the West (unveiled in making a piece). The film is not very good. As I said, he has a variety of technical problems that make him a special charm. Despite some really good-looking horror films, the movie never works as a horror movie. As a film that raises faith, translating is too confused in this translation so that someone can feel closer to God. Given that I gave him a choice, I would give him a pass, even for a good price. My advice would be to find the version of the 1960s Viy, which brings both a bit of trembling and a belief in God.
