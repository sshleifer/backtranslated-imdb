Brokedown Palace is not such a movie I would ever like to see. I also did not like the film when an Aussie man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danese and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I do not want to go to this country no matter what I saw this movie. In fact, this movie has thwarted. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful women. Germany is a country I tolerate. I'd rather stay in the United States. After seeing a movie in the theater, including a fake allegation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and the money was returned because I can not tolerate this film. If you're going to Thailand to meet someone who could be a drug smuggler, forget it!
