The unnecessary minutes of my life. I fell asleep for the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say that I was not someone who'd ever slept in the cinema. I have never seen such a meaningless conspiracy, a forced way, and we can only assume that the actors were as hard as the writer of the protagonists allegedly in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this awesome adaptation is exaggerated. And if it is not a wood act, almost as if you could see a teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlapping and interferes with utterly unnecessary paths and overcome unimaginably, is enough to get you out of farce. As for the predicted shock of the investigated detective, every person who does not see it-like the rest of this ridiculous conspiracy-telegraph the light years in advance, should immediately check his eyesight. <br /> <br /> Bad acting and two very decent actors associated with the Branagh hypertext reversal are enough to want to use real balls rather than blank pages. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a completely hidden sub-homoerotic, enlarged to the end. The only thing I can hope for is that it's such a flop that people will not try to imitate this level of cinema.
