They can not really be stupid than the movie that deals with the three losers who are trying to capture the university spirit during the annual festive spring holidays at many of our higher learning schools. The problem is that these defeats are trying to do it 15 years after the rail years when one is assigned to watch the daughter of a female senator who is preparing for another vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the daughter is something other than popular, but of course it all comes out. Girls go through drunken fury, exotic dance and other absolute nonsense. It really can not be much worse than that awful movie.
