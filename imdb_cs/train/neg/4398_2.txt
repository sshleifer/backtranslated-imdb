Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I've appreciated throughout my career, and that's the only reason I've decided to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regretted it! These two great actors are humiliating all the way by making a number of irrelevant, unimaginable and kitchin to extremes (not that it is bad for one's own eyes) sketches that make people laugh but fail. The only reason I think is that the director was their friend and they chose to support their film by looking at it - I can not think of it because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed since then. I would recommend that you avoid this film if you do not want your opinion of two actors to be spoiled.
