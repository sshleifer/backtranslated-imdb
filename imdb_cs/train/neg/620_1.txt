I've seen it a long time ago and I have to say: This movie is terrible. I watch funny movies for fun. The scarecrow is not fun. The scarecrow is scary. You have an incredibly ominous villain who likes screaming horror when he kills his victim (actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has a hard story he uses to justify his murders. "Everyone is looking at me, the only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer-basket, likes one of those guys who choose me, I want to kill them all, well, I'm exaggerating, but the premise for this movie is enough to be near the bottom of the list of dirty movies. <br /> <br /> Adding to what I just said is mommy promiscutively, she goes to her mother and her current boyfriend gets him on, boyfriend friend tells him to leave, kid refuses and he insists he does not want to leave his own house A friend chases a baby into a corn field Kills a baby right in front of his mother Mommy shouts proudly, friend is like: "OMG! I do not want to. "Then she tells Mommy to say nothing to the policeman, and the Kid was killed under a scarecrow, just like every child who is murdered under a scarecrow returns like a murderous scarecrow with vengeance and his victims were not so scared before. . <br /> <br /> To make it even worse, this movie was shot in an enormous 8 days, that's right, 8 days, I wanted to give this movie 2, because despite it has one or two redeemed moments (They are spoilers, so I do not get it if you want to see these bulls.) I could forgive a little for bad acting, terrible special effects, unfortunate scenario and poor camera work, but I just do not care about the lack of effort <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as I did.To see an example of how to make a movie or if you like watching bad movies like me then watch It's at your own risk. Everyone else should stay at a safe distance from this movie all the time.
