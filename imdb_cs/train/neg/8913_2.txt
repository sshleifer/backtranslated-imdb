When I first heard the news this morning, I thought, "In the end, a little fun." It was a bit of a fun week or so ... But we have to face it, these reporters (if anyone can even call it), they have too much time to play. <br /> <br /> At first I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have a little journalist in her. It is very unprofessional. Steve is still interrupting when he informs viewers of a particular message. It's really terribly annoying that I can not keep track of it. Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Damn it, it's more a celebrity that loves a celebrity. That's why he immediately transforms himself into a celebrity celebrity to talk to. She is not very professional, and she is quite likely to feel her relationship to celebrities more important than to be a journalist - and that's all I can say about her. Also (disappointing) this show has more fun news than necessary news about the world, the government, the US or something that will be beneficial and / or serve the public best interests. They are too focused on the sensation that everything they are talking about is like a commercial product. On the other hand, their reporters are excitingly tolerant ... I believe "Good Day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who really deal with news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would really like to watch KTLA, but try to be so difficult to be fun sometimes, they are still a little boring, but well, I will hold NBC "Today" ABC "Good Morning America" ​​is also ok ... until Diane Sawyer gets too serious.)
