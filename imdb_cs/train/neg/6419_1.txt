Think about ending leeward 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly calls the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar shoots - and a scary mirror <br /> <br /> Oh and underwater marine animals ... yeah ... it's not a good movie ... I really did not like it. The poster for the film is also extremely misleading, and I found out that it was just for people to suck in to watch them ... I can not believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save time and money ... go to your watch Saw III ... a movie in which writing makes you feel as if you put effort into it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and Im are out
