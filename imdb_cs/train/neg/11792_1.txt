It must be the cheapest film of the 21st century. It's a very low quality, but eventually drops below ... everything. All cheap tricks - such as blinking and darkness - are used to hide those dirty computer effects. All actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There's a scene where Anne asks, "Why do you seem so careless?" The right answer is because he can not act. No matter what happens (the world is going to ruin, her friend dies, it's burned), she has the same stupid smile in her face. It's not just a movie that's B - quality. It's also a description of the back side (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray, the capital ship and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description looks like another film, both of which feature the character of Fletcher and the sea monsters
