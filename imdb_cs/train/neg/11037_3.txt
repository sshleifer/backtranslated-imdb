I love an episode where Jim becomes Greenman. That's great! When Jim throws the little man through the window, the look on his face is invaluable. Then when he turns to the priest in his wife just to find out that she has become a whip? Great writing and great casting, along with a great acting actor, must be seen. I'm trying to find a photo from this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on the message because I think Greenman is cheerful. Does anyone know where I can download Jim's photo as Greenman? Can someone point in the right direction to find such a photo?
