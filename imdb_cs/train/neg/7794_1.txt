This movie is a terrible god. There is no quality for this movie. Do you think gore would be good, but it's bad. The effects are worse and if you can say it, it's the worst I've ever seen. This movie was probably shot on a video camera and works with a budget of around $ 500 probably. If you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap picture in a Zombie video like this, but better than watching Redneck Zombies. Avoid this movie at any cost. It is inconsistent and unnecessary. You were warned. I have nothing to say about this silly movie.
