I really did not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! Both are immature, selfish and self-respecting people. Each of them hurt anyone who plays their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but what are good if there are no characters to link to, or a story that is interesting. Should I be happy when the two psychos at last have a perfect love for each other? After watching this film, I thought, "This should be the first # French note?" <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
