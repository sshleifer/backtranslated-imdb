I see why Laurel and Hardy purists could be offended by this rather gentle "reconstruction" but this movie would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasure of classical L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain freely release a comedy duo and there is a fairly good supporting cast. I enjoyed it.
