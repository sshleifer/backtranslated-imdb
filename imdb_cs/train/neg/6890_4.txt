... except Jon Heder. This guy was dancing the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was fun. The 29-year-old son Heder lives with a widow's mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and tries to lose his pleasant life and tries to sabotage the relationship. She also meets the girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but anyone who flew Hader would be better to sell hot dogs on the beach. Heders performance is unpleasant, which would be good because playing an unpleasant guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor who loses this act by making this boy happy in the finals. Finally, you want to personally hit a person's face and you are finally disturbed at the end. In the future every movie with this guy will not be for me!
