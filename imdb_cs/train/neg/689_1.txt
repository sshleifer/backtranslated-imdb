What ... ... is this? This must undoubtedly be the biggest loss of film, settings and cameras at all. I know you can not set your expectations for the 80th slasher high, but it's too stupid to be true. I taught this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel compelled to take my money back. Can you imagine who is hard hit? Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are his motivations ??? In fact, you could not worry less. And why should you? The producers of this garbage did not care. They did not try to make a little strain. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's much easier to find money with that name) also made Kindred (1986), which was rather enjoyable and recently made Soul Survivors. Even bullshit, but at least Eliza Dushka had it. This unsolicited post has a debut Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yeah, that's right, cat Melrose Place. Her very unforgettable figure dies for about 15 minutes. after initial credits. He is the second person to die. The first victim dies right in the first minute, but no one obviously mentioned or missed it, who cares about it? The rest of the actors ... do not deserve the term really actors, they are totally uninteresting. I hope they die with quick and painful death ... and not just their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
