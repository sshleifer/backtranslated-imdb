Steven, what have you done, you hit a brand new one. It's strange because Steven's last film shadow man was run by the same director who made that waste. The shadowy man was good, it was stupid, so bad it was not funny Steven is barely in the movie and feels like a portrait, and when he's in the movie, he's just like half-naked. As for the action, let's say the Oz wizard has more action than this waste, there is no action in the movie, and when it finally comes, it's a dull depressing ill-shot action scene. Seagal hardly kills anyone, unlike his films, where a male army runs, ie under encirclement 1 and 2, and injuries occur. The conspiracy is so confusing that so many plot holes that it makes scenes ever. flying fury better good what a shame I lost 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten more happiness for the next
