One of the real slings of Boris Karloff. The essentially dying Karloff (120 years older than he was) is a scientist who needs cash to complete the experiments before he died. Moving from Morocco, where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to the south of France where he works with a doctor while trying to scrape enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he made an agreement with a rich young wife of a dying cotton man. He will finance him if he helps poison her husband to take his money and go on with the gigolo (who I think is married). If you think it was from the point of view of the movie you are wrong, I had to read what other people sent to find out that it happened. Why? because this movie lost me in two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with his many characters and several converging phrases. Little is explained and many are called until the end when I really did not care. It's a blunt mess that's only interested in Karloff's performance, which is occasionally strange. To be honest, it's the only time I've ever seen him go into the bizarre area of ​​Bel Lugosi. It's not every scene, but few people and it makes me wonder how much they've done.
