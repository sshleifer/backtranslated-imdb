"Major Payne" is a film about the main man who makes vicious hell for his small group of boys in the navy. This movie really has nothing to offer, but it offers several fun moments that are worth a lot of attention. Do not expect it to be a memorable movie. You just expect to laugh at the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the bastard boy was cheerful, and that's really all I remember about the movie except for the boys who want to avenge Major Payne. Again, this is not a great movie and is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
