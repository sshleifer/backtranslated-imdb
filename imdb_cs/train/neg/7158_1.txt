These are some of the worst acts I've ever seen. I like Nadezhda Almereyda, but that's just an absolute break. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this film is just a non-stop, bad-acting and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one is remotely good. A story is a joke, but it's not a haha. I do not even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Cancel the last hour and half of your life. How did this director make Nadja and another girl a different planet?
