For those who are too young to know or for those who have forgotten, Disney has gone down almost to the end of the 1980s. People no longer see their movies and the company does not produce the usual healthy material ... at least what people did not expect. The main problem: Fury. Yes, the idiots who have been running Disney movies for decades are producing films with promising words - including the vain name of the Lord if you believe it - scattered in these "family movies." It actually happens twice in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film has an angry tone in addition to linguistic problems, making it unbeatable from the start. Fortunately, Disney woke up and produced a lot of great material from the decadent 1980s. ("Touchstone" is Disney, under another name.)
