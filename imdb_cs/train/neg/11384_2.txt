Since Europe began fighting World War II until the end of the war, Hollywood (with significant governmental determination) made tons of films designed to try to get young men into the army by a serviceman looking "cool" . This is by far the finest, which means that a soldier's life is simple, you get the best food and you can lie all day long listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to participate in World War II, but I think it was more than that. There is the most beautiful cat's beard from the fence and lots of musical figures presenting some of today's leading acts. I do not think that until 1943 even the most active civilians knew overseas than crazy hijinks portrayed in this film. While I'm sure it should be considered as a rescue, I can not help, but I wonder if the family and beloved war-fighting men were amused or refused by this trivialization of their beloved victims.
