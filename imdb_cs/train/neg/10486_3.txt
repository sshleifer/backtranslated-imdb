My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get trusted actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast? even for supporting characters, none of which really allow this movie. But do I have to admit that Tom Hank is almost worth it? what was it about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best story of the movie was Joe Isuzu - by far the classic! The assumption is good. Basinger's character, who is struggling with the existence of Pink Lady, heads towards the Vegas motel, a motel that spreads over the famous pyramid of cosmetics. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver Elvis's suit, who will soon be motivated by his former wife. As they both make their way, they have a lot of fun with Elvis' performers who went to a concert in the state of Elves. Soon the FBI gets involved and begins to watch what he thinks is the serial killer of Elvis's impersonator. Unfortunately, the assumption does not mean that the movie was good. When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first class? when line story and continuity are not really important. It is much more fun to watch Basinger look beautifully in her pink Lady suit rather than wonder why what she does really does not make sense. The film is trying hard, but it's down. Eventually it's full of ideas that could be theoretically fun, but in practice it was not that much fun. It's not the worst, but you can feel like leaving a building one ???? Do not say I warned you!
