Based in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses tries to be a satirical look at the role of media in government. At best, this could be true for how the US is trying to control the media during the Iraq war, but ultimately it feels hollow. Never in the story is the real tension and playing is never too good. The worst thing is that the direction of the movie is terrible, focusing on the cameras' tiny angles that are nothing like "It's not a strange way to hold the camera." Special effects are pretty bad ... at one point the video about the explosion is green across the city and it's best. The film has several clear places ... namely advertisements for post-zombie services (including reclamation service and party bus). But it's too little to make the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same low production value, but behind it is much more of a joke, humor and talent.
