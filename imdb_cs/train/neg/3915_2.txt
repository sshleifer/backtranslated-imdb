This film is not only badly sketched and focused, but it's just unpleasant. The beautiful novel is modestly distorted in this film. Many changes have been made by events, probably simplifying the timeframe. But what results are simply confusing. The effect can not overcome the script that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. In addition, conversion to English does not work when everyone references the Esteban patriarch as ESteban. Grapes. Please, please read the wonderful novel, if possible, in Spanish. DO NOT KNOW THIS FILM. It will be ruining for you what could be a wonderful experience.
