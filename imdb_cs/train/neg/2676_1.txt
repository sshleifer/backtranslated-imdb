** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This immediate mess combines the hero to gun, the effects of the Z grade, the Nazis, the mummy and endless lesbian shots and it's still boring; the video is 45 minutes of SEEMS time running like Eternity. The only good part is one of the bloop outtakes, where bad guys force an egoptologist out of Â£ 400 into a chair - and one damn leg is almost crushed under the foot of an armchair. Take the snoozer back to the video store and watch TV golf, bowling or tennis.
