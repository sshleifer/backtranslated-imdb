This ABC direct TV failure has absolutely no justice for a brilliant fantasy novel that is wrinkle over time. Madeleine L'Engle brought both children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world as if there were no authors in front of her. This novel, the first in its "Quartet of Time", is beautiful life, the universe and the time itself. Yet it is easy for every child or adolescent to understand. His unwavering morality is predominant in the whole book. This film adaptation can be seen only as a mockery of Mrs L'Engle's artwork. Honestly, what did they think? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is blurry and uneven, the dialogue is exhausted, and almost every magical feature of the novel has been lost. It was a terrible attempt to put this book on the screen. I sincerely hope that the sometimes intelligent, good director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will make another attempt to put this book on the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared with boring, fake and cheap arts, which has no reason and has no effect on its audience.
