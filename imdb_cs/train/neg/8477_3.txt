Personally, I hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical and the whole thought was a reflection of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a little girl who gets to where he does not belong. She hates her whole place, and to make her worse, she's a hot man who does not seem to like her (well, that damn school can not stand). Wonderfully finds a way to get in and get everyone to enjoy her plus, she gets a guy who falls in love with her. Then comes the choice where you have to choose between a colleague and a hockey player. He chooses hockey, then goes to beauticians and gets to the Olympic team. No real surprise. This entire movie was so damn predictable. You knew what was going to happen before you even saw them. It was so terrible that I almost jumped, and when I watched him perfectly, I had a terrible headache and an urge to shoot that I was watching such crap. Do not look at it if you are not at the age of ten or in fact as fragile tween movies.
