Major Payne was not really good at all. Despite being humorous, the story was ridiculous, and the behavior was bad. Major Payne's voice and temperament were especially annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things the boys had to do in this movie were even more ridiculous. I would not want to make this film to anyone.
