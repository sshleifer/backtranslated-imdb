I did not see it and I do not intend to see this movie or any other one that includes Lindsay ...... if and until the "poor little rich girl" straightens her life for 2 years from the oldest recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> I do not really know any of those who have seen one of Lindsay's latest films. I would like to imagine that 2007 will be a high water mark in a career making film until it starts cleaning up. All the recent publicity has limited her career if she has further efforts for other films <br/> <br/> Until that time, filmmakers have actively sought Lindsay for their role in their upcoming production. Lindsay will probably have to go bankrupt and really compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "poisonous" and may well have a negative impact on the sale of tickets to any movie she's in. Sooooo .... now Lindsay will have to deal with "I will not want" ..... will she be able to handle it? I wonder if even Jay Leno will want Lindsay to come back to the TV show? <br /> <br /> All of the above are just my DETERMINATION. I have no inside information.
