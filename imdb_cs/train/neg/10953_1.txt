This apologetic excuse for television is one of the richest pieces of garbage ever hit by Australian television. Housewives are bored, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent, and are selected on the grounds that you would probably have attempted to kill them if you were to live with them. As for me, the big brother is the decline of Western society, showing us as a society on a steep slope to become dead dead. What happened to a television that was not aimed at the smallest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be considered entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian, and as he moved to Channel 10, he became terribly unhappy. Except The Simpsons, which is highly intelligent.
