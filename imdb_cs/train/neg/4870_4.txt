The film is bad. Nothing special - just a "kid" movie without a serious thing in it. But there is one reason to look at it: animal speech. Some of them are so entertaining in what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a pound sack saying "I'm Keyser Soze" or another animal called "You're a dead cat walking" or many other funny inserts, see it. Because there is no other good film about it. Vote: 4 out of 10.
