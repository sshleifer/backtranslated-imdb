This movie was terrible in the worst way: he just did not care. It did not matter what happened in the conspiracy; you did not care about the characters. Everyone was heartless. Eventually I ended up about 45 minutes because I just did not want to have to put my mind to it. There's too much sex in the movie. Sex can be fine; he can even make a movie (Karma Sutra), but sex was not beautiful or sexy here. It was just ugly. You do not see this movie.
