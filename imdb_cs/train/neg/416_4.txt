(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it would end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. Very good business, director like Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every prerequisite for a great movie has been completed. Unfortunately, these things do not really matter. The film was very weekly, stress free and very predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a group of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After successful animal testing Kevin Bacon decided to test himself. Once invisible, it changes completely and realizes the benefits that are not visible. From this, the murder is a very thin line. Hollow Man is a bad movie. He suffers from a disease that has many new movies: special effects. From a demanding theme that could lead producers to a great tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven breaks down everything that focuses only on special effects without damning the true value of the film. I have to admit that fx are amazing, probably the best I've ever seen from the Matrix, but that's not enough to make the movie good. In fact, it's a problem with movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors only care about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. There are very few exceptions, and Matrix is ​​probably the only film that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plotting. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. The place of the great movie is HM cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you could look at this movie: 1. Special effects 2. Joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I do not have the moment to freeze ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, what happened to the movie? All. Let's see what I remember. <br /> <br /> --- Not at all tense. It was supposed to be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. From the beginning, you know who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - Very much cliché. <br /> <br /> --- Of course the evil one wakes up several times before he dies. <br /> <br /> As with any low-quality horror, the first rule is to leave the characters as separate as possible. Every time someone is alone in the lab, the perfect sacrifice for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the conspiracy. Example: In the beginning, Bacon must scan his finger and enter the lab. When he's invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- End: absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> - After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls into the ground. Then Shue and Brolin are leaving quietly and slowly without looking back. It is normal? Then Bacon returns, attacks them and kills him again. And then Shue cries "I heard the blast" (it happened a few minutes ago) and suddenly they got inside. Have you ever heard the blast? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come, Mr. Verhoeven, I've been waiting for you much more! <br /> <br /> That's probably Hollow Man. What had to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Voting: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
