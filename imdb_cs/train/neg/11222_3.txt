Cybil Richards directs another masterpiece of Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in a somewhat exciting silver outfit) tries to destroy all the evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tape and she likes them. The sex scenes are well shot and set to an excellent soundtrack (at least for this kind of movie). Castings are to a large extent terrible and, above all, very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her extraordinarily attractive self and between looking at sexual ensembles that can expose her chest and drop a little. She also fits into a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks great naked, but in reality she is much more attractive in her silver dress, telling "drama." Amazing waste with Lovell and soundtrack is the only true redemption. Both average and Surrender output and clearly new budget low for them as well.
