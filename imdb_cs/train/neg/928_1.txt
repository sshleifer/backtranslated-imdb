This movie is so terrible that it's hard to find the right word for its description! <br /> <br /> At first, the story is so ridiculous. A lonely person can write a better story! The actors are boring and uninteresting, maybe they were forced to play in this cheated film. The reception of the National Forest in Cameras is the only time in this film. I would like to feel asham because I paid for this miserable picture. Let's hope no one makes a sequel or similar movie with a worse story :-)
