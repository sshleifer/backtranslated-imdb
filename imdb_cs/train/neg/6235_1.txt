All right, Al Gore! You have become the first person to make 1 billion dollars of global warming lager! Like all the other people who made fables in the world, this is the place with the best lies that suck so many people. Certain pollution is not a good thing and I would like the entire tree to continue to grow, but global warming is a business! It uses thousands of people who are all very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are just so many things that just do not add, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but they went to get a lot of money in the world. What's next? Is Santa Real?
