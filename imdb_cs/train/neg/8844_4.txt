I watched this film after seeing other IMDb comments and even convinced my wife that it was a "unique horror film". I wanted to like this movie, but she was not able to. "The Love Story" was good, but the horror was very bad. If the story was only about a young man who fell in love with a girl who suffered parasomni, then it would be a better film. The care center has gone beyond the borders, in fact, it was quite ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores privacy and professionalism laws. The nurse walks into the room for the routine administration of a dangerous patient (without a security escort) and falls into the tank and runs out of the room that yells for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the villain of the film) is bound in a standing position fully dressed - probably years? None of this makes sense. The movie even had some actors I liked about other things like detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
