Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays modern criminality of a teenage girl who is trying to resolve the brutal killing of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which is not particularly well done, but is surprisingly serious in terms of its leadership. Silverstone is appealing and successful in removing an interesting young woman, even though the cheesy picture undermines. Support for cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, though violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheese camp, but not exceptionally unforgettable. * 1/2 from ****
