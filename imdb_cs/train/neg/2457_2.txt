Some people do not like the animation. Personally, I think animation was quite remarkable when this movie was done. There are a lot of older cartoons I like. My problems with this movie are not animations, but basically it was the way it was created. The characters are all ... well, fuckin '. And for this film they should not be. It seems that everyone in the LOTR has a key problem (to start with). The only way they worked was that I was upset. My two sisters and I laughed for most of this movie. I think if many people saw it than they would see the new ones, they would not be gone. I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it. There are several movies that give me headaches. That was one of them. But it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, even though it's up there. Or down there, in your opinion.
