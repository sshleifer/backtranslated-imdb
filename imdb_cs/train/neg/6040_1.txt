Where to start, this movie started wrong and ended up wrong! It consists of extremely bad acting and unrealistic effects that have attracted me to my seat, seriously, my cat could act better than this one. Some of them were really ridiculous, because it was so incredible, they would have rated it lower, but they had nothing else! So, beware of warnings, and if you are so bored that you are approaching suicide and want a good reason to continue your suicide mission, do not worry about this. I'm still in shock that it could really be made available to the public, it should be a crime, and all those involved should be arrested. I gathered that you got your pedestal, so I'll let you decide.
