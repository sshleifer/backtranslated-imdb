While this idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, execution is as it usually is lacking. While the practical Mummy effects are not bad and the "Gun Nut" is over the worst jingle, the only real draw is to see Moreno Baccarin and Adam Baldwin again on a small screen. I suspect it was an idea all the time. They do the best they have but "have to see" the moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character brought some Tomb Raider stylish shorts. I'm not a tall cinema, but you can not deny the real beauty when you see it! And Adam Baldwin speaks again like a person you love to hate. If you just want to look at a few of your favorite Firefly characters, you have a good time with some subclass material, then it could be for you. If you want to have good acting and characters, we recommend you look elsewhere.
