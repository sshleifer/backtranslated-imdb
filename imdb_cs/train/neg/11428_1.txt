Oh my God .. THE BEST WHEN YOU ARE ALL - this is the main idea that came into my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Although perhaps the thought was good, but the effect was miserable. I mean, in particular, the role of H. Graham. What it was??? In my view, they destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was played in a hurt and unpleasant way. Each time she appears she reminds you that you are watching the movie and destroying the moment of the moment, then the whole movie, because most of the time you see is her silly faces with stupid attempts to create emotions. TERRIBLE, do not waste time.
