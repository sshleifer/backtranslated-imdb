As a girl, Hinako moved from a small village to Tokyo and left her two best friends, Fumiyu and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised when she finds out that Sayori has died when she was a teenager. She reconnected with Fumiyah and they are horrified when they find out that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected over the island of Shikoku. Oh no. I chased this because I like Asian horror, and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a handsome actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This movie is silly, boring, poorly filmed, non-imaginative, and mostly unnecessary. Kuriyama has a minimum time on the screen as a resurrected Sayori and her character has little work.
