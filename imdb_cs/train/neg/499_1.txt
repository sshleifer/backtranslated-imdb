The horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft pornographic Gothic flick every night from 10 am to 4 am, but their "fear" factor is very limited, if at all. In fact, I'm sure I believe that more lottery lottery wins more than what the channel offers. Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves a special mention because I feel uncontested the low channel full of the lowest. I can not even begin to say how bad this movie is, but in order to finish the minimum ten lines required by this page I will at least publish it. <br /> <br /> First, the name is misleading and has no resemblance to the on-screen action. In fact, the film could well be called the "Toothbrush" or "Wallpaper" for everything it has to do with the story. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpapers. There are no bloodshed for miles, and even worse, not one. I'm sure two different films are made here by mistake. A more appropriate title would be: "The Upper Italian Count brings five people to a terrible castle and spoils us stupidly for nine minutes." Yes, that's better. The game is awful and the dubbing is awesome, and the guy playing Seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character ... grumpy. /> <br /> The only economical grace of this film is a small, but slightly interesting, lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sexual scenes and an added attraction that every female figure gets its set. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you would not notice this. No vampires, no dances, no scene of brutal or spooky nature, and no way of God's land, sometimes I ever look at this. <br /> <br /> There is no word about lies, this movie could give you off movies for life.
