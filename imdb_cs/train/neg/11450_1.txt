I have to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to adjust it before it looks on August 3rd. Andy Samberg plays from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town that wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we meet him, he jumps by the post truck on the mo-ped, yes, mo-ped, and almost does. That would be worthy of "Jackass" movie if he did not. Isla Fisher plays a slightly older and more mature girl next door to Denise. It looks like Rod is enough to join his "crew". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother Kevin, who documents cameras with a camera. Sissy Spacek plays Mother's Birth, Mary. She married again with Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough guy who has fun with Rod in some real turn. It is clear that Rod will not gain Franco's respect until he can beat him. We've found that Frank needs $ 50,000. cardiac transplantation, and Rod is determined to raise money so that he can "beat his butt" as soon as he heals and proves to be a man. A long fall on the mountain side convinces Rod to "go big" on a stuntman. Rod is about to get money by being charged for doing bits that would hurt you if you saw them in real life. Just like a human torch - to celebrate birthday for children. There were those who laughed at most of the pieces. Just when all hope and money is lost, there comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. Gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get gifts. Rod gets a new suit and a real motorcycle. The entire city is showing up and the world is guessing. Will you jump? Will she get a girl? Increase $ 50k? Does Frank get his butt beaten by Rod? Wait for a 90-minute movie to appear on the video.
