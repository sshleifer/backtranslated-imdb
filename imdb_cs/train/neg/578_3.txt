It's not a good movie. The game is remarkably stiff and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know if a real horrible approach is going to be, or a camp and a kiosk will go down. I have never seen the first movie, but it does not become a self-interest, there are several unconvincing plotings, and the viewer never realizes the importance of the leading female vampire. Not worth the attention
