Well, by simply reading the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well, but after the first half hour it became so boring. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> She tells a story about her mother, who is so desperate that her daughter becomes a cheerleader that she will go any distance to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl. She always wins the competition, and so pushes her mother to her "exclusion". After a conversation with a hitman, her mother decides that the girl must be a little overwhelmed. So actions are accepted, but eventually caught. <br /> <br /> The cast is horrible and the movie stretches too long when nothing happens. Do not waste your time by watching this situation. <br /> <br />
