Once he was a sci-fi author named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classical book called "Little Fuzzy," which concerned a man who discovered a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to waste his grave before his corpse collapsed. This is the book where they got an idea for the Ewoka. <br /> <br /> The skull is so spectacular ripoff "Little Fuzzy" Can I wonder why I'm the only one who noticed? <br /> <br /> But do not take a word for it. Here is a link to the Guntenberg project where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" free of charge: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
