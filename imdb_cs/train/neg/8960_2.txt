the only thing that often appears in my head when I'm writing this review is that I will never be back for half an hour! to hint that I'm not just blowing air, I'll compare the movie to other cubicle trilogy films (cube and hypercube)! The cube was not great, but it was original and it formed for some technical defects! hypercube as a sequel has lost the edge of originality, but it turned out to look quite sharp and even liked beter than cube (the story was better)! but cube zero compared to its predecessors really is not worth sh * t! complete lack of good fx, very f * ck * d up script and simply old bad acting do not combine well! for example: I thought during the entire movie it would be incredibly stupid if ... had happened and then it would happen so it is not even original! my advice: do not lose the hour and a half I lost !!!!!!!! and I hope this movie will collapse and burn !!!!!!!
