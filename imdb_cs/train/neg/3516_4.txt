There is no doubt about the cadet training in the film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who keeps military discipline in creating a new kind of soldier from his cadets - the bombs. But he is not so strong that he is unfair or hostile. In fact, she even changes her mind on the value of women working in the army. It is difficult to be, but at other times it is a clear combination of coach and pastor, a role he has perfected in other films. Its character is the basis of an event around which everything is spinning. O'Brien looks naturally in a role and plays great. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and impressive special effects ending.
