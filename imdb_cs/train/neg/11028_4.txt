Not far from the beginning, after John Dillinger (Warren Oates) was extraordinary, is an egomaniac rapist, another 20th-century bandit is shrouded in a farm and surrounded by the FBI. Second Commander Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), detects the situation, keeps a cigar lit in his mouth, picks up two charged 45-inch automats and heads off to the remote house itself. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis came out of the house, carrying a female hostage, a wise man. If you are enchanted by stories like the Red Riding Hood, it should have a lot of interest. Oh, it's just as exciting as the soulless. Nice boy Floyd is dramatically meeting his extinction. More violation of the Civil Code. Lots of Tommy weapons and guns. Whole blood. <br /> <br /> As a history, it was a piss. Few remembers that Melvin Purvis is like the FBI hero, I would have thought he was named. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the search for the public. The picture was written and directed by John Milius. It is the man who wrote it in his contract that if some animals were shot and killed during one of his productions, he should be a designated shooter. Milius is the guy, the total sinister angry who had the Teddy Roosevelt shouts from Henry V in "The Day of St. Crispin" in the Spanish-American War and all that. Exciting, yes, and complete rubbish. "I knew I would never survive him, and I did not really try too much." That's it, kill them all and get them done. <br /> <br /> You'll just love it.
