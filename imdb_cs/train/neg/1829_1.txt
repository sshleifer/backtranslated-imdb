Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not build Ben Stiller anymore. How can this man always make movies is behind me. I do not understand how this happens if I worked at work as she behaves in a movie that would throw me, and I own a company ..... I had to shoot myself. GOD! This film was just a simple, searing, smelly pile of POO that should be used if possible. Still something I have to say in the commentary on 10 lines of text is idiotic. What is wrong when you say a few things about the movie? I never understand why pages will require a short novel written, when sometimes a brief note is all that is necessary.
