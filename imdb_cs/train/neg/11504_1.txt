AKA: Monday in the Sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just watched. The three men aimlessly go and drink, horrified about everything and everyone on their way. That's a drama, but what it is is a complete loss of film without a single redemption. I've read reviews that mention performances here as "gorgeous," "beautiful," and "heroic". I'm afraid I can not agree unless these men should look like the stupid most ignorant proto-people who ever walked. Everyone in all? It was not a movie. He walks through all and loses everyone, except the audience. I've been looking at it three times, and I can not see what somebody sees in this garbage. There is nothing deep here. It's bullshit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
