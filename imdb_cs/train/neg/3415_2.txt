In a standard view, it's just a terrible movie. But it does almost perfect score on an unintentional comedy scale. I can think of some real comedies that make me laugh as I watched this movie.

I do not want to waste the gas or energy you drive into the department store to rent it, but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3am and coming to TV, check it out.
