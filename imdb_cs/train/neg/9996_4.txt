Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are some improvement, "Airport '77" is not much better than "1975 Airport": Smooth, commercial garbage immersed (this time literally) decent cast. Jack Lemmon is a pilot full of aircraft, who has kidnapped art thieves and came into the sea (all advertising claimed to be near the Bermuda triangle, but he does not even mention the film itself). When the rescue boats lift the plane out of the water, we see that all of their cranes drop (somewhat blindly) into the ocean and are hard to laugh (imagine cranes fitting in the plane, the passenger and the flooded script). NBC was accustomed to the air, which seemed to be a "directorial cut," while at least one hour of extra shot - mostly flashbacks - came into action with all the finesse of the "Gilligan's Island" episode. The most exciting moment is the air crash and some players have a bit of fun: Lee Grant is unpleasant drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a non-senseless flight attendant, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting old men. Yet personal conflicts and unbearable military details eventually break into patience. ** z ****
