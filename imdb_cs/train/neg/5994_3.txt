Ok .. this movie could be so good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and loved it and this movie has some features that could be found in the good thunderbirds movie. The vessel itself and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while we still kept the patterns we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, while Lady P and Bill Paxton, though not exactly what I meant by Jeff Tracey, were pretty solid ... but then the adults were excluded from the equation and we were asked to believe the 8-year-old could fly 200 tons. <br /> <br /> It's not so that the movie was centered around the kids that I felt like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so uncomfortable in the movie and seemed to be able to fly machines just like his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some damn simple machines that are used if it is. The film apparently did not know if he wanted to be serious or fake. She tried to make a reminder, and that usually flattened. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
