Five minutes into this movie you realize you've seen it before. It is BOILER ROOM. It's a FIRM. And he's the DEVILS DEBATE. And there are no new elements here. Except for the ubiquitous Bill Gates-allegory. Conservatives are always good things to create movies, but why should they be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie because - at least for a while - it seems realistic. In the antitrust, everything is bad. How realistic is, for example, that your boss paid a fraudster for his girlfriend to make you work better and control you? I would put 1, but the soundtrack is fine, so 2/10.
