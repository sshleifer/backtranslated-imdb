Okay, I have to say before unveiling the "monster." to say that it really does not fit into this category, just a strange thing that had annoying screaming! And personally, I think grandmother could escape from the thing, but anyway. Actually, I got into this movie, although the main character was drunk and the addictive hero did not come as a recall. But such scenes as when he runs off the train and you can see that the character at the door is a little scary, even where the guard was just killed and the "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the catastrophe gets stuck when the monster appears that it has just become your average horror, with limited excitement or fear. I was slowly bored and wanted to turn it off. I'm glad that most people said it was for homeless people to do it, especially the guy, gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could really be something special, instead of happening now that every other horror! Only boring and unforgettable money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a left fright here and there or a gore fest (which is limited, almost none in fact) in any case, do it go but all serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better movies out there .
