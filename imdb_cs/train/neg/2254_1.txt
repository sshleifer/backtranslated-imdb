Okay, people, honestly ... it must be one of the worst biz movies ever made, but I laugh stupidly (which may be the reason I enjoyed it). Basically it's all about sex, sex and how to get your personal 15 minutes of glory. Did I mention that sex is the main theme in this movie? If you have a thing that suits for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you have a chance (and you have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Look at spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie was the one who asked Jerry about whether he could marry a goat (!) On a show and flash the wallet with his love pictures. Triple A for bad taste and fun!
