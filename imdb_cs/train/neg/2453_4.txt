I could have given this movie a higher rating before the Peter Jackson Jackson trilogy came out, but when they saw two of them next to each other, there was simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is submerged, many important scenes from the book are omitted, and there is little character development. Animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that have been painted, which I thought was distracting. And the most disappointed thing about this movie is that it falls apart in the middle of the story and has never been completed. There are some good points - battle scenes are exciting to be observed, and dialogue follows the book into a letter. Watch this if you have a rush and you can not spend 10 hours watching a new trilogy. But if you have not read a book, you are likely to be confused because of this version is missing a lot. 4 of 10.
