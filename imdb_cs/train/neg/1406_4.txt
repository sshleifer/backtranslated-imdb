This "movie" is rather a music video. Kusturica, in a 2004 interview, said that when he was making films, he felt like doing music, and when he was making music, he felt like filming movies. The best thing about "Promise Me" is the music written by Stribor Kusturica. In the same interview, Kusturica said that dialogues in movies are like noise. "Promise to me" has little "noise". I liked "Life is a miracle". It was like a music video for the first 30 minutes and sometimes later, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promise to me" has no conspiracy. I was waiting for this film with great expectations because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters who also contributed to "Life is a Miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturici they are "noisy" and to my regret I saw only two dialogues that I could identify as Ranko Bozic wrote. The second part of the script was used by a director to produce a chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the "Gypsies Time" and "Black Cat White Cat" scenarios) said in an interview that Kusturica never watched the screenplay. The "Black Cat White Cat" was the only script for which Kusturica said he would not touch her. According to Gordan Mihica, Kusturica will return to the script, and if he does not do a good movie. And I think this is the case with a "promise to me". He had to watch the screenplay of Ranko Bozic. "" Promise to me "is billed as" comedy, "but there are only a few moments that make me laugh, comedy moments are in the same style as" black cat white cat ", but they are not funny at all, I think the difference comes from it that "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic, but I know some people who liked it, "Promise Me," consider it a very positive film.
