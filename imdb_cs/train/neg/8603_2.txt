It could be a fun movie, but instead fits with other fools like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematographic food chain. If they played this film on their faces, it could be a very funny movie like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it on the tongue in his face but more often than not. <br /> <br /> This movie is a small community besieging mutant slugs. Near the sewer is an abandoned toxic waste landfill that mutates slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - even monsters that move slowly and may be crouching under your shoe. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only ones who seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and the mayor think they are crazy. The culmination is a turbulent revolt - in this case unintentional - which causes you to scratch your head as stupid (actors and screenwriters) is the scenario of destroying slugs. STORY: $$ (No new reason Simon appears to play gore elements in speech, but dialogue is straightforward. If Simon worked with a clever script - one with a number of disposable and eccentric figures, it could be a spherical film). </ li> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and you will get corpses of people who have been cleansed with slugs and lots of mysterious scenes.) ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael seems Garfield knows that this scenario is stinking and he brings his lines to expression the face that suggests she knows how ridiculous this film is, she is, Kim Terry, as his wife, performs a reasonable job, even though she does little beyond the borders, "Teenagers" were all heroic actors - without exception. use the Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers get nasty to bed before they get - in the wrong scene - with a horde of slugs, climbing into the girl's bedroom, there's a man and a woman nudity).
