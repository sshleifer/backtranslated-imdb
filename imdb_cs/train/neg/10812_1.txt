What a wretched movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to comment very much. I'm still trying to return the few hours I have left. <br /> <br /> Let me just let it - Shaq has NEVER BUSINESS being an actor or singer. He is completely without talent on both discs. It's a pity that a lot more talented people spend in community theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to get into the movies and cut out CDs. A large part of this failed film was a sad non-talent that is Shaq.
