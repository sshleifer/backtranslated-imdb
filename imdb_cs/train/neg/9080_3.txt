Well, I just ordered it at my pay-per-view home because I was bored and needed laughter. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but I do not even remember where they are. I do not understand why this movie was created. She says it's a comedy, but seriously, I do not find penis singing or naked 70 year old woman very funny. This movie has tried to fit in the "rough" comedies of recent years, such as American pie and road trip, but it has disappointed. It was a way to look a lot, then it was a comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz make her name in this movie?!?! All I liked in this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and pleasant and well done. In addition, avoid this movie. 3/10
