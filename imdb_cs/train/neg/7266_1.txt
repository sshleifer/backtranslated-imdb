... and yet we were told there was still an hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why was there no editor to tell the writer / director, snip? The writer / director seems to have been making shorts before; as short, it would be okay. But the lack of dialogue begins to bloom in twenty minutes. Lack of many musical views. Noise in the background (talking, traffic and, above all, the ubiquitous helicopter) is really fast. But the worst failure is in the story. In a short while, it is precious. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost cried out on the screen: "We got it, we got it !!!!!" It's amazing that after we left the theater, we could go home, watch the daily show and part of the Colbert report, get ready for bed and know that the audience was still imprisoned in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to meet your vision. You need to give the audience enough to share your vision.
