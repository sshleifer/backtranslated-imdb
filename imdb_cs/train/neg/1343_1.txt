We bought this movie from a Poundland store. We were looking for more inspiration because we had previously bought the No Big Deal movie and rebuilt it. We expected this film to be badly inspiring to rebuild it and put it on the tube. However, it was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. Bad effects and scenario are not enough to watch it. The main body of a woman appears to be scratched in a timely manner to keep an interest in the viewer. However, just curious, do they blow the budget to get her to get her dress off? If so, I would ask for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the pictures do not match each other and the camera is so amateur that our remake of bad movies looks professional. I can not believe it is sold as a tradable product. <br /> <br /> It's just NOT FALLING and UGLY is looking. Actors are bad and there is no professional approach. There are no words that describe how terrible it is.
