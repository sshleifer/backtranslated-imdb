I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just recently finished watching the whole ST Voyager series on DVD, which may make this episode more disgusting because the differences in style and access between the two shows could not be sharper. The idea could have been good if it had been used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how VOY would probably be treated. They could represent memories that would be the "new" audience, rather than merely returning old clips. Inputs and outputs between "memories" and "presence" in this episode begin as a clich√© at the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern continues to carry on. Bar none - the worst episode ever.
