When this movie was released in 1997, "special effects" like them were bad. They should be dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no one who was involved in the production of this film was looking for Oscar. It's a wild go away from director Fred Olena Raya, most of whom have the word "Bikini" in the name (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from Lost Planet, etc.) And there's just a little more than T & A flicks. with films rated "U" and directed directly to children. You have to give him credit for diversification! It was a small cult hit directly-on-video, which later resulted in a couple of sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went downhill quickly after the 1982s ET) plays the "invisible mom" title of the film and returned to the sequel. Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been in a free fall even longer since the 1961s "West Side Story") plays the villainous Dr. Woortera. It is likely that most of the cast is at that time in their careers where they would be ready to work on almost anything but to pay bills a month - except maybe the young Trenton Knight as Josh It still says that although he worked before this film, this the child's actor did not work again after the sequel, "Invisible Mama 2" Maybe the movie was cursed. After all, he was not that bad in This film is good for a child actor - not better nor worse than any of his experienced stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the effects of "invisibility" are the least, the direction is wrong, the writing is obvious, and it is nothing that is written at home. There are a lot of things, but for someone younger than ten, this movie will undoubtedly be quite attentive. Most adults will probably want to do a scam of their own act when it's on it, and I would not even blame them!
