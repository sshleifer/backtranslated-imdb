this show is terrible. no comedy, no plot, no good characters. America is blind to make a prize for real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. I sincerely love to cancel this show. thank you CBS. keep two and a half men, keep Christine, adhere to the rules of engagement keeping up as I meet your mother who is really not funny but much more fun than this. this show is breaking away friends. with the same director, so it's okay. but keep this show away and never come back. never ever. The only reason why I did not make him 1 rating is that he keeps me awake instead of sleeping. these are the types of films or TV shows I give one. the only reason I was still awake was because of the audience laughing and I'm looking forward to the next show. I really want this show to be funny, but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I do not understand why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but I too Big Bang theory a little stupid. my bad smart. class would be bye now I have a smile and it's not from watching your show.
