Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> It also has a terrible dialogue, unconvincing characters and an absurd or rather non-existent story. It's just a kid from bad to worse in a cynical effort to clear up some sort of emotion from an inappropriate and uningaging hysterion-afest! A HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap frames can the movie take? The Hedgehog, by the way, gave the most convincing and observable performance in this nine-minute cringe-athon. If you were thinking about watching this movie, no. I'm sorry, but in this movie I can not find a single redemption. I record big, fat ZERO with me. Strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you like Dance in the Dark ... <br /> <br />
