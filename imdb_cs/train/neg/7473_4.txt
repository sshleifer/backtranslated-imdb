My husband and I have been interested in the theatrical performances - a powerful wartime southern lady with a disordered personal life, which deals with crimes for the LAPD. The first season was for us a television. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season were so boring and inappropriate for the strong nature that we stopped watching. My husband and I were disturbed by an episode from which her mother was trying to hide from her being stolen. But the controversial event was an episode where she concealed her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but she told her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do that? The answer is that it would not. Besides, my husband and I are choosing dirty with almost perfect precision. It's almost always a white man or a woman introduced to a mate on a murder scene or an idealized family. Script writers can not make something original from time to time? As I have already mentioned, we are no longer spectators. We prefer shows that do not harm characters and do not damage our intelligence.
