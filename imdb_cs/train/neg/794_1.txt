If you are no longer familiar with the star stars who play in this movie, save time and stop reading this review after you have reached the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> WAIT THE FILM ONLY AND WAIT THE FOLLOWING. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you will not be ready to scream. Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people who express different emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FROM SOME GOOD WORDS. We can see that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we simply DO NOT CRAP why, because there is no story. When the movie ends, you'll be tired and tired of those silly, harsh, girl's faces. You will be revolted when you have spent the whole of this time looking at how they smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, are "serious," and any other unnecessary expression that slashes on their faces. sometimes go so far as to refer to this piece of awkward waste as the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of doubt what a trailer and innumerable adoring comments on this page will not tell you: <br /> < br /> Only "convert", hopeless minions will love this movie, most of them are teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> If you are not one of these soulless "fans," stay hell of this abomination.
