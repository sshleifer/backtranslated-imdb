Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why they like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I tried to watch her more than once, and I can not do it all the episode. <br /> <br /> One thing is horrible. Everyone overcomes where it is unpleasant to watch. They speak in an unnatural voice, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. I've seen better acting at kindergarten. <br /> <br /> Another thing is not FUNNY. Land is boring. They are not creative, intelligent, or FUNNY. Should not the sitcom be fun? Why am I not laughing? After all, what is the seventy? It's about as authentic as the 1970s as "Happy Days" in the 1950s. Oh, and what's going on with Ashton Kutcher? Who took this dwarf dweeb? And now does the movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think it's a high-quality television, it worries me.
