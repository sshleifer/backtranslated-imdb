I did not like the movie, Joshua, at all. Maybe it's because I saw another, much better-liked film called Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's just because this movie was not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Sure, the story of an evil child is not entirely original, but that does not mean that the movie can not succeed. It could have been thrilling and fun and cool, but instead it was slow building, boring, insignificant, and really did not let me think of anything more than "It was not very good" when it was all. <br /> <br /> Finally, Joshua's motivation is revealed. I'm not going to do it, but the fact is that he did not meet his goals, because despite Vera Farmig as his mother, Abby, who disappears in the movie in the fourth quarter, all the arrows point to her return home. She was devoted to the mental institution because she lost her mind, but Joshua's father / husband was accused of manipulating his medication, which tells the audience that the institution realized she was really not mentally ill but rather medically dosed. So ... should not she be home soon? Will not Joshua fail? Will not his mother live with him and his sister, and perhaps his father early? I asked the Father because his future remained open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I did not care about the characters. The child evil demons Joshua was not frightening. The story moved slowly, and as it rose, it was still boring. The conclusion was still flat. When it was over, I could not believe I was sitting there. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the acting was good from parents, especially Vera Farmigy as mothers, but if you want to see the movie about the evil "baby," look at Orphan. Now it's a movie that got a non-original concept and created a great movie.
