When watching a movie, I'm not sure what the training is. There is a reason why a writer should not manage his job and not even act on it, you can not do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this movie because of the director wearing so many hats. Mrs. McTeer is a movie. Her wonderful talent also contributed to portraying this woman why I was betrothed. Here's a British actress who can do anything. In my view, the conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this film did not have that much. Everything was easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that would prevent the chakras from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for sweetness, but especially for Miss McTeer's great performance.
