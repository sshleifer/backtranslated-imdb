It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality came from the memories I had from a previous film that contrasted with "new" personalities (or their lack). I really thought the opening scene was Ariel's nightmare because it was absurd. It was serious. It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney Channel - they're all hyperactive, and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connected. The most disappointing was the horrible song - not catchy, not amazing. In the original Ariel he had a wonderful and powerful voice and all the songs are catchy and entertaining. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not creative in the slightest; it's as if they were talking in an unpleasant voice of singing - rather weak, disappointed. I do not have to want to sing - they felt like you would normally get out of Disney's movie. It's like no one wants to do this movie so they hardly tried. . . this movie will need a new story, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm, without being uncomfortable "look at me! look at me!" Disney's mentality.
