Chris Kattan is a great actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone unless he achieves some creative control. He plays an unpleasantly peppered character, basically based on a slow slow and speed. Do you want to know just those funny parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, its performance on me is fun. Nothing else. Especially when you can say he's trying hard to be a physical comic that he should not try because he's one. And yet, his "demolition office veterinarian" bit looks like furiously bad. This movie forced me to create an eyebrow. Avoid it at all costs and keep an eye on SNL.
