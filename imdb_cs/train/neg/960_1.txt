Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this film was just a break of the Japanese Ringu. Well, I think the US also made its version, but at least it was a completely new version. So, so sad. I really enjoy watching movies from Philippines, and they know that some great things can come from such a small country, so I can not believe it has to happen. Claudine and Kris are so big names, surprised to be connected with the plagiarist. Every philosophy that is filming movies in Filipino movies: You do not have to try to make money. There are many movie fans watching movies filmed by the Filipinos and enjoying them!
