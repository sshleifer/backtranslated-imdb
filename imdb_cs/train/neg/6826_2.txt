It's been a long time since I saw the movie so badly. The performance is very average, the story is terribly boring and I am losing words in terms of execution. It was completely non-original. Oh, and that's such a comedy as Clint Eastwood's pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the ones with the TV show - where the hell you?) did it right - casting 80% of what we noticed - forgotten actors. If they hoped the career revival would begin, then I think it should never be done in their life! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors, nor the director (who is an actor and apparently an actor) has pulled it down. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than any of the others. I apologize, but if you ever thought about it, I recommend that you turn to something less traumatic, not only a complete waste of time, but also a faint example of how bad movies look.
