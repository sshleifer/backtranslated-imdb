Since its release in 1983, "The Christmas Story", told by Jean Shepherd's narrative story of his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story", however, still has Shepherd as a narrator, but he has absolutely no charm and the characters are just around the caliber of the original film. "My Summer Story" is basically mishmash average and just not very interesting stories that include hillbilly neighbors and fights peaks. Charles Grodin, whom I usually like, is extremely unlike his father (Darren McGavin was more involved in the original) and his character never seems to be forced. Kiernan Culkin is a bad substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is forgotten here. It seems that only mom has a price and maybe it's because he's a bean manager of a cinema with a sauce when he pushes his luck over too long a housekeeper on a "free night bowl." Stories in this are mostly insignificant and stretched paper thin. It can appeal to extremely low-budget, but as a continuation of the "Christmas story", it is very poor and does not stand for most people. 2 out of 10.
