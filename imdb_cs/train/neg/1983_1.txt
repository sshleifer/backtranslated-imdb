Oh, add people to this movie for a break. All I liked was ......... I'm sorry, I'm still thinking. Jo jo !!!! When John Wayne came and fired the bad guys. Oh, I'm sorry, the bad movie, I was thinking about a better film. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend myself. Yeah yeah, the cat that was from Clueless was in it. Do not leave Stacy Dash. I think we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did dooooosie. Hey, one thing that has never been done in the West, even all the female cast, they really hung a woman from the gallows. That could be the first one in the West. Though her neck should have been broken, and she had survived the pain, you must make a little effort to the director to try west. I also never saw a lynched woman from a horse in some Western, although it did not happen in this movie, I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right now Ed Wood Monster Bride # 2 Maybe this is what the filmmakers are doing. Orginality, especially with all African women and oriental cowgirl. Heeey, if the Gang Of Roses creators want to do this sequel, you could have a slang like, "Hey, do not think of my home girls" and "talk to your hands, baby, talk to your hands." You might also have a second- commander of the Surfers type, who says things like, "That shooting was a RAD man." You know such things.
