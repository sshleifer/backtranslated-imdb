Someone called Howard Koch and Schlockmeister, but he wrote the script "Casablanca," right? Or not. Perhaps more than one Koch runs in Hollywood, and I do not like "Casablanca." Wait a minute - yes, there's Hollwyood next by Howard Koch. This is the one who wrote "Casablanca". It does not matter. I will pay too much attention to this commentary as "Howard W. Koch", who added to this production, which is very little. Do you know what that sounds like? Someone had read Cliff's notes on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided that there were no original thoughts on board Express Inbound Inspiration Express, updating it and hollywooding it with a happy ending. There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast estate between the three sisters, and before he does, he asks how much he loves. The two sisters fit to the feet and the brown nose to get the money. The third is a good girl, and she refuses to go to Lear. But in the play Lear remains alive when he regrets his decision to give his convectors his hideout and get rid of honorable girls. In the belly of the robbers, he cries crazy and naked, blossoming hair and hallucinations. Children can do it to you. (Take my boyfriend, for example, after all the effort that I have raised unnecessarily when I pick him up, has any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) No.) Finally, everyone in the game is dying. /> It's obvious in the movie that a good sister is annoyed and suicidal, but when she tries herself, someone jumps and rescues her, so the end is more or less happy. That's the difference between Hollywood and the real tragedy if you do not define Hollywood as a tragedy enough for yourself.
