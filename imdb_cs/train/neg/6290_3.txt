Recap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deep and love, and they are certainly perfect for themselves, even though they met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's legal brother, is not so happy. He is afraid that marriage is a threat to his fascinating work in a family business and he decides to hold Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron into a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel up. Commentary: It is supposed to be a continuation of a classic comedy, but it is not funny at all. This is mostly a pubertal show and a teenage excuses that show rather dressed women. In fact, it is almost impressive that you have many that you can put in there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the symptoms of a movie that can not be supported by itself. It just is not good enough. But it has three points of redemption, or three actors, which are worth a better scenario than this one. He is actor Josh Cooke, who has actually managed to create an impression of common sense. Sara Foster I know he has more talents than shooting such films and it seems that Emanuelle Vaugier has far more talents than this film. What is suspiciously missing is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are somewhat rare. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
