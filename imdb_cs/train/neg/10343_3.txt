The golden era of Disney animations dies until the late 1990s. This Quack Pack show should not even be considered DuckTales because the show has nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about teenage Huey, Dewey, and Louie, because they're making trouble for their uncle Donald and they're talking in hip-hop ling and they're completely dressed, unlike DuckTales. I prefer little adventurous nephews from DuckTales. In Duckburg, people and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repeated, the story is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of humor, I recommend it to you. If you want a better Disney show "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
