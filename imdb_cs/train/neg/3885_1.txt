This movie was not just bad - it was terrible. After watching it, I really felt I needed to take a shower to get dirty dirt. There running 'gag' with an older couple doing it, it's not funny, but that's disgusting. Monster makeup was cool, but that's all. Errors of continuity of course make you angry - at least I was. Cut is really bad. Almost anything else you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in "bad movies," it's exceptional in its obscurity, I could not even get her to laugh at it. You were warned.
