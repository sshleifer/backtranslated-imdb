Fabulous TV mini-series completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman who desperately tries to escape like a 16-year-old invention! No exaggeration - that's the real age of character Ali MacGraw when the film opens just before the surprise attack in Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and the one I am referring to whenever a theme occurs. <br /> <br /> This in itself makes this completely inconsistent, even though it is one of the world's best recorded "drama" of World War II. If you have a stomach - or a decent ability to fast forward - you can enjoy the late Robert Mitchuma in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I'm overwhelmed in some commentary on the love story. Did they see the film closed with their eyes? Or it's an aging boom that will never surprise me with its "selective memory" and "selective vision." I'm Boomer myself, so for a moment they did not think I was a hubristic young punk. 45 ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age is kind of damn. Winds of War could be ... so good. How much more would we talk about this mini-series today, about 25 years later, was that fact so important and decisive? Right now, with a constant embarrassment of old scattering, this in itself will eliminate most of the wonderful aspects of the wars of war.
