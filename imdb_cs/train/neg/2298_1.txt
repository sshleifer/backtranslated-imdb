Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons dubiously proclaimed "fairly good history" to predictions In his widely reported comments of the January 2 issue of the Christian Broadcasting Network, there is a 700 club during which he predicted that there would be " very serious terrorist attack "and" mass killing "in the United States in the" second half "of 2007, guest Pat Robertson boasted that he had" relatively good results "on earlier predictions. But the review of Robertson's New Year's 2006 predictions undermines this argumentation. He predicted, for example, that "President Bush will be strengthened." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The autumn elections will be incomplete, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The war in Iraq will reach a successful conclusion, we will begin to withdraw soldiers by the end of this year." WAY WRONG Furthermore, as reported in the Associated Press article of January 3, Robertson has in the past dubious predictions: The Broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily have won the re-election. Bush won 51% of the votes that fell and defeated Democratic senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would be victorious in the second semester. He said that proposals for the reform of the social security system will be approved BACK NEW! <br /> <br /> He says he's talking directly with God ... If he has such a sense of humor and watches Pat, he's crazy about himself again and again.
