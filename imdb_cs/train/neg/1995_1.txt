Well, I just paid the dollar for the DVD of this movie and it was not. It seems to come from a bad press and is in a public house, I guess. Neagle - despite its glory, awards and reputation - is a British British gallina that can not sing or dance or act. Some of the fine old Hollywood actors on the screen here had to think they were making classics. Director Herbert Wilcox (wife of Neagle) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was wrong. She was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. Her "serious" roles are even smarter than her musical appearance. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs are included and neither is well presented. Skip this one and find the one who plays Doris Day. At least you get real comedy and professional dance style!
