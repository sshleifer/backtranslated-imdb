No one should ever try to adapt Tom Robbins' book to the screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, a dialogue that works well in reading is bad when it comes to talking. Or, otherwise, nobody would suggest that hearing someone else's name is as seen in the pearl radium. Overall, the movie looks like poorly adapted cliffs Book Notes - Most of the parts were destroyed in the book at a fifth of their size when it comes to the story and the current story, and the end is wild (and uncomfortably) different from the end of the book. Most of the land from the book is lost, including those that do all that makes sense at the end, and there is more than one link that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Unfortunately, it is not a saving effort, unfortunately - the script should be read in comparison with the book, burned and all the actors were sent to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant enormously, but no one of his caliber could make a decent movie of such a complex book without miniseries.
