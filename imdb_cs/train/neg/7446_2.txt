I have two words for you. Sean Bean. In this film, the only valuable presence. Still, you do not see this movie. Even though he is good as a major villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and in fact I really did not care about the lovers of the stars crossing or dying. The film did not interest me, DO NOT make sure that these people were taking care of themselves. I have read a lot of "classic" novels after seeing movies and this movie did not even want me to read a book. The story looks so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doon. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and was much better. Look at Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great novels, such as Pride and Prejudice. Or the miniseries like Forsyte Saga. Look at them and do not bother Lorny Doone.
