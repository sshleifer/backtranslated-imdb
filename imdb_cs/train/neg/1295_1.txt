that's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese films, and I think the next film of the same director, the 80,000 krek electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - asano is a wonderful actor and the story was extremely tempting. but I could not find anything that would have fun. The movie takes forever to make nothing happen. and the effects that the director used - such as constant percussion and disproportionate use of slow motion - only contributed to my growing insanity that the plot was so wise and the actors were angry over. a lot of boredom was the result of foreign supplements that were totally unnecessary - like an hour spent on the asano that dragged around the slicing of Buddha statues and declared she was not listening to anything. this did not bring anything. my fellow Japanese film fan and I both checked the time constantly. we can not believe this movie was as awful as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for doing it, but unfortunately I was wrong.
