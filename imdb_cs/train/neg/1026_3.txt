Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors who have such a pivotal role, and that's so bad. Justin Timberlake is perhaps one of the worst actor who landed in a movie with staring power and money for Edison's acting role. His acting was PAINFUL to watch. The story was all right and all the other characters were acting actors, hell, even LL Cool J was ok because he had lots of little pieces that made his teeth. As the director and film company figured out that Timberlake was ready for this role, there was no way to understand it. His character spoils the whole experience because every time he's on the screen you're really rooted for the damaged cops to cover his apologies for his ass and he should be a hero ... I would not want to spend this money in a theater or a video. You HAVE, if you have HBO and you have nothing to do on Saturday night at 2 o'clock and you are drunk and stoned, it may be all right. Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching the human 'Kermit Frog' in the Hollywood blockade, it just did not work at all.
