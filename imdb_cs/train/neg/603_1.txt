Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and the conspiracy is so badly explored, it's ridiculous. No one should be terrorized at the London Underground. In the short run, there is no night in the service, there are maintenance workers who control the runways, make repairs, etc. The fact that homeless people live there is equally unlikely. Or that it is even possible to lock and you do not have access to a mobile phone today ... <br /> <br /> The worst what's likely to happen if someone finds out after the last train that they can get graffiti sprays on them. Although this has come under control due to the huge number of security cameras in the network, another thorn on the side of the story. (Remember that in London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) If it was set in a city that I was not familiar with, maybe I could enjoy it because of ignorance, but it's not a high quality movie, so I just could not bring myself to suspend my distrust and try to enjoy it for the banal little story that is. <br /> <br /> I would give him 0/10 if there is such a rating! Perhaps the most disappointed film I've ever thought I would want.
