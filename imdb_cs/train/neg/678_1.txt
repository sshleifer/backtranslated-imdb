All I can really say is that I'm glad that when watching a movie I'm knit socks or I'd be very angry that I lost 2 hours of my life. The game was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes to be serious that my husband and I laughed loudly. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
