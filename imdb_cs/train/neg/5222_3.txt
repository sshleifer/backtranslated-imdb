This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story that combines different things that make no sense. I find this a bad experiment. Second, actors can not play in a realistic way. They can not even talk about an actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what am I supposed to do now?
