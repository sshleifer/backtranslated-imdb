You may be tempted to rent the movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. It's one of the most bizarre movies ever shot. I was still waiting for something fun, but there's nothing fun in this movie. Even the film industry realized it was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. Its a wonder it was sometimes on the video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract Sellers made in this movie. I also wonder why the people who are responsible for this film can continue shooting other bad movies. This film is surely a waste of the money that has been used to create it, and the loss of time someone watches. Certainly there are high school students who will be able to write / produce a film that is a conspiracy.
