When I grew up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what Gilley used to be, I can tell you that this film is nausea. Most texas do not live as this film suggests. The conspiracy is weak and false accents are fun and strengthens the stereotypical picture that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin, reddish. Terribly fake Texas accents are what kills me. The truth is, most texas accents are in Texas, but these people are exaggerating. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Texas accents. It simply does not work. John Travolta should be a disco-dancer or 50's. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl than she was like a Texan.
