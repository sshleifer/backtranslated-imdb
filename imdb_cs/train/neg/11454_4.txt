So I have a low expectation that this movie will start, but it was not even possible. while there were some funny parts, even one or two laughing loud parts, this movie fell terribly short what I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast, so we were sitting there "WTF just happened?" and there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on. the part where it fell over the mountain was yawning. editing was really missing. there were some bad scenes transitions, but it seems to be a style these days. It made me laugh, but I would not see her again, and I'm glad I waited when it comes to hiring. give him a chance, you can enjoy it, but do not think you're for someone in front of a 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
