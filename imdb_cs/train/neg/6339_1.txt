All the films of David Prior are horrible in all respects: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually occupied as a male leader). But they all have an incredible value of fun because of their unintentional gaiety. Because almost every David Prior movie (as I like) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War waste, such as Red Dawn, the films of Prior are really funny because of their supernatural spaces and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was the other bastard?) Called by General Mitchell for a secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is delivered, which means "it's my roommate, I've trained him well". WHAT. Did you train your roommate? And apparently it will be their solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you find these gems on a video used anywhere, BUY them. They are all entertaining and even entertaining after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a real MST3K style experience. Meanwhile, my friends and I managed to get Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most is the ultimate remediation, with obvious Robert Z'dar.
