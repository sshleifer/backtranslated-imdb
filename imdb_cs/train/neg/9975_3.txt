I remember watching this movie several times as a very young child and there were some parts (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I once saw it as an adult, and then I understood the parts. The only problem I could think of as an adult was that it was not fun at all. So what is the movie? Is it a "children's movie"? Barely. Contains language and items that are not suitable for children. Is it hyperbole about what parents feel like they are walking with their children? Maybe, but why would not she focus on John Ritter instead of Junior? When the film plays the lead role of a seven-year-old man to take good care of the audience, it should be a movie for seven and under the crowd, otherwise people older than that would have no relationship (even 8 young people would not want to see a movie about a child a year younger than her). I'm pretty sure this movie did not do well in the box office and the reason is that he could not find anything on the market.
