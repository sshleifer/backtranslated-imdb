I first saw it when I was about 7. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what had happened. It seems like I was remembered 15 years later with great precision because it seems that writers have never been able to overcome the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon character. There is no character development, no story, no arc, nothing. Good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys do things just because they're bad. One inadvertently cheerful part is when someone who thinks it is important dies and nobody has known it. They just shrug their shoulders and continue on. There is hardly any dialogue. If you are carving combat scenes and running scenes, you will lose 70% of the movie. Watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason. Or, if you want to look at a rather clad hot cartoon chickens (or rather a clad hot cartoon bagpipe).
