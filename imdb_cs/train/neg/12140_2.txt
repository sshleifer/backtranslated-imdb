Mimicking his long title film finds ways to approach the 90 'mark. Beautiful sets are here and everything that makes Hamer's production values ​​a trademark, though Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there is nothing unexpected and nothing that would cost more than 5% of your attention. Overhead is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage of the game, actors are mostly stiff like wax figures (ok it's a Hamer feature, it's sometimes better in the pack). My conclusion: this movie is waste, it is not worth the time I spend the evening. Eternal life is a boring affair, and I had hoped that the guys responsible for programming in Cinemathèque would know better.
