My Take: Tired Christmas Comedy. The laughs are tired and the talent behind them seems too much. <br /> <br /> I love holidays as well as other guys (although I often have a bad case of blues), but it seems to me just a dumb spot for a lot of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on some day of the year, but it does not cause any pain during the season. Like we already have enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (still counting three and a * gulp), who wants to see a movie about their brother? In a plot that would be home with the Disney franchise SANTA CLAUSE (except occasional humor and Santa is a "little" assistant to wear a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke assume that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where is it from? <br /> <br /> It's really shame. FRED CLAUS is a blessed cast that could be a nice Christmas comedy that is likely to dissipate with the snow but would be much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are convinced that he is a long-lost brother of an aging Santa (Paul Giamatti) who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and even worse, the efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to closely watch Daughter of Christmas and his This is approaching being closed. Cha! And guess who plays Santa mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! They do not know if I want to free the casting or throw it away. Here we have some familiar faces that give us a good touch, but too little is done. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best thing FRED CLAUS might have is Santa's brother is his exact opposite and some joke about DJ Elf. I have to admit that I had a few giggles when Fred attended a celebrity brothers' group counseling (where Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone joined him), but giggling begins and ends. Even worse, the film is even subject to sentiment to "feel good" and teaches us a lesson about "what Christmas actually means." It seems that what Christmas means in Hollywood gets as much of our remaining Christmas money as they can. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of 5.
