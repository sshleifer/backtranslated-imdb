I'm completely confused why he even liked this film, let alone such a big deal, especially so many critics who are otherwise quite reasonable. There is one keyword that describes the movie to the kernel - irritating. The simplest explanation is that the director uses - or rather - exploits music. In the first half there is actually a really dull reggae melody about three times (when it's too often). But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually at the top. Godsakes, whether you liked a song or not, in the end, you will be terribly bad. Just think, some people say they've seen this movie four or five times. That means you've been listening to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... All that unnecessary hyper-repetition (that does not contribute anything to the story) could be justified if the rest of the movie had some lasting merit or if the story was somehow by engaging. But it is not. The only aspect I found appealing was Bridgette Lin charging around and still playing in Asia The Invincible in the raincoat and the sun. And this has been lost quite quickly. I'm sure this unforgettable high reputation of this film convinces many poor people to go and see it. I can only warn you - if you've never seen HK before, do not start with this. <br /> <br /> If you feel forced to watch it, avoid at all costs in the cinema. The fast forward and off buttons are vital survival tools. <br /> <br /> You were warned!
