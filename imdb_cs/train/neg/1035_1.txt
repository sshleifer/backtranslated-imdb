Striking acting, terrible cast and cheap props. It would be much better if it was set up as a movie with action parody. What a shame. Starting with the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Enemy" The naming of "Action film" would do better. (contributing to the effects of parodies). The policeman looks like a 60-year-old, the blonde still has the same blank look on his face. At the end of the film, they co-operate with him, and together they take away criminals and every time they exchange words, they just feel like a cheap line in front of the porn scene. Grapes. Do not waste time.
