Alexandre Aja's remake The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots in 2006. Not only was it a remake of classic horror, but it was pretty damn good. So almost a year later, we were dealing with the continuation of this remake. While the original scriptwriter Wes Craven is back as a producer and script, this film just does not reach the level of origin and remake. A group of military fighters stopped in the desert to look at some scientists and find out that from the first film they move from a mutant family (at least those that remain plus some new ones). There's plenty of blood. What worries me about this film is the complete lack of characterization. The spectator does not wonder what happens to any of these people because we did not get into them. Even the mutants had some characterization for the last time, and this time nothing. Gore because of the Goru is absurd. There must be a reason why this will be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what about the rape scene in movies lately? Here we have one that has no real reason. Let's hope this is a set of hills to visit again.
