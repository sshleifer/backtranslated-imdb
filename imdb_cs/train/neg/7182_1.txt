I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drizzle (believe me, double negatives are required here - it's so bad). This movie was in trouble from the initial credits when it turned out that the screenwriter was the same person as the composer. The music numbers are too long and none of them are good ("Thank You Very Much" has a nice melody, but the lyrics are stupid for words). I would like to wear the chains that Scrooge wore in the movie bizarre hell sequence rather than sitting back with this insult to the movie musicals again. The only fun part of this film (totally unintentional by the way) includes Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. He was dressed in a silly white costume, and Guinness, through his scenes, was absorbed in what was either an attempt to sound like a ghost, or to show his utter contempt for being in this terrible movie. In the meantime, Albert Finney brings together the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly repulsive character Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is such a terrible man that it's impossible to believe his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination of film making at all costs.
