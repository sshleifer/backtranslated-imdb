It was less than the amazing short film I've seen between the features of Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film came out because of its very intense Technicolor, the film itself was not the one that moved, and sometimes the conspiracy looked pretty pretty - as it was done for classroom use, capturing the attention of a wider audience. consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times things were repeated in the movie - for example, when they talked to her, they usually called "Clara Barton" instead of "Madam", "Miss Barton" or "Clara." In addition, one sick confederate soldier said he was "Johnny Reb, confederate and rebel, ..." - almost like a cartoon character Mojo Jojo of Powerpuff Girls. It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later "Perry White" on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard as President Garfield. Yeah - it's under his beard.
