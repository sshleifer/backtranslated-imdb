On that day I remembered seeing the stupid comics of Nintendo Power that had the same artistic work as this show ... and then came the word that this show came to television near me! I was not estatic, but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was. My friends all said that this show had no real meaning and was too stupid for people like me to enjoy (actually I was gay) so I decided to watch the show with little expectation. HORBIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how many fans drop over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how Chef Kalasaki (or his insignificant name) has become a good guy who owns a restaurant. Bad Motion, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a defeated advisor to King Deded (who is spending big time in this show), and I hate the face of the one company that still supplies Deded with the terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. Then I started to hate Kirby even more, because it was obvious that Nintendo just hurt that Kirby was getting some popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coldness, and Kirby will always be just a little bit of a cream. NUF SAID !!!
