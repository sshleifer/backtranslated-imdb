Who does not! I have heard the tone of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing. The man was right on his nose! This movie was played by pure amateurs. They had to do one, maybe two on each scene, the movie looked sooo hurt. The script was also poor ... they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. "Get Me Out of Me!" Oh, man, I hate it when movies try to do it. It's still happening with comedies ... but with horror film and under-the-scenes actors ... the results are incredibly pathetic. Lines and scenarios were very predictable. But what I felt so negatively about this movie was again the damn actor. It was terrible. Apart from the little Asian guy who worked on the stand. I thought it was great. The film is about 5 stupid tourists who are on vacation in Asia. Eventually they end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of the sex / slaughter mafia. Sounds like a great story. But observing someone with a bad diarrhea is probably more fun and intense. The only reason why this is considered a horror is killing. There was no trace of tension. I like many other horror fans who are dying to have their bloody little gloves on it. But unfortunately with the big U capital, the film was an incredible disappointment. I liked ankle fracture and blood effects. Ordinary girls were too. Everything about this movie is shouted by the amateur. This is the first feature of Ryan Nicholson's long feature and for the most part failed. There is no doubt that he has a bad sense of humor and a sense of horror. I pray that his next film will not play as another horrible movie B ... unless he tells us it will be what will be. Even after this disappointment, I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I saw about him, he is a true, devoted man of this genre. Good luck next time, because it was a bad news.
