there is no tension in this series! When one episode ends, acting is so awkward, the effects are so poor and the script is so terrible that the last thing in mind is how Batman and Robin save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is watching another episode! This show is so boring that I do not see how it ever happened, let alone DVD! It's obvious that the effects are not compared to current Batman movies, but the scenario is terrible. An incoherent crazy disorder about a bad professor and a ray gun or something like that, I'm not quite sure, because it's too bad to follow him. Check out the 60s version, the 90th version, or even the Batman Begins, over this version!
