This film should be on the bottom one. The game is so terrible that when we and my son watched we were almost physically sorry. And the story is worse. I could go on and on about how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a francobo review note because I see no one else has ever gotten into trouble. Do not waste time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thank God we saw it on TV so we did not spare it. If we were to, we would be forced to write people responsible for this abomination and be forced to cast the news in their general direction. Finally, I would like to say that I have always looked at Carrie Fisher's action. But I'm sad to say that it is not worth watching in this particular movie. Do not keep your opinion on Carrie by viewing it.
