Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) was released from the psychiatric facility (even though she killed six people) and set off on a plan of hope for Bartholomew. Once there, she immediately relapses into her criminally mad ways and kills everyone who is between her and her food. <br /> <br /> Is this movie sucked! You know you have problems when you open up loans and it's just credits from the first movie, apparently shot from the television screen. Nick Millard (under his nickname Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of an empty cassette and rental of a video camera for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not translate the video. I really made home movies with a greater production value. And Millard tries to pull out SILENT NIGHT, MADNIGHT NIGHT 2 by cushioning half of the run time with the recording of the first movie (which looks like it was taken from a worn copy of VHS). Alden is good again as Ethel, but the movie is so awkward that you start to like it playing in this garbage. I mean by trying at least the first movie. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if at all possible), awful camera work, terrible sound and adjustments that look as if it were with two videorecorders connected. Avoid it at all costs!
