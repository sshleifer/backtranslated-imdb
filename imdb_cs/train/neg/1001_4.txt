I chased it on DVD and I feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious about DVD comments. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep commentary on human nature without realizing that her story is practically a genre. Moreover, it is a bit simplified about this problem in many ways, and character behavior often transforms faith. I would say his movie that you would get something if you have not had a lot of film / tv / literature / life (to be honest, I've seen almost the same story in horror comic books even). Otherwise, his point was made before and more artistically. And that gets to the big problem, which means it does not really have much cinematic interest in it. The result is a rather insignificant film that invests everything into the idea that the basic story will be shocking and convincing and that it does not really pay.
