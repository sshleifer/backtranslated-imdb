I grew up with a scooby (a bit of what is happening), I hate my skin, I love Daphne and I feel it is not complete with the whole gang. But that's sad, scooby doo is a mysterious comedy - it's not a bad totally spy jap anime. I love "what's new," had to sometimes give Daphne's dangerous mood to become a real man :( and trying to lose sex sexual jokes for many generations, but this "get the leash" is just dirty and should not be a Scooby name attached. trying to do some lame punk thing with the theme song.now now I'm going to watch my DVD Scooby Doo where you wash the dirt from this new series of eyes
