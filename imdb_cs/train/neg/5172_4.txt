This is the second movie I've seen in Horrorfest last weekend that Gravedants are the first. Gravedans were better. I can only guess that it will monitor that production has to be quite limited. I admit that the story started to be interesting, but it finally went to me. We did not have enough time to sympathize or understand some of the characters that just made each of their irregular characteristics even more annoying. I must mention that there was also a little mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy playing as a sheriff. The only reason I sat down was to find out what a big secret it was, which turned out to be not interesting. Some other family background would help, but I did not even think she could start with her family at all. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I have not even seen on DVD. Four reviews are for the initial potential of the story. It was a skip to horrorfest.
