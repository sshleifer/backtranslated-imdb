The film had some good acting and good moments (though apparently low budgets) but a bad rating given that the underlying premise is poorly developed. The main point of conflict between these two leaders is not at all realistically at all. There are several scenes in which they do not agree, but no deep-sea talks that would explain how they can be together when they see the world so different, especially when Glenn is employed in this part of his life (and Adam is sufficiently active with by supporting him with time and money.) Several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for how he is (apologizing to Adam for his past), while Adam is provable and "traditional," which the film eventually declared a "good" path. I do not like to preach. After reviewing the LTR, I took part in a discussion with the director, and he said he had introduced the conflict between them, because if he had been in Glenn's shoes (and he said he was real about Glenn's point of view) with Adam's views. Well, I think he should do a much better job of explaining how Glenn can do in the movie. The director also said that he was directing this, his first film, to reading (Director for Dummies.) The director was not that bad, but far from the top effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely let the movies feel like frustrated.
