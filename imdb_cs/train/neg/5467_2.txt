What to say about this movie. It's probably a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students who sell more bad medication to people. Two of these people have adverse effects when one turns into a toxic kind of avenger and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's all there is to do, and they'll stretch for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be forever locked. Though it's not fair, some people like Troma movies and they can watch if they want to. But the three films for me are the worst movies they have. I have just watched this morbid curiosity.
