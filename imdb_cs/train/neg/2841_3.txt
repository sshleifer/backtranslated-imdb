SAKURA KILLERS (1+ out of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie could look cool ... if you never saw a good * ninja movie. Cheesy's 80s music ... Cheese dialogue ... Cheese performance ... and successive series of martial arts. The most beautiful scene is at the beginning ... with an aging Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach ... Several black-dressed ninjas are trying to intercept him and seem to be too happy to hit a ball to notice ... suddenly he gets into a golf bag and ... naw, it's not for you ... if you ever have the bad luck to see this movie, then you'll thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something else. A lot of crazy caucasian heroes are trained by ninja paths because "just a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. It seems odd that these guys are not fighting better than they did after the training ... oh, the movie moves very sharply. Battle scenes may not be great .. but there are plenty ... and exaggerated sound effects are good for a couple of chic.
