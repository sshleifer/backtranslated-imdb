Describing this movie as waste is unfair. At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This shot was neither absorbed nor fun. Kevin Bacon may have a great chance, so he undoubtedly had an IRS account that he could deal with when he agreed to this terrible scenario. The crazy scientific story "Hollow Man" was narrated earlier, it was said better, and he was told without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. Most of these special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical doll of men, women and dogs that you could buy at the beginning of the seventies. In the UK, they were marketed as a "Transparent Man," which is perhaps the place to get the title for this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, modest script, non-existent conspiracy. <br /> <br />
