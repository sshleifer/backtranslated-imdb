This film is soaked! They took some of my childhood and raped him in the cellar! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and stick to my "Dukes" DVD and cry in the corner. The cast was terrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving the car. When was the Boss Hogg Evil? When was Rosco a hard man? They were never! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke the pots? He never did! Do not let me down, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chuck, but there was no room in this movie! The only thing that was good in this movie was the movie trailers and end credits. It was a waste of money and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
