This movie is one of the most horrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do a favor and avoid this incompetent preparation. <br /> <br /> Taking annoyance is not counted as the "direction" that this movie needed in ravens. Not that writing was all amazing, rather we had abandoned lots of totally artificial characters that were heading in the most artificial way (a pseudo-documentary "style" appreciated by those who do not know how to drive). <Br /> <br /> This film creates the impression that cynically refers to critics who do not know the first thing about making movies (which is most of them). <br /> <br /> It's terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what happened to Victor Vargas being introduced.
