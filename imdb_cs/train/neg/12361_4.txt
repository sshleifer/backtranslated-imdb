I've seen this recent Woody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and I've been trying to see everything he does, even though reviews of this movie have led me to expect unsatisfactory efforts. They were right. It's a confused film that can not decide whether she wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about a middle-aged woman's crisis. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has married a great wealth and lives a life of purposeless luxury with her boring husband and two young children. This somewhat common conspicuous concept is revived with such inappropriateities as the old Chinese folk healer, which makes it invisible with some magic herbs and the spirit of a former lover (with whom he is flying over Manhattan). If the good stories for you are too fantastic about something more prosaic, like a saxophone issue? <br /> <br /> I was never sure what this confused confusion was trying to say. There's only a handful of really fun moments in the movie, and it's really a pointless touch to Pollyanna. Instead, it is necessary to pursue crimes and misdemeanors, a perfectly balanced film that overcomes comedy with an emphasis on ethics and morality. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan."
