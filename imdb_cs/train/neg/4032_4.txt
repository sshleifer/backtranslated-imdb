I've never heard of this before it shows up on cable TV. It's a typical science fiction end of the fifties: sober, depressing and not too paranoid! Despite the typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is filmed in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheaper way to leave a lot of exhibits on narrative and excuses so that it is possible to put as many movies as humanly possible for what is undoubtedly an extremely low budget! While this is not in itself unintelligible (the apocalypse-over-renegade-rocket angle later used, with a much greater aplomb, both for DR STRANGEL [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, a lot of unintentional laughter - especially in scenes involving immediate labor and gang of insignificant juvenile delinquents!
