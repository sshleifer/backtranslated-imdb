This movie is amazing. I was looking at her the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said he was all right, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He shot the film completely unlike those horrible Hollywood movies like Matrix and STOP or my mom will shoot. It could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big dance that the witty man wears. I think he's the smartest guy from the domino pizza. Not only does this movie look great, just like the out-of-focus films my father made from my birthday when I turned 6. It's going to tell a tricky story with dozens of characters that seem totally unrelated but they all meet at the end. It's a genius of how this web is woven to get it all together. I wish Ted V. Mikels continued. But it needs more foreigners. And a pirate.
