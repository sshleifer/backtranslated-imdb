Thank God I did not go to the cinema for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if a movie can be worse than this movie. have spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. a terrible actor and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote the comments are men from this movie company;) it's a very big fiasco! can they still laugh at this movie in 2000? embarrassing...
