The assumption sucked me, but it was clear for about 30 seconds, for it was either David Lynch or something terribly awful. It is interesting to follow through the basic list of laundry. I can be crazy about the disturbing spiritual work (Romero comes to mind), but this was nothing spiritual. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend to be eighty-year-old (or simply to get lobotomy-Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any kind of self-confidence, or we will evoke the second coming. It is such an attitude that people fly into the jet nozzles into 110 buildings (working around the corner from the site of the former WTC). I like to think that God is a little bigger.
