I watched this film as an example of fine art by Matthew Barney. He must have prepared me. I almost missed the show and in retrospect it probably had. In addition to great score (Bjork) and rich and colorful photography, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to find out what the pearl divers were looking for. The film was a predominantly silly mix of Japanese cultural links and industrial shots of modern whaling techniques that were used in simulated hunting / harvesting. The movie "culminates" with enough free shock to help lift your stomach. What was the point of the movie? Whilst others might claim to be whales, he might also think he justifies somehow whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "blink" the audience with his anal, facial, self-mutilation and cannibal fetishes. Bottom line: If you really do not make Barney's sense of art, you do not care about this movie. The report is obscure, the pace is slow, and cultural references are demanding. If you're shocked, you'll do better in one of the many Undead movies, or you'll be hunting an old copy of Hustler and taking a facial artwork.
