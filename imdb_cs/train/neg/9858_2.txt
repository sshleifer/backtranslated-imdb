This movie is not fun. It simply takes the D & D nerd stereotypes and strengthens them. All the main characters are less than 30k a year, all live with their parents, all are socially retarded and have no happiness with women. Jokes are terrible and unthinkable, like two players who got white colored because one of them had a KKK-looking hood (it was his magical costume) and the other guy had to warm up on John Rocker (oh how funny, he's a jerk, so he does not know a sport). You may have to be a childish college student to find one of these things funny. Bad mockmuntars are so painful to be supervised, but of course extremely cheap. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only opportunities available for hotties.
