The first episode of this new show was today and it was terrible. Not only does Shaggy have a new sandy voice that causes torture of his lines, but it's so far from the original concept and animation style that he is barely recognizable as the Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma disappeared and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team still solved the mysteries. This new show instead presents Shaggy and Scooby fighting James Bond super-villain and his henchmen while living in the home. There is not even a car called "The Mystery Machine" (and a teaser for another episode that promised that the car of the robot from the transformers did not keep my mind). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do it? <br /> <br /> The show gets two points for two scenes representing the entire Scooby Doo gang, all talking with the right voices except Shaggy, and even if I'm too generous.
