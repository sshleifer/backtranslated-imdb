I know, I know, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Manos, Hands of Fate". But I can not deal with these socks. The course * is bad. How can they be good? But if you are talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and banking talent, T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl". Versatile falseness, all the assimilation that has blotted out what Barbra Streisand has done since 1964 will reach its pinnacle in this film. From his lonely peak of horror, "Yentl" looks back at "A Star is Born" and passes "The Mirror Has Two Faces". Nothing else likes it altogether. What emotional hobbies have attracted Streisand out to make this film, I'd rather not play and what the audience is playing, I can not imagine it, even if I bet nine out of ten that you are not a member. /> <br /> Nobel Prize and Holy Guardian of Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he publicly threw it out. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she has not only committed suicide but has continued to make frightening movies.
