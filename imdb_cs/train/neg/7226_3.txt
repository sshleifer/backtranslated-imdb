I love comics. Although I have problems with fully understanding the stories? the visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew why I was. Surprisingly, did I understand the main fence? but some extremely bad decisions when it happened for your visual style. <br /> <br /> I think - really bad-looking "CG human actors" - in a close look? ??Why?! It did not work at all! Horus - and other Egyptian gods - was successfully produced in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors this movie could be a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a pity.
