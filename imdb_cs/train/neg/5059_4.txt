To see a movie about two completely unsympathetic characters, it's one. The actor is brilliant, both from John Cassavetes as a mad paranoid, whom he is said to have really gotten to get, and from Peter Falco as his lifetime best friend, who is turning to rescue. A big mistake, but because both are amoral mafias and misogynist bastards who boot, it's hard to decide who to season for less. Only writer / director Elaine May would be able to get away with it. I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michal Hausman on DVD he found that the two stars had "modest ideas" about the scenarios with which the director was hardly able to work that the director of photography was impossible from him that the crew was constantly angry that she could sit around waiting and so on. This mood of one very dysfunctional family will be clearly visible on the screen.
