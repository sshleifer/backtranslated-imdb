This is the worst adaptation of the classic story I've ever seen. They unnecessarily modernize and some points are bad. Songs seldom move around the story. They look random. The flying scene with Marley is absurd and ridiculous. It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's probably considered a classic because "Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was classical does not mean there is any inexpensive adaptation.
