Sentimental School Drama in Denmark, 1969, "Surprise", offers a nice Danish interest in American culture. Frits, obsessed, naive 13-year-old boy, performs with half of his ear hanging from the office of brutal master Lindum-Svenden (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, school headmaster, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, controls the local community. Lindum-Svendsen is too distant this time and his father is recovering from a mental breakdown (certainly not enough drama) and too stereotypical hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ("Hello, call me Freddie"), Frits stands up for justice. <br /> <br /> I will tell you what. It's so unconvincing, convinced, and so full of suffering that a "family" picture of this grotesque - clich√©-filled - excuse for the film fails unfortunate to convince a non-Scandinavian audience. We apologize, kindly to Danish readers, so they collapsed in your sentimental ways. But that's certainly not the story of a "boy who becomes a man fighting the system". A boy never becomes a human, but rather stays naive, with a big, eye-screaming face. If you call the church of small small people who lead the dictator as a cartoon character "system", I am sorry to miss something. <br /> <br /> If you are on family pictures, go to Happy Feet.
