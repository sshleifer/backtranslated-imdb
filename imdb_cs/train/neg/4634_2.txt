of course she has some talent, Maria Bello is always great. but it's just a scary waste of time, rendering every character as someone to be scornful and abusive to make a movie of an interesting story. I hope they get out of their systems. Unfortunately, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and no humanity at all for the audience. which would be fine, except that it does not make sense, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive about what to say about the story she is trying to say. the bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" are an unintended warning to viewers. it means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some of the events they've heard about, so they just fit the screen and expect the true nature of the story so the audience will feel something without the filmmakers doing any work. I hope they had a great time filming this movie. it smells on ice.
