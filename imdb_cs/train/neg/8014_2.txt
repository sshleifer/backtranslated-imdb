"I know the wild tigers." It will only manifest in large cities. It's one of those SO arts movies that makes no sense whatsoever, except for the director! I hate you! And all those hideous alternative people are trying DESPERATELY to find "metaphors" in what EVIDENT horseshit is. There was no conspiracy, no story, no morals, no chronology, and nothing fun or even touching. For me, it was a lot of scenes that popped up together, which had nothing to do with them, and they were all on show to show how they could get arts and visuals. It was ATTEMPT in yet another film of teenage anxiety, but lacked the brand on every level humanly possible. Then loans role! I was waiting for SENSE! I'm waiting for "a good part." I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which are probably called "art house" films. It will not be between them. You will be very upset about paying for seeing this movie without buying it on DVD.
