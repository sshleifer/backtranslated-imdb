just below the surface lies what? just a terrible movie is what other audiences have justified saying that the storm sequences are just ridiculous. crunchy, already depleted firewood in the rain? now it's clever. threat? foreboding? sexual tension? for those who read boring and conventional, boring and conventional and boring and too nasty. I would like to thank God for the scene of mia sara, but in retrospect I think filmmakers, when they see the complete mess, realize that they have to put something in order to do it in the middle. so it will become another creation. do a favor and give it to her.
