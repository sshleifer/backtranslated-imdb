This is the worst thing that TMNT franchise has ever accomplished. I was a kid when it came out and I still thought it was a deuce even though I liked the original cartoon. There is one scene I remember when a mafia monkey explains to her guides what rhetorical questions they are. It's ugly. Many fans hate the series for having a female turtle, but it did not bother me. So much that I did not even remember her until I recently read the show. Overall, it's incredibly forgotten. The only one was the thematic song. Guilty pleasure, they say it ... Nananana ninja ...
