I almost called HBO and demanded money for the month just because it was broadcast. I can only see the film executors sitting around. "Well, we have to come up with something that is like Home Alone, we add a little bit of cash to the kid, we hire harsh actors and oh, we do it a lot less fun!" <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you have here. It's not worthwhile seeing anyone borrowing it. And as a movie for children? Forget it. I would not allow my children to see it, not because of bad jokes, but because I did not want them to say, "What do you think it shows us this is crap, dad ?!"
