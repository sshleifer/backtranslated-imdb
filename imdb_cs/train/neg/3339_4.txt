Barry, a medical transcriptionist, has his mind corroded by his work associated with the remembrance of gross upbringing in the hands of his stepfather, Barry (Original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals into madness and eventually serial killer. Good (in the form of a homosexual) and evil (in the form of a bare mute boy) struggles to control his soul. This film is rejected by some miserable and unintentional humorous scenes. Do not say it's terrible or anything else, just because you say it's just as well known as it's because of the incredible fan base of Bruce Campbell (who I am) who will probably see something with which in some way participates. <br /> <br /> My rating: C- <br /> <br /> Extra DVD: Comment with Michael Kallio and Bruce Campbell; Second comment by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport; "Hate Every Minute" 17 minutes of documentary film; deleted and enhanced scenes; alternative takes; outputs, world premiere footage; Poster and static gallery; Talent bios; DVD-Rom: Scenario in .PDF format <br /> <br /> 2 Easter eggs: highlight laughing eyes (left eye) and minute, real Easter eggs (right eye)
