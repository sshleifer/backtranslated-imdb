I usually try to compile reasonably criticized criticism of the films, but I can not believe it went beyond the screenplay scenario. Dialogue is scary, it is very nasty, accents are awful, and direction and stimulation are at best bad. I do not remember the last time I saw a movie that's pretty bad. Joseph Fiennes, as nice as he, could have killed his career as quickly as it had begun. Doctor Moreau's island was no worse than this garbage.
