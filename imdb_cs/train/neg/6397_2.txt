This is the problem I have with movies that come on television when nothing can be traced. Somehow I get into really bad movies. But this was very observable. The notion of being the only ones who stayed on Earth after a comet then found out that the zombies are around, makes me laugh. That's why I gave this movie 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but you laughed (too stupid> funny). I think I just watched because Star Trek was the leader. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and it was the only funny character.
