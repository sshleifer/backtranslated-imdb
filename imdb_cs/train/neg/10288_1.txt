First I just want to say I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode makes ridicule the whole show. I do not know what they were trying to achieve with this episode, but they have successfully created the worst episode in the whole series. </ br /> <br /> There is no story line, everything is chaotic, and jokes ..... are bullshit. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example "how furlings look like" by creating that stupid "before on ..." ...... is just embarrassing. It is clear that writers are running out of ideas and that's really bad.
