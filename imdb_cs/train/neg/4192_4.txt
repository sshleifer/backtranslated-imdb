In this short urban man and his wife, their strange life is set aside when one takes his old red mother's trouser suit in law. I was still watching it hoping to understand why it was made, or why the other reviewers found it fun. It was a complete waste of time for me. <br /> <br /> Not everyone tastes the same, but it was not mine.
