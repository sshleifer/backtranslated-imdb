I thought the whole joke from the movie would be seeing some rich white guy who acted like Chris Rock, and then seeing Chris Rock responding to people's reactions. Instead, you can see that Chris Rock is alone and people did not understand it. There are maybe 2 scenes throughout the movie where they use their trick. That should be much better.
