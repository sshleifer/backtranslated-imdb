This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH ENIEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) AGNISAKSHI was the only one to work and the better film DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan, who unfortunately failed in their attempt, the story was good but the manipulation was not so good and the hero proved too regressive and the peak was too disappointing <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi assumed his role YAARANY (strangely it was also a SWTE remake) and looks too bold on the lead and is ok Juhi is decent while Arbaaz is trying too hard in his debut and in many scenarios he can beat the audience but his voice was terrible Johnny is too loud
