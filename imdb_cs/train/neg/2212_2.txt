This low-budget plot B horror comes with all the extras - a mad scientist supplemented by a helper, a malicious corporate greed in the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology .... it can not leave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the weak back story means a decline in the population of a generic pharmaceutical company that motivates its evil Shakespeare to quote the CEO to entertain an unsolicited offer from a former employee / scientist who has been eliminated from his job as research manager and who is also a nut ... of course Herbert West wannabe ). It offers new stem cell technology that could make so much money ... or it seems ... This attracts a few employees to its island of Moreau-ish (it had to be a pretty impressive output package from the company when he let go for him to allow the island) to confirm his scientific knowledge including the CEO and, incidentally, the former fianc√© son of the mad scientist now morphed the sharkuman (as comfortable) .... A plan, a kind, is the rebirth of lost love between former wedding forces, while demanding revenge for former colleagues to end him. (Sheez, how can this guy be hot? Does he actually have his Friggenic island ...) Soon everyone is on the run (from an endless supply of security guards, from mutant plants? Can there be an uncharted island without a man-eating plant? a taste for a massacre, a chatch of boy breeding plans and a lack of cell phone signal) ... and everyone must learn to work together to get out of the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will someone escape? Will a new species be created? Check it out and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some fun in this movie, but do not expect much ... for a true Combs fan, you do not have to miss it. <br /> <br /> Do not say I warned you.
