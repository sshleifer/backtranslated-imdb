There is no sun drop in "The Sunshine Boys", which makes the title of this comedy Neolitical comedy by Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which is insignificant), equates to age with irrational behavior - and worse, clumsy, galumphing, irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthless when we played an old Veudevilian artist who had joined a former television comedian George Burns for a television special (they are said to be a 43-year-old team, which raises the question of how long did vaudeville last?). Burns, who earned the Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the movie for about thirty minutes, after which Matthau had already burned the material to hell and back. The more the film is noisy, the less tolerable and observable. Director Herbert Ross worked only solidly when he was not linked to one of Neil Simon's scenarios; here Ross sets the gag as a crazy amateur, knocking off on combat routines that have not paid off (such as the half-mattress Matthau appeared in the garage of auditioning mechanics for television advertising). At this point, Matthau was too young for this role, and over-aligned by slipping and plunging. It was up to Ross and Simon to ease the character to force his temper to make the Sunshine Boys a sun, but Walter continues to speak as if we were all deaf. The image looks creepy and it is at a perfect pace; soon hope is waiting for them. * 1/2 from ****
