What the hell is in your mind? This movie is upset! Every minute I was getting more and more bored. I tried to watch the end because I hope it will at least happen! But instead, I am amazed at how boring the end was treated to ... What is this story about this bloody "bogeyman"? How come he will not die? He is a bloody human being for God! A boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. And then what ? His stay at the psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is a fascinating stupidity ... It's a must for stupidity. I want to sell it to a stupid guy who immediately understands the stupid film.
