The film "Gung Ho!": The story of Carlson Makin Island Raiders was created in 1943 in order to emulate the morals of the American people during the Second World War. It shows the better way that cinema can be propaganda. The value of this movie is just a collection and not artistic. In the film of propaganda it is unnecessary to judge the direction and actors. Check out this movie if you're interested in learning how propaganda works in movies, or you're a great fan of Robert Mitchuma, who has a small role in the film. If you want to see the film after World War II, there are much better and more objective. I rated it 4/10.
