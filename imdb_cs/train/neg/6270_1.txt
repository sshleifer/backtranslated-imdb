Somehow, a woman who works with a scientist puts metal balls into the mouth of people who are supposed to change their personality, but in fact, they turn them into crazy killers like a zombie. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are lightly dressed, bloody young women desperately in need of fictional lessons. This movie is terrible, cruel, and terribly bad. The script has little or no logic. You will really have trouble watching what is happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen, which supposedly represents enormous scientific progress, looks nothing more than the old Atari screen. What's even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair (it looks like a lonely guy in the summer camp did it) named George, who is like a personal servant / confidant Jessica (a leading "actress"). Throughout the movie you will be exposed to the idiotic, sophisticated testimony of this puppet. But wait ... you also get a lot of softcore, unerotic, barely naked scenes with girls with some bar boys. All the time there is the most unpleasant soundtrack in the background, like some spiritual discovery. None of the actors are good. There are only varying degrees of bad. Gore and "horror" aspects are particularly inappropriately shot. The movie really looks like a teenager. No coincidence Henry Sala, director on behalf of but not a business, did not make another movie. I was bored almost in a coma that was looking at this silly, silly! And how do you end up? What happened? If you know, let me enter the secret because I can not understand because of my life. The only thing I know is that I lost my time spent watching this waste, which caused the beginning of the weekend to be a real nightmare!
