Why did I lose 1.5 hours of my life when I watched it? Why was this film even made? Why did I even comment on this movie? One reviewer said the movie was watching patience and it was not for everyone. I can not find out for whom this film is intended. maybe after omitting an acid attack, SOME, some might look at it and make some sense of it. It is discontinuous, not experimental, it is simple and simple waste. The movie can not do anything at all, only if you think you have something, well ... you do not. <br /> <br /> I think the end brought the film some finality (no verbs were intended), the spectator saw what could be done. I do not think I put a spoiler here, it does not matter. This film is another film that must escape in the world of film.
