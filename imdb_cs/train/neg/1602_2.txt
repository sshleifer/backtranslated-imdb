Anyone who thinks this film was not appreciated by his comedy genius had to smoke with his two friends in the movie. This movie is not undervalued ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There are no comparisons between this movie and a naked gun or airplane because the last two films are well written and entertaining. The Reunion class is not one of these things. The sad thing is that he has such a potential (good cast, good stories), but good jokes are little and far. Scenes that were supposed to be humorous were more uncomfortable than entertaining. Stoner boys, vampire, blind girl ... NOT FUNNY. The only fun character was Delores (the one who sold the soul to the devil). National Lampoon has created some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. Certainly I expected more from John Hughes.
