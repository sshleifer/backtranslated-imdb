He saw it on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to see it or spend money on renting. The film is completely predictable - from the damaged owner and planner to the pierced electrical cables. The conspiracy is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert is hit by a 20-inch wave of bone frayed avalanches (with real shots) and all he has to do is get up and shake. The avalanche is thundering down a million kilometers an hour and stops dead on the side of the road. Some of the real avalanche materials are impressive and show their devastating power. But the deal between real avalanche and staged things makes this film even flimsier. <br /> <br /> Take a favor, do not bother with T.V.
