... let me calculate ways. <br /> <br /> 1. Only the "remake" title that pulls out every cliche in the slasher manual. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot is so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. Completely weak performance of all attempts at tension or excitement. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that does not provide any gore, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. Cast characters that are so written and stereotypical that we can not care for them at all. <br /> <br /> 7. Lack of no effectively scary atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A dialogue scenario that is out of the poor - it's awful. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cartoon performances (you are not sure if the guy will be attracted to the guy or the miserable script mentioned above). <br /> <br /> 10. A totally awkward adolescent target remake who is not brave enough to try to have imagination - or even show love of blood. They are ruthless fans of horror, you save money. /> <br /> BOMB outside ****
