There will be a time when children will grow up without seeing a single Bugs Bunny kiss (technically) another man on his lips. There will be a time when it will not be the Duck or Rabbit period. There will be a time when the Tazmanian Devil will be named politically incorrect. But help me, it's not like that. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants an "EXTREME" version of our beloved Loony characters. Who is in marketing who comes up with "corn nuts: corn was wrong" and "Extreme Doritos," and apparently this nasty turd should know that just because they have a degree in the industry or advertising or what it does not mean, kids. <br /> <br /> I think the kids are doing wrong, getting rid of them one of the greatest and most concrete performances of all time. This show disgusts me and it's not just an artillery or a terrible dialogue. They abuse good vocal talents like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and many others. There is no style, humor, character development and especially heart. The show, as well as the repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just a shadow of his former, timeless, beautiful self.
