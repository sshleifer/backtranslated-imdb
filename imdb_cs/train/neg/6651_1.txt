That's absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First, I say that acting was very good and all cast. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be very unfavorable, and in this respect he succeeded. Similarly, the story turns around a self-beloved boy who is a helpless, hopeless, chronic liar whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather shoes. It was worse than tracking a car wreck.
