It could have been a homosexual counterpart of Gone With The Wind, considering his epic length, but instead he was convinced he was a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing is happening. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in the story (in fact, no story) than to search and kiss each other. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic claim, as if they had almost no dialogue, is completely useless in the film than to try to examine the psychology of their characters with some dignity and to achieve true emotional resonance. In addition, he pretends to be an "artistic" film using the worst naive clich√©s of movie snobs. But anyway, if someone can identify with his heavy banality, I think it's okay.
