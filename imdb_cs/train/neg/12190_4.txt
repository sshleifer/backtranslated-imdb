One Scorsese is the worst. Average thriller; the only thing we recommend is De Niro to play psycho. The final is typically of this genre, ie across the top, with another almost invincible daring that is immune to pain. I did not like the 60-year original, and this version was not much to improve. I have no idea why Scorsese is working remarkably. And again, considering how bad his last films are (I mean his boring Buddhist film and all of his new favorite actress, the blonde Di Caprio), it's not that bad. And since Spielberg wanted to make a remake ... he could be much worse.
