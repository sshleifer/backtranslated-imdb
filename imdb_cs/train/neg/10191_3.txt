The boring, flat directorial "comedy" has zero and will hit a large cast. Alan Alda wore too many hats and shows it. Newcomer Anthony LaPaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium, but it is not enough. One of those scripts that if you were unintentional and handed it to the agent or producer, they would be torn apart and rejected without discussion.
