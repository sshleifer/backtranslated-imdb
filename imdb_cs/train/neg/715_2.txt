It sounded like a really interesting movie from the maze. Nazi, occult, government conspiracy. I was expecting a low Nazi budget version of the DaVinci code, or Brazilian boys or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychological, something like David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is said is just terrible. Part of the problem is casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts out of motion and is somewhat shy and afraid. She just does not do well at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor occupied as a son apparently thought it was a comedy. Most of the other actors seemed to think that this was a movie, or at least that way, rather than just being odd. The only one I thought was really good was the daughter of Siri Baruc. Another big part is speed. It starts very slowly. So you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it takes a while for you to suicide your daughter and the consequences. Soon after, everything will become a messy mess. Some of them were useful, but most of them were unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and ill-focused. The real problem is that it's just not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters are sympathetic. Applying images and sets. Some of the movies you see are tortured. That's the viewer. It has several creepy moments, especially prominent Nazi paintings and credits, but the rest of the film is mostly tiresome.
