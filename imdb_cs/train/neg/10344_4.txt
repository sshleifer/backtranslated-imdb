He saw this movie running in the morning on TCM. Several problems with this movie were obvious from what I saw. First of all, adults did not grow up when the children guns for 10 years. Several parts of the film had problems with continuity, and for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked the oldest when it was 10 years. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes so there was a huge gap with the black screen. It's bad, because even if the script left something that would be desirable, Bergman & Russell both did well in the film in their roles. It's a shame that a big piece is missing, but what's here is traceable. I just wish it was all intact. The script does not make sense that Bergman's character is sent away when the children are small, but then brought to take care of them when they are adults? Some time series also do not make sense. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929, but the children are growing up in battle for the First World War. All the actor's performances in this movie are all right. Just wonder what was within the limits of a movie I did not see because it was missing.
