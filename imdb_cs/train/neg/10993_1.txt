Sure, we all love bad movies at one time or another, and we really like it, but it was not a pleasure to blame, it was just bullshit. Some guy, a vince offer that is horrified enough to be a main character, probably drunk / high - probably both - and thought it was a great idea to shoot a movie. He then went on to show his script to equally high / drunk individuals. Overall, this film was so bad, predictable and indefinable that I could not get it for 20 minutes before turning it off. It makes you have been serving, looks like Citizen Kane. Bat-man? WTF ... Some guy walking around with a bat is really original. Almost as good as a fat man says, and he has a fat boy who goes in a superhero suit.
