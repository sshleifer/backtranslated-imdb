When I read this novel before I saw this movie, I was extremely disappointed with the wooden actress and the arrogance of the producers in their apparent ignorance of the plot. I feel that this film in no way reflects the brilliant work of Bronte and rather impresses on a shallow love affair. When film was condensed for 2 hours, the film lost many of its key features, making the book understandable and progressive, resulting in somewhat distorted land with little ground. There is no romance between Rochester and Jane Eyr, so it seems somewhat violent and unjustified because both characters have an occasional interaction you can not help but imagine their "love" is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel, you do not show any impression of Jane's strange face and courage that attracts her to Rochester, and his arrogance attracted to Jane. Despite the poor scripting, I think some of the characters were portrayed very handy, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall production was bad. Due to better scripting, the movie might have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clark and Timothy Dalton for Outstanding Productions.
