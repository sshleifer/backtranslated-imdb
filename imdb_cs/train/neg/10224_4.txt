Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, an overview of one line says it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is the original and there are "Leon" elements. And they are better - much better! In "Samurai," Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer who holds a bird in a cage and steals cars for his job (with such tension in those scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai looks for death in dignity and is shot with a blank pistol in his hand. The world has changed to realize it and there is no room for the samurai in it. Delon does not take as many people as Ghost Dog. But I think Jarmusch likes "Leon" very or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. He added it too. And let me guess: The girl will become a professional like Ghost Dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? So what did Jarmusch think after all? Where is the unique, original idea in this movie? I can not see the place when making copies of carbon (celluloid). Rating 4/10 by Macaulay Connor
