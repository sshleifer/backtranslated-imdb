So Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big smile and was afraid to see this movie at the beginning, but when he saw it, it was not a horror or a thriller. Basically, I enjoyed the movie in my seat because it was so predictable. You could predict what will happen next. The young actors were all right when they played their characters but I had to say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - he behaves wisely. Yes, I make props for plot because it was good, but that is not exciting or frightening. There were almost zero scenes "jumping in the seat". So do not lose ten dollars who see it in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
