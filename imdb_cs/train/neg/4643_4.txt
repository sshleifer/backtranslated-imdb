I rented the movie on DVD. I knew the film would not live on what he had promised me on the back of the trunk, but once I found Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I had to rent it. It starts quite well, assuming that the squeegees are transmitted over the cable. However, the main character has nothing to her that makes her feel sorry, and the end of the movie really lets hang. There are too many unanswered questions. At the end, there was a great scene that surprised me, but overall it's a very sublime movie, but I think it's worth paying a $ 3.99 payment fee.
