It focuses on non-ironic ideas about how to deal with guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill plays a disturbed boy to halt his "wailing" of Rennie's death. The old style of real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The murderous aircraft model and car crash have to be impressive on the big screen. The story itself, despite the flash sequences, plays it straight - all narrators are trusted (regardless of "truth" or "untrue" in the dialogue), so the viewer is not a play about narrative structure. This would become a rough template for future overwriting, such as "Fearless". So all we have is an individual performance, and at this level is best for Wynn's banter, a male show.
