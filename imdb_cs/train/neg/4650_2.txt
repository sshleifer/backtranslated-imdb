With the engagement of the British British characters and the pleasant photographs of Britain's 50s, I was hoping to expect this movie to be entertained. Unfortunately, I found myself glued for improper reasons - I could not believe how terrible it was. I had to watch thousands of old films and I was always ready for the products to have their time, but it was really hard. <br /> <br /> As others have said, the main problem is that it's not that they do not seem to know what they want to be: a fine romantic comedy, a scary comedy or a musician. I was a bit furious when Jeannie Carson collapsed for about 15 minutes into a song! This is not credible at any level, not even happening, or the fact that Daisy has never revealed a threat to her. Other aspects that gave up credibility included Donald Sinden's cast as a songwriter (for God!), The fact that she had Diane Dorsa as a fianc√©e and seems to have little interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) And ridiculous a scene in the songwriter's office. The whole thing is stupid in the worst possible way. If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be at first with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after all, it went down in a great way.
