This soulless movie is a bit of bullshit and boredom as a repetition of the whole house. For all people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror film, they should not even think about looking at this pile of ruthless work. F - in my opinion. I have one question, what do they think? Meet: 1) Bad Script 2) Bad Script 3) Bad Script 4) Bad Actor 5) Bad Direction and last but not least Bad Script. I mean, I do not like every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched him. This film should be forbidden in a box, locked and immersed in the sea. So please do not do something like this again, please, please!
