This is one of the most powerful films I've ever had to watch unhappy! I had to expect it after seeing the first two, but I still get into these types of movies with the idea, "Maybe this time they did the right thing." Nope - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where to start? What about special effects ... If you want to imagine what SFX is going through in this movie, at one point, the soldier shoots at Raptor as he runs down the corridor. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it's just a tail-man who is probably connected to it. Bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> And what about acting? If that's what you can call it. There is one character that should be from the south. However, after six years of living in the South, I never heard what she was talking about. Perhaps he has a special share - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing to require this accent - so there was no reason for the actor to try to do it. What's up? It's absolutely basic - Raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them. I'm beginning to wonder why dinosaurs always get into the nearest tunnel system in these movies ... do not they want to stay outdoors to catch the prey? Hello, at least it makes sense that there is very little to be found in the movie that is reportedly revolving around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you are in the building and you know the predators run in it. Would you decide to spend the time to have an argument about who is better - an army or a sailor? And then you decide to have a match with your shoulder? What is the idiotic idea of ​​having to trace a predator - Divide into two groups. Have they never watched horror movies (or at least the Scooby Doo episode)? In short, it's one of those silly movies. Leave it if you do not want to run through the movie.
