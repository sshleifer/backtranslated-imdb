Good Earth is by no means a great movie, it's usual. Perhaps it was different in the 1930s, but who would want to see the life of the farmer. I'm not very interested. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are doing a great job, but the film has lasted too long. I could tell you the end of this movie with the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, is exactly like him. They both fall in love with their husbands just as they are on deathbeds. The film makes a complete 360 ​​transition from one generation to the next. Also, this film did not have a good acting character or fun moments, but it was just a depressing thing about being a farmer at the time of the crisis.
