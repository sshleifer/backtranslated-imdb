Of all the movies I've seen, this film The Rage must be one of the worst. With direction, logic, continuity, script changes and dialogue, I was frightened of pain. "How can anyone come up with something so dirty?" Gary Busey is known for his "B" films, but it's a certain "W" movie. (W = waste). Take, for example: about two dozen FBIs, and local lawmakers surround a towing house with a jeep. Inside is a MA jeep and is "confused" why all the cops are. Within a few seconds, a gunshot gun comes up and the MA is killed. The cops are thrown on a jeep with gary, and the company pays them off. The cops fall as a domino and a jeep with Gary rides around in circles and is not hit by one bullet / pellet. MA is killed and Gary does not seem to notice that the guy is tough. Indeed, a miracle, not because the six shooter held 300 rounds, was such a miracle.
