Wearing her hair shirts. Positively, absolutely, without shadow of doubt one of the worst movies ever. Pure torture. Of tens of stars zero. One long, lengthy, demanding, demanding, self-confident, theatrical, and lead art scene. Designed as dreamlike and impresionist, the soul was exposed, instead it is a rosy mane. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son are spoiled and whispering lovers. "Homo-erotic" is a point, loud and clear. Okay, so what? <br /> <br /> Repeatedly more than one son is the line, allegedly lifted from "Life of Saints," "Father's love crosses, loving son is crucified." The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is cumbersome, irrelevant and bombastic, just like everything else. Some links refer to the theme of Russian affiliation: "Mother and Son" (1997); "Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and sons"; and of course Dostoyevsky, "Karamazov brothers." Credits in English indicate the intended international distribution, which means we can not use an excuse that you have to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is nowhere near or impossible as Sokurova's last "Russian Ark" (2003). Like in "Mother and Son," some scenes are filmed from deforming mirrors, though not so interesting. The film is almost monochrome, filming from start to finish through beige filters and doing so visually as it is dramatically disturbing. Slightly focused haze only contributes to an irritated feeling. <br /> <br /> An unpleasant soundtrack is hiding, never stopping like a tape loop. The old radio is constantly playing in the background. Russian romantic melancholy infinitely swells like "topics based on Tchaikovsky". The presence of "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) of course means that all "irritating little sounds, radio static sounds, sounds, distortions and the like are" designed ". <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov ) has actually written this thing.This seems to be as free as a transport, as if improvised by bored actors coming out of nothing to nothing.The modern art eventually managed to signal the thing without it being a thing so what we see is the thought an idea, empty as a shell, but not a shell, just a shell idea. Could it be asked to better define decadence?
