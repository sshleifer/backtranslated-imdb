When I first saw this movie, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of the double track. Glenn Ford, an armaments expert, is called upon to dispose of a hidden bomb on a high-explosive train. The voltage is slow and steady; and this black-and-white film runs for about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; tension and drama lose most of their impact. This is still a good movie as far as the early 1950s standards are concerned. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteer plays Victor Maddern.
