In what seemed like the longest 1 hour 35 that I had to last, Al Pacino delivers accurate performance. Not by its usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Someone to drink when he encounters forgetting meetings when we realize that Hollywood's social life has depleted his life energy. But in this movie we need somebody who likes it. And for some reason every character in the picture says, "I do not know why I like you Eli," on Al Pacino's drama and I could not even get close to liking him. other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn have done nothing to change their established personalities on television or in earlier films. And Kim Basinger was not even long enough to provide some performance. The film story had no impetus. Most scenes never lead the story forward, but rather gather facts about attitudes that later came into play at the counter-limb end. He had the potential, in addition to their reluctance to build on the story. What is the purpose of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would believe you: "Once Hollywood has you, you can not get out." Yeah, right! That's why so many people are burning in Hollywood.
