An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside the hospital. It recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and the old episodes of the zone at dusk. Atmospherically strong setting was great. There were also some very clever moments of "time loop" that always have so much bursting of the head. The story had a lot of indefinite links that led me to believe that all subsequent curiosity - time sliding / ghosts / strange bat noble and a fairly stupid heavy metal ghoul - thing will be explained. And that was the dark floor that seriously deactivated me. Based on my tour, the film does not provide any explanation of what's behind the events. While there is always a certain ambiguity in these kinds of films. Dark floors have reached new heights of indeterminacy. I do not expect things to be wrapped in a nice ribbon, but I should not even have the feeling, "Huh? .. Is that so? ... Did I get a dose? Maybe I hit the chapter in error?" Dark floors have left me a deeply unsatisfied suspicion that "it was all a dream," which is a shame, because until the last reel I was very on board and enjoyed the film.
