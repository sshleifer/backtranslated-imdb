This conspiracy is so manipulative and counts with the uncertain and unthinkable decisions of adults in every decision about parenthood. Kids are great in terms of spell and delivery of the line, but as I say, the whole plot depends on the fact that every adult is a complete idiot, so in that case he understands his actions more (and at the same time it is the only way to explain boys action full mistrust). Why would sweet charming little boys take a child out of the shore? How did the kid get to the shore and at the same time he thought it was LAST the place to look for? Why would not the two boys NEVER be informed, and instead of missing the baby, nobody gives them a picture of running with food and diapers, and all that's going on, and literally everything she's looking for? There is no reason to ask the audience to believe it. Asking it to believe that it will make a lawsuit (even informal setting) is too insulting to bare.
