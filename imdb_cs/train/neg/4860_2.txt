A horrible, terrible TV show! Why the Central Comedy has decided to repeat the old episodes of this program is beyond me. It's really upset! Of course I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I was talking exclusively about those seasons, this show would get eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are good. They were and were terrible. The comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL!!! The original cast was full of highly talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever it is called), all of which should have better bids after MAD TV ends. This show is overvalued and less worthy of your surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another terrible show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun and leave TV MAD to kill and die as it deserves.
