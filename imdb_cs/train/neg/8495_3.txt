I'm the kind of guy who went to the local library and read the books about Babbage's difference while my classmates played football etc. So if it's something like a target audience for this movie then I think it's probably going to be included. <br /> <br /> Maybe I have to watch it again. An earlier reviewer said he was not watching this movie when he was tired. Maybe it was my fault. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this movie, and these are aspects I like, but overall I found it amateur and quite fruitful. <br /> <br /> Being somewhat self-confessed computer nerd, I just can not help but highlight the exact timeframe when the movie was actually made and how the graphics used reflect this time (1997). Playing Era Games cf. "Mind Grind" to give one example, this movie can not escape that 16-bit color low res multimedia blast at that time. Now, in the past few years, it has been somewhat less in the field of gaming, in favor of a real game. <br /> <br /> I have to resort to watching this film through the German FTA satellite channel (like I, I think it was sometimes broadcast on UK FTA television, not so recently), I was slightly amused when I saw , that Gottdog (God dog) had four people working on their design. Maybe it's like I like to have fun with this, given that it has been ten years since the film was shot, but the end result makes film graphics of the eighties look good compared. for the main story I agree that format is not the best idea. Like other people, I agree that Ada deserves a science-fiction movie, and that a more biographical approach would better fit the life story of this remarkable lady. There are basic mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this film. First of all, the basic idea that somehow lost information from the real world of the past can be accurately reconstructed using some extrapolation using intelligent software-based agents, it seems somewhat absurd. Also, the subject of a film that a computing device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg wind) is now known to be so. OK, so the Victorians could have this opinion, but the work of GÃ¶del of the 20th Century proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's work at the boundaries of computing, not to mention the theory of chaos and quantum mechanics, completely undermines these thoughts that seem to be key for that, the software should work. After clicking the mouse in the air means "programming" is also simply wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie might be fine, but at least some technical and scientific consultations would give the movie some much needed credit in credibility. But I will not forget the movie, but as "Pi", it is clearly unique work, but also many fatal mistakes that really please me, 3/10 from me.
