This film does not even deserve it. It was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not insulting, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is the one I think everyone should read. There is full frontal nudity and disgusting tongue. But not only that, there is no plot of plot, the actors are awful, the accents are horrible, the actors are little time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented it was Brian van Holt (who by the way got only the fifteenth part). I think it could have been a mistake in directors and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times and added only a new sentence. A movie similar to Eraser Head, perhaps the most disturbing film. There is no line of land and it is not funny. Even if it does not try to be funny. DO NOT USE ANY FILMS.
