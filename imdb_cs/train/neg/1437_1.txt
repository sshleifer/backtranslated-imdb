I missed the first ten minutes of this movie, but I do not think it looks from the beginning, it would make a difference. I thought the film was extremely dull and was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (like Roy Marsden) in great roles, but all disappointed because of a very poor screenplay. "Kind Solomon's Mines" ... a very short part of the movie inside "Down" was about as exciting as observing dry colors, and I doubt that even a preschool child would be spellbound by watching warriors fighting. "The entire film resembled a cheaply produced US television Give me Indiana Jones every day!
