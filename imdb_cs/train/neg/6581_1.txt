I rented a "new best friend" who hoped to have a movie similar to funny adolescent thrillers like "Gossip" and "The Curve." Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd," in which there is no excitement, and acting is incredibly fake. "New Best Friend" is boring and events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
