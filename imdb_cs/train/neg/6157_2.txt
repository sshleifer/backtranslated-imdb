Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights when I surfed the canals and came across this movie. For some names in the cast I would expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see that Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham is reduced to such a terrible part. I hope the money is worth it. And the students were talking about the fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or a terrible disaster. I think I'm fenced, it's fun, but I've never been that intense. The only reason I watched the whole movie was that the distance fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.
