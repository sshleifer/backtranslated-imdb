This movie must be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD! The storyline could click if the film had more money and writers to reduce the nonsense and sick scenes that my parents cautiously alert ... But the story is like a free cannon. If there was such a thing here as if it were film making - it would fly out of it. It reminded me of a lot of fast movies that were released in the 1960s, bad writing and filming scenarios. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the whole movie were the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the film could easily be made by high school children. I give this movie a rating of 1 because it is really terrible and left the whole family feeling cheating. My advice - do not look at it!
