Seriously, why do actors from America and Frechs who pretend to be Czechs have to speak perfectly English with a false Russian accent? I'm a man, so I enjoyed a carefree nudge - but fine porn movies would be more, and at least it would not have pretended it to be artistic. All political statements where the doctrinal painfully directs the subtlety? The game was also wooden and the melodramatic and comic relief was never funny. The figures were very shallow and I just did not know them. Bit, where I laughed, was when they were cutting actors in the archive footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the shot - just ridiculous. I have read many of Kundera's short stories (not the unbearable lightness of being) and are good things about his style of writing (though his subjects are one big fantasy of the male gender) - and I must say that the film did NOT EXPRESS any of Kunderas-style goodness.
