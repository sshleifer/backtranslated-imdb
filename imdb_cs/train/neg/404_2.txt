Shortly after watching this movie, I questioned the mental competencies of each actor and acting actor. Elizabeth Shue is a cheerful actress, why would she take such an overrated opportunity? I have to give credit where the credit is due. Some of the moments in the film were unpredictable and somewhat remodeling, but barely coincided with the brittle perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastia Cainea. I would not want to make this film to anyone, a man or a woman, who would have any form of self-confidence to look for.
