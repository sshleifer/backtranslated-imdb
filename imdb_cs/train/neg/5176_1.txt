When the film is independent and ungrateful, like Hamiltons, I was waiting for you to be out of the ordinary, releasing your heartbeat. I know good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, visited a web site, and even persuaded some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 for seeing this terrible movie. When the festival is called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, but the low expectations for the film were filmed in hell as soon as I saw an hour passed before we saw the finger's first finger coming from someone's finger. There were too many conspiracies and too much imagination. I'm sorry I do not see Happy Feet. I think there could have been more violence and gore in this movie than in Hamiltons!
