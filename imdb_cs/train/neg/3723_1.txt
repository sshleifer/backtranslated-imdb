The sects that use this film are well known by claiming to receive a "message" of the Bible without any change or mimobiblical influence. The existence of this film is due only to the fact that there is no such thing. If you want to know what was born of the rebirth of Christian science in the seventies, just look at the word "rapture" in the cult and cult dictionary. It's faster than sitting down with this celluloid waste. Weak actress, unequal sound quality, and a script that could easily be written by Jack T Chick (a paranoid theorist of a Christian conspiracy for the Evangelical scene). You could not really put it in the category "so bad it's good," so the only audience is either a pamphlet collection that wants to divide or an extremely paranoid one.
