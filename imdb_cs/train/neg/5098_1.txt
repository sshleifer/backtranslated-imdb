This must be one of the best annoyed anime shows. And yes, he even showed me the "end of Evangelion" and it still hated me. Not to mention the countless rip-off of this show! I do not mind psychological and philosophical untertones, but Evangelion pulls it into mud like nothing else! Many of the characters seemed very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Besides, most of the others were a lot of crazy losers. They need to go to the psychiatric center without piloting giant robots against foreigners called "angels." Even swords and alien battles did not help. There is something like that: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they're really cool because they bleed (!), When they get hurt but they're not really mecha, but they captured the angels, so they sometimes go crazy and they do not do what unnecessary pilots want, and they have to be better controlled ... blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. For those who love this series, you have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But on the thoses that have the "mind" obsession to think that everyone will like this series, you are more egotist. I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
