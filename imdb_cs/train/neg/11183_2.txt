"The people I know," is a boy with no root and no one cares - despite the gaming effort of the talented cast. <br /> <br /> Pacino delivers his usual tour de force like Eli Wurman, a mediator from the past who is exhausted by life moral damage. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma or his fate. The film deals with Eli's preparations for the benefit of a liberal political cause, while the distraction of the client (Ryan O'Neal, good in the signed part) of the latest "dirty linen" - in this case a television actress companion who has joined the bad people. Tea Leoni brings her usual starry power to this supportive role, though this time her script does not do much work. As Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger can make sympathy despite the unlikely plotting mechanics. This movie is exclusively for those who like to watch Pacino's stance on his stuff and enjoy the other principles. Unfortunately, between the script and the direction, "People I Know," is strictly amateur. That's why his limited theatrical release and quick trip to DVD. Consider a warning.
