Justin Timberlake (like Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is confused when the accused courtroom whispers "Thank you" witness LL Cool J (like Rafa) to the witness stand as she leaves the witness stand. In the introductory sequences of this movie, it gives you an explanation. You will see how Dylan McDermott (like Frances "Laz" Lazer) has decided NOT to NEVER DAMEN Dante Wayans (like Isaiah Charles). Edison police officers are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and flee. Whether she is going to her girlfriend (here called "Pussy") or winning Pulitzer, city corruption does not work well with Mr. Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption that reaches both unexpected and life threatening levels of danger. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film above the water, but hardly. LL Cool J will defeat Timberlake in the "pop-star to the movie star" charts (aka "rapper to actor" progress). Mr. McDermott is enjoying his role. The lending of gravitas to the management is strongly supporting actors Morgan Freeman (like Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (like Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Assault Assault and Tactical, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" plays Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (which seems to be lost). <br /> <br /> ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
