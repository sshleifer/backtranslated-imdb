Rosie had a lot of television time and talked about Tainos as if they were very influential in the modern Puerto Ricana dynamics. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spaniards were, and she knows it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen, looks like an average black cat black (with obvious black dads, cousins ​​and aunt) pretending to really recognize the true nature of what makes the modern Puerto Ricans, but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish speaks, food and music. It's so typical I lost her great respect and does not support anything else she does. Also, because she wants to dance around her African, she does not need more roles associated with darkness (Lackawanna Blues). Find next time Black Latina for the last time (thank you Zoe Saldan, Gina Torres, Gina Raver and Melissa DeSousa). To Puerto Rican here, which they say are African and not "black". ...Thank you. We "black" definitely have nothing to do with "you", so there is no lost love. But since you are probably in the States and you benefit from the civil rights movement, we would like to refuse any decent treatment of the man you received from the blood, sweat and tears from the walls of "blacks" you do not share with. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the portraits have a terrible image in the media, but we black people do not have time by trying to disrespect you because we know the media love to use the low points and behavior of all minorities to keep the mindless generalization . Obviously, you have gotten into the hype that you are white or better somewhere ... you are not. You also felt compelled to believe that black culture is BET ... you're wrong again and need a hood vacation. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Believe me, none of these black people want to claim your "culture".
