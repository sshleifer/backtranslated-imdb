What? Did you not know that Scooby-Doo was fighting the zombies? You may also not be aware of this little film, which was directed by Victor Halperin, who also ordered White Zombie four years ago. That would probably make her the second zombie movie. No, do not look for Dorothy Stone to reveal her breasts, as you would expect in most zombie movies, and you do not even find any brains are eaten. That's from 1936, you know. So what you see is typical of this period - lots of talk. You get to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and Bella Lugosi's eyes, but that's all about it. Zombie in Cambodia, really!
