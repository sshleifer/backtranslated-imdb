It was a film about infidelity and vengeance. Twins with a "twin" connection understand that something is happening to her sister. This movie takes forever to create a sketch. Plot that has been done many times. It was mostly foul. Once the plot joins, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with some abusive father. Father seems to prefer Ashley, so Laura will get it all. There is a promise that girls will never be separated from each other, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job in the dining room where she meets Barry, a married man. Naturally there is nothing good about it. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad apology for a way to watch him. I still waited for this movie to improve and somewhere to be a solution, but it never happened.
