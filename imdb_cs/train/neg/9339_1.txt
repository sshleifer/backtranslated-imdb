I thought they should call this movie "White" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... the sort of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed and think their life is so important ... give me a break. Such a lily white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in him, this movie was screaming for someone who really comes and steals it ... and so they pose to get that character even brighter than the rest of the cast (I thought is initially albino) to be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Intellectual Dishonest ... This film is a movie that can trick so many people to think it's useful because it has what's more ambitious. Better filling theaters with MI5-10 than with this demanding bull ... it had to be a better game because you can not fall out of the floor.
