I do not know what the Oscars had seen in this movie, but they had to see some pretty tough things to see in order to appreciate the best Oscar film. All I know is that luckily Gene Kelly played it, or it would be twice as bad as I think it is. First, I do not think Leslie Caron really was able to play such a role. She is not so talented, she is not a great dancer and she does not like it at all. It's a shame that an actor or an actress can ruin the movie just as he plays in it because if Leslie Caron was not in it, it could make a great movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all the things about Leslie Caron, just to criticize it, just say that because I think that's what's worse part of the movie. She is probably a good actress, but I can not say because I did not see it in anything else, but I think it was wrong at the Parník v Paříži. So if you want to see it, go on, but I tell you, it's better to look at "Singin" in the rain. "
