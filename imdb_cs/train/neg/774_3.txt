This movie looks like it was made by someone with some good ideas, but who has never done the movie before, nor did they think the script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and she was mistaken to think it would be funny. Instead, a silly conspiracy about mind control and so many flat, dysfunctional moments appeared. And to the beginning, Candy has released some of the worst lines I've ever heard. So despite the potentially entertaining gaming and storyline story, we remain with amateur and coarse film that is likely to be too stupid for the average adult, although adolescents are likely to find a few laughs. It's really shame - it could be much better. I think Eugen Lev, Joe Flaherty and John Candy should be beautiful.
