not a typical Wamp Story, not a pot stoker or anne rice here. a truly original vampire story. these vampires are genetic mutants that do not bother the sunlight. are pure evil. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. both leaders who play van helsing and rally vampyre cat are quite good. the film is heavily violent, which may cause some people to interfere. also it is loaded with scientific details that many will be hard to grasp and can get bored. I was sold for a clever story and some good performances. not to say how successful this movie would be if they had a bigger budget and got mass distribution
