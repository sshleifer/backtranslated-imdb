Black and white film. Good photos. Believable characters. <br /> <br /> I'm just terribly unnecessary. I had missed another perfect evening watching a movie that was rated "good" and "very good". There is some good acting and the back ground setting for the conspiracy is good (more should be done with this), but it is very slow growth and never evolves. This is the very foundation for sex without much romance with much needed nudity. More could be done with the main characters. If you're looking for something you could watch with in this movie and if you do not have trouble sitting there. Though this movie is only about 1 inches deep!
