Maybe Spoilers, maybe. I have to say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. In the first place, the film was filmed during the Disney sequel. It was created at the same time as "Little Mermaid II", "Jungle II Books" and "Peter Pan II" that were useless for the original film classics. (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I'll leave it because their original films have never really been a classic.) Let me go on and say that I'm fed up with good Disney movies and I I was absolutely adored by the original Disney "Cinderella." The sequel to "Cinderella" was a waste of time, the character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very different from the original girl I was born and watched as Cinderella was kind and lovely in the original. she had momentary moments with momentary phrases such as "I'm going to make this banquet my way!" that the new Cinderella (as she kindly named her) says, "Ewww!" This is anti-cinderella. I'm trying to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the servants, is good! why? They've done it all to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just scary family members for the poor Anasta Sia. My Question to the World: Did Disney people watch the original "Cinderella" when doing this sequel? Well, it certainly is not. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am everything for redemption and forgiveness, but in this film there was no reason to redeem Anastasia. In the first one, Anastasie was evil. The other is good. One simply can not leave such a story. I hope Disney will realize that this film, among other things, is the name of Walt Disney. Maybe now that Michael Eisner has disappeared, things begin to develop around the house of the mouse.
