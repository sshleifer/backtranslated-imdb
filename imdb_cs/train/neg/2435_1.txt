Here I warn you: I decided to believe those reviewers who said it was not an action movie in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on this basis and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> I'm here to tell you they were wrong. Totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, not completely; it is very disappointing if you were looking for an action movement, they were right about it. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not too bad, I think he is not worse than usual; but what does it have to Billy Zane in this? Was it some kind of death by the producers? How to make sure their movie is a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked. If they were really trying to succeed, then why not evaluate someone who could act? Yeah, and maybe go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. Oh, yes, and a director who knows how to drive. As someone who was sitting in this mess, he actually believed he would soon recover, I can assure you it never was. Damn it could be a good movie.
