They changed the name of this atrocities to unexpected love. The only thing worse is the film itself. The script contains a dialogue that would laugh at the choral recital of the third grade. At one point when my wife leaves her husband, she plays the bad cover All by Myself through the soundtrack! No fun. The actors are trying, but they are defeated by the awkward, incredibly terrible scenario. Direction is tremendously bad. No wonder life has such a bad reputation. How this happens. I'll turn on the TV before it's over!
