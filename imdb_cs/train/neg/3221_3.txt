I was looking at this tube last night. The involved actress first caught my attention. The first scenes were the attention. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film had gone away. If it was not for the start of the movie, I would stop looking. I was still watching them wanting to get together. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel it has never happened. Especially I did not like to extend the time when several characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was that the other shoes? I recommend? No, I do not think so. Since other reviewers report that most slang is dated (60th jive), but that was not disturbing. The whole end completely shut me off.
