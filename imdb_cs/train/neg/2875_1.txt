This is the biggest bite ever. It seems that they have spent more time, effort and money making DVDs than they do on real movie. I really thought the DVD was off with someone's home porn until I knew one of the actors out of the cover. This movie looks like someone has done a hundred bucks and a video camera and spent half of it on rats. The picture is really clear, but that along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography if you call it production, acting if it's what they are doing, and the script, if they have one, makes this movie look worse than old porn. At least old porn has a point. It just seems that some PETA members have gathered and have decided to make a really worrying, unnecessary PSA about the rights and the values ​​of animals. This is so unpaid money or time. It has nothing to do with the actual serial killer of the BTK other than the name of the killer and some of the victims. The people who shot this film should be glad they are not free yet, or they could come to them just because the film is so bad.
