From the very first moment I saw the cover of the film box and the shot of the photograph. I thought this boy, this boyfriend "Scwarz" must be like 6 feet or 6 feet. <br /> <br /> Not high 5 feet. No, that's his fault. <br /> <br /> In each review, I filmed the film on a cold night in Tucson, on the second story on the deck with a good cigar and let it spin. At that time, my wife had a matter and things went to me, so I needed a good diversion. But as bad as the movie ... I liked it very well, also with the Merlot lamp, I would admit it. <br /> <br /> I really watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good! It's not like trying "too hard" to be cool or "so close" that it would hit the mark for an action movie ... It's furious. And then really clueless. Then he's furious again. It's the best of the best when it comes to a scene with a slow rate of persecution. Wow !! In my life, I never felt safer. Warm and happy. I was grateful that during the persecution they kept on gasoline due to smaller production in the summer months ... In the direction of "non-inspiration" actions and battle sequences had to be choreographed, or re-choreography and tightening, the sound was out of reach was not hit, it just he went on, on the contrary. The "locals" of this village they were in, the city was rather "off", they did not seem to watch what was going on very well, it looked and even "stared" into the camera lens. Just like a deer in the main lights something like that, just some of them smiling, smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because 'Columbu' I just bet she has a good heart and caring spirit for people in America as well as for her countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, the "island of Baretta" is very lethargic and incredible. I even like it a lot. My x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I'm quite discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even love. Overall, I love Franco. That's it. <br /> <br /> As a movie adding an addition to this if you want to kill a few hours with really fun watching, directly on video-B movies or 'bad' movies for your little library collection then if you find a look at "The Big Sweat "(1991) with Robert Z 'Dar ... you know a big guy from' TANGO & CASH '. "Big Sweat," a police bomb without real plot recognition and acting that is so poor, it could also be "on the crutches" and at the end of the "Big Sweep" I think they did not get the money because they had a picture of the cast and just lit him and let him burn during credits. -Good entertainment. But overall, not as good as the island of Baretta, I gave him "1" and the overall rating "terrible" for the terribly good B movie. I'm waiting for the sequel, perhaps as "Barett's revenge on Montazum" (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets poorly on the water, declares war on the water what.) Or "Barett's Powder War" where he will be a big drug master in his country and chemically link genes and to create a hybrid of super insects that would be reared and dropped into cocaine fields and eat coke, and after crawling through this error, it creates a chemical reaction that rotates coke to pure powdered sugar. Then another sequel would have to get young people to save themselves from too much sugar dependence and so on. He could get a substantial toothpaste company to support and partially fund the project with a careful placement of the product into this function. Right?(*)
