Once again, Disney can create a children's film that completely ignores its background. The only thing that is common with this and the original Gadget cartoons are names. The most obvious mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has fallen from the figure on fancy support, Dr. Claw is more a shot than an evil villain, etc. But it's more than that. Horrors start from the first minutes of the film, as Gadget, as a security guard named John Brown, will not help identifying him as a classic Inspector Gadget. And right from the start, we see Disney's glamorous attempt to make every story always a love affair between a man and a woman - they represent Brenda, which only serves to make Disney movie compatible. Add to that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you will see that it will not be near the original scene anywhere. What would help make it better to replace it - but as you thought, Disney failed in it too. The whole movie is just a Gadget that acts stupidly because of the stupidity and taste of Brenda. As if an insult was added to the wound, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look like, does not work or does not think like old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just a canonical picture of "comic relief". Disney, of course, admitted that Gadget cartoons were comedies, so they shot the film as a comedy, but they took out all the smart running gags (like the exploding paper) and replaced them with the Gadget, Gadgetmobile is a wise ass, and "Claw" performs. Someone should tell Disney that "baby film" does not mean "an absolute lack of brain use". The gadget should be aimed at children 10-12 years ... not children 10-12 months like this movie. Whether this movie is supposed to be, it is not, repeat NO, a real inspector gadget. Because I like the old Gadget, I hate it.
