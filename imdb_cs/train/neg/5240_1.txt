Once it reaches the screen, it will destroy all the intelligent forms of life around! But on behalf of his producers I must say that he does not belong to any famous film, deserves a whole new feature! It's a "neurological drama"! It's sad and depressing every neuron within the human brain. <br /> <br /> It is the closest thing that ever gets into a stroke without really suffering it. He runs you without speaking, all your members are dulled, your mouth is open and it stays the way, and the most natural sign of everything is that you go blind and deaf. <br /> <br /> No small performance of such a kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to my mind that I have finished my exam is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
