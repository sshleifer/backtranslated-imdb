Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. When was Hollywood ever a successful film that invaded the Republicans? Why not learn? Dixie chickens do not. These Leftas live in their own elite bubble and interact with each other; that most of America is much more correct than they are. The best Hollywood productions are not guerrilla and are rarely political. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's Cheney mockery was bad. I wanted to think that Cussack could land better movies. It was not funny.
