I'm not entirely sure why I clicked on "contains a spoiler" because it's quite frankly not enough explanation in the movie to find out enough about what to do to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Visually, it usually brings. Well, except what happened in the 1980s. Let me tell you, before I noticed, I never saw Lord Band, nor knew anything about their bar that they won Eurovision. Monsters seem to be members of the band, almost in their personality. It does not matter. Anyway, I did not know when watching. I thought monsters / demons were mostly capable. Just about. I'm pretty sure that what we see on the screen is a semisegenerative explanation, but maybe it would be better not to know it. It would probably be incredibly poor to think about it. The action will keep it in sufficient quantity to make the audience have fun, although half of the fun factor is joking about whether to wtf make the movie exactly. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I laughed out of it, especially as he explains nothing. It must be the mood I was in, but I found it funny for some reason. Then I look at the movie on the internet and find out NOBODY knows what the hell to be. That made me entertained and increased the score by another half point to 4/10. It's not frightening or particularly coherent, but it's pretty pretty visually and audibly. Overall, far from basic but observable. Do not wait too long and do not expect it to make sense and you might be amused if you are in the right mood.
