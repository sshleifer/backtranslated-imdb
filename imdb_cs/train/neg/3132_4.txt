I did not see such a wonderful rating on IMDb, but I still saw it because I am a great fan of Bible related material. The first thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones, but it also seemed that Casper Van Dien did not see those Jones movies (but should). I believe he did his best, but the screenplay was just goodbye. Music was also trying to be Jones' style. Great work, but for such a movie it looked like too much work, just as the video part did not deserve all the great music. Robert Wagner did his best acting skills, did a good job, but the script somehow brought everything. "Jokes" are an old school, some 20 years old; only a cynical smile came into my face. There are really bad angels cameras, SFX looks like home and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good story about the story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things did not work out. Maybe he should put it on the paper when he was still fresh in his head. When I saw (in the first few minutes) that the movie would be one of those "low-budget films", I was hoping to at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the films would just disappoint.
