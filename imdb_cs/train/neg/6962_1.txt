How could these good actors, such as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet, get involved in such ... and ... such a thing? I can not understand. It was terrible, very crazy to play (but some of the few leading roles), jokes are stupid and absolutely not fun ... I will not talk more about this movie except one little thing: it will be a waste of time and money.
