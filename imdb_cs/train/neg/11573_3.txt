I came here last night before I decided which television movie was going to settle down in front of us, and those I found did make it look as if it was not. How wrong is how I feel! <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be noted that it is a daily home cinema. The performances are wooden, each sentence is an attempt to "painful" the way home movies and bad soap operas are always based on the predictable and well-established assumption that men (especially soldiers) are essentially violent and uncompromising. The whole movie is a "track" that is obvious when men are threatening to build a second dimension. If it sounds pleasant (or even pleasant) then they warn you. Linda Hamilton's German accent, although pretty good, is painfully disturbing - just like her face, for some reason. Other performances are undoubtedly a constant source of embarrassment for their perpetrators, whose painfully thin and obvious characterization is the order of the day. There are a few surprises, but beware of the "endless supply of food and drink" Monty Pythonesque, which miraculously appeared from the backpacks of hungry soldiers! I did not expect it to be an action, but I was hoping it was beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. What I received was a particularly bad Christmas "feeling" that will have a smart audience that will catch everyone. 2: You are a fan of predictable "housewives with men and winning" television movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate the true story is when Hollywood turns into a feature film. 4: You have already bottled enough nog that your emotions are easily understood by simple storytelling.
