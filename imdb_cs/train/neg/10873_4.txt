Many people think it's a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on the ground and some strangers escaped from the spacecraft, then hey killed some people on the ground, but without reason. It's also in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days the predator got to the ground, but no one had sent him signals before, he did not know what happened on the ground, so there is a contradiction. Predator finally found the Aliens Director and killed them for no reason. He was not alive on Earth, he was not one of his things about what had happened. Finally, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short, and it can not tell the speakers clearly about the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not think it's a good movie.
