Because in acting, etc. There was nothing wrong, written for the episode is for this series a phantom or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see a Martian hunter. You must know that in the middle of the sixth series no matter what happens, it is not true what is going on and really does not bring anything to the story about the series except to meet the Marshan hunter again and lose it for 30 minutes. by far another case of bad writing in the series of small theaters. I really enjoy the show, but mainly because of the cast and three or so good episodes every year, but who is sometimes on a cast who works or uses to work on soaps must be preserved. It was by far the worst. In the first 4 minutes you know that what is happening is false and everything that's happening is a dream based on Clark's impact apparently caused by a phantom zone and when he wakes up, he wins and blah blah so writers must really make a villain, which will continue this story this week. May also added another villain who died in the last episode in which he was a hunter of the Martian men and made him fly again, or he came back and told Clark that he had forgotten his sunglasses to get close as it was in this episode, and calls her the day.
