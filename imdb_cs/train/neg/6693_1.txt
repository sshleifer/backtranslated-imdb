Run away from this movie. Even according to film standards B, this movie is terrible. It's also a nasty topic. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect are cool and admired. People who treat others with respect are lost. Guncrazy is a film that talks about liberated French much better than this film, it sees it instead. <br /> <br /> No normal kid would do what Trent does. State soldiers do not work the same way as in this movie, etc. When you see this movie, you can realize why writers use golden golden clich√©s. Mija is a completely dissatisfied shaft, which she did, she had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that viewers can not identify her with her. <br /> <br /> There is usually one thing that the film can recommend, in which case there is no one. It's such a ridiculous film that offends anyone who tries to identify with the main characters. The act is an adequate B-film standard and the direction is nothing new or interesting.
