What the hell was all about? I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most beautiful movie ever shot. What the Brothers Wachowski had to do about this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy that you can not guess. Basically, this whole movie was a burden to talk and do not do me wrong, I have no problem with tawny movies, but everything that spoke in The Matrix Reloaded was an unnecessary load. Then there would be a combat sequence that lasted too long, then even more unnecessary rides, then another combat scene that took too long and it all puts the greatest anti-top. A small bearded kid talking a charged incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. Keanu Reeves also has the worst performance yet. I knew he was not a good actor, but this is a prank. If you watch his movies in the order he was in, they seemed to be getting worse. God knows what his performance is like in something he has to give! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden plank that has ever become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film it came as a massive dissapointment. If you have not seen the first movie yet, I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time with this whole heap of turd. <br /> <br />
