the director's intention for these films is quite honest, but his history of his productions has made me realize that it could get into the core as if it were done by other filmmakers. preserving his great 30-day television series, but also counting on the production of MTV "I bet you will," which opposes his earnestness in any matter he demonstrates, and also counts on his somewhat unsatisfactory production, "lift me" hopes high. Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me. just as with "exaggeration" after a while I asked myself what exactly was all. the main concept is clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the time is filled with unnecessary things and repeatedly repeated something that was previously or somehow shown in the movie so it is exhausted and extremely dull.
