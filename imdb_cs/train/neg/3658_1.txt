In spite of the slightly sophisticated features of the script and the overall value of the film's curiosity, Fury of the Wolfman appears as a boring, uninteresting excursion to lycanthropy, rescued only by the statue of Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including the Naschka hammock, are full depreciation (although of course nobody often helps shameful dubbing). Although the script deals with enough variations on the themes of the werewolves / Frankensteina / Dr Moreau, which make up twelve films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterization is so weak and the dialogue so stupidly absurd (at least in English) that the latent interest in turgid management is soon over. <br /> <br /> Zab√°lz's shift seems to be jarring, even amateur. His production is clumsy and ineffective. It did not help him with a lot of bright lighting at Villasenor. Even the promising series are filmed so inappropriately that the director has few attempts to give fears to the audience, they are signaled far ahead <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar pattern of carelessness, although a strictly convincing musical score and a sadly crude, totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
