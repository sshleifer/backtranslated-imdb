Hi, if you have an hour before you kill and find the color too exciting, I suggest it. If you like cheap b-movies like me, it's good for giggling! Besides, I would not suggest that you rent it, I would expect the tube to return at about 4 am on the free channel of your cable / satellite supplier. The band that made this soundtrack by the way was about two years after the movie, and it did not sound as bad as two small town reviews I could find. So again good if you come across the grass growing on a lot of fun but good to watch if you want to see how NEVER to shoot a low budget movie.
