Potential film extravagance, which arose during the 19th century, failed to produce. With great names like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason why the movie could fail. The film, however, missed the end, had a justifiable excuse for the conspiracy line, and collapsed into continuity. The typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, coupled with love and destroyed by beauty (or inadequacy) and disagreement, has a touching attitude towards the premature death of a mother and an absent father. The father who plays Finney is a disturbed man, his daughter's suffering in life and death. He believes his daughter's lack of good looks would destroy his fortune by taking them under their social status. The actors tried vainly to save what was happening. Washington Square is the black hole of destruction and destruction, losing the precious time of those who look sad. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, purely for actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay out of Washington Square.
