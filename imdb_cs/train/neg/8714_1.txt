I just could not stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly entertaining and stupid! But it does not matter, it's very fun! In this movie you do not have to pay attention! The effects are the same - LAME! Dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my saw a stick holding T-Rex's head for a moment.) Predators are the same from Carnosaura 2, T-Rex is the same, but ... in some scenes his head looks a little stuffed and looks like it like some project failure from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, in fact, I'm talking about quick editing, editing it so fast we do not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! until late, they are rubber! Well, it's just interesting to see Rick Dean in this sequel. What can I say ... do not borrow it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
