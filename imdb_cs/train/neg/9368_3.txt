Oh, a vague actress in a movie where she plays a mother with a child. It's mentioned on BBC 1 at half-night, wondering if ... it's TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give it to TVM's producers, not happy with making one average movie, they mostly give us two average films where two themes blend together and NEVER NEVER hide. The first topic is the woman in danger of a thematic cross being beaten by a woman who suffers from the pain of divorce, which means we have the scene of a hero who survived the attempted murder, followed by the scene when her son Sam asks why she divorced herself? And when TVM answers, the reason is "people are changing" rather than saying something like "I'm a real slapper" or your dad is going through men's public toilets for sex "as it happens in divorce cases in real life. that young Sam, whom I like, not only his parents divorced, but he is as thick as two short planks, since he is so stupid he does not deserve any sympathy because he does not realize the toilet is a drug dealer, they do not know you could die if someone shot you and did not know that Love Lucius was painfully unhappy If our own childhood was as innocent as Orwell said: "Ignorance is power." Sam is suddenly a marine expert, it's nature of development or bad scripting? I know what my money is and wondering that Sam boys genuis did not notice that if the story is set in 1994 then why people often wear clothes, drive t cars and ride trains from the 1950s, it turns out during the conspiracy it's the mother who is a dummy, then there's the last plot of the fence that left me like an idiot to watch
