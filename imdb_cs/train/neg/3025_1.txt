this movie is really bad ....... I do not really mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. of all the films he has made, I am just the enemy of the state, besides being one of the worst directors of all time. The most horrifying thing about me is Richard Kelly (director Donnie Darko) who made the script for it. Richard Kelly is in my eyes a genius, but to get involved in it, I hope he has learned his lesson. Now I like the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I can not do it the way he does, because of that terrible story and appearance. do not do me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he did several accidents in his time, and that's one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knights, I think it's a little overvalued. I just can not feel for her in the movies. The whole movie is bad. that's it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
