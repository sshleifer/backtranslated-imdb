I also saw this film on a local screening about a year ago. First of all, I'll say it great. Cassella is an incredibly talented and fantastic cameraman. I just wish the movie was as good as it looks. I would not call it a horror movie. Inserting several shots of a decaying spirit does not make it a horror movie. There is no secret, there is no tension, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the movie. The acting was all right, I think, but nothing special. And the slogan "Revenge can be fatal" ... really? ... should you check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have exactly the same tagline? <br /> <br /> That pain tells me some of this, but I know many people who worked on this movie and I know they do not want people to blow smoke up their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
