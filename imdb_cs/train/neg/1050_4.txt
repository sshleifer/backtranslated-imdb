Nathan Detroit runs illegal games for NYC high-level warriors but the heat is turned on and can not find a safe place. He charges Chronicle Sky Masterson that Sky can not make the prime missionary, Sarah Brown, to go to dinner with him. Sky gets a challenge, but both men have some surprises in the stores. It's one of those precious fifty MGM musicals in splash-colored color, with big sets, loud music, bigger than life and performance to match; Broadway photographed on the big screen if you like things I do not have. My main problem with these types of movies is just music. I love all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but the Broadway show of the melody in a swinging time with an endless pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet at the end of every fourth bar is not my cup of tea. This was written by Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on several of Damon Runon's stories), and while the plot is very nice, the songs are weak. For example, Blaine's two numbers are identical, unnecessary, do not recommend storyline and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic when it bothers you). There are only two unforgettable melodies, Luck Be A Lady (Sung Down, Rockin 'The Boat), but you have to sit for two hours. The film's trump card is young Brando gives thoughtful, relaxed performance; he also sings quite well and even a little dancing and is evenly connected with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which both escape to Havana for the night is a welcome departure from Noo Yawk's noise, bustle and murder. Fans of musical artists can dig it, but in my opinion the musician must do more than just film the scene.
