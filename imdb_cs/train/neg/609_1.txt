It was a terrible movie. Do not be tempted by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but that must be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem the pointless story of this film. This film is an American propaganda work in the early nineties. The toughest scenes were those in which Colombian insurgents produced their cases of revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared to be a fake, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that had no real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are such films, the devastating actor is like Christopher Walken's good name. I could hardly sit.
