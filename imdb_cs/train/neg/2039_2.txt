This movie was almost unbearable. I can see that it looks like it was shot by a home video camera and that this film should be about weeks in time, but the characters will not change clothes once, but the acting broke the fourth wall a bit for me. I saw a better acting game in the 4th grade. In addition, the conspiracy is unrealistic. If the man suspected of turning the boy around, I was also very disappointed that all the murders were done with a gun. It's not copycat Zodiac did not kill just a gun, the authority would know it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, when it is the title of a book that serves to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this film is not such a movie that could be done with a low budget at least as low as it could or could make sure they had better actors or more gore. Lots of people went on a low budget trip without having to use the horrific actors on Easy Rider, which had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
