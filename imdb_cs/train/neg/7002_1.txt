I saw the movie and the other one. The trinity is my name and I find that this is worse than the first one. I have no idea why they even shot another movie, it was stupid and unnecessary to regret having everything. I went through them several times, and it still leads me to shut it off for five minutes. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. If it had a different storyline or at least more plot and more comedy, it could be fun and it's worth the $ 5 I've spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I would say that you will save money and you will not leave this movie or any of those who go with it, believe me in this.
