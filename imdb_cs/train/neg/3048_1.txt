This is perhaps the worst speech of Santa Claus ever committed to a medium, whether it be a book, a picture or a movie. Santa looks to be looking down on the kids, and the twisted tale of Merlin brings him to help him defeat one of Satan's servants, Pitch does nothing better. It's ridiculous to say the least, with bad effects, even for the standards of 1959. If the child looked at this film, he would have nightmares and never wanted to visit Santa. They will be scarred all their lives. Imagine the boy is in the "Christmas Story" when they start screaming after being laid on Santa's lap. That would be the case if the boy saw it.
