It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I really can not remember when I saw a worse movie. I thought it was about an accident investigation. What really happened was a soap opera and a bad thing. The "conflict" tab has faded to the extreme. The first hour or so looks like a screaming match, with some unlikely scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs if you do not use "conflict". <br /> <br />
