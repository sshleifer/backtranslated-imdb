I saw this movie titled "Tied Up". I generally enjoyed Dolph's movies, so I tried it. It's not worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about boxing, which attracts the audience. Do not be fooled. This is the worst movie. Effects do not exist. A plot that is little is very predictable. The movie in places seems to be chopped together. This just smells again. Nor did he pay the price of cheap rent. As a bit of a Dolph fan I was still waiting for him to see him in action. By the end of the movie you will still be waiting. It is best to avoid this movie and spend time watching almost anything else.
