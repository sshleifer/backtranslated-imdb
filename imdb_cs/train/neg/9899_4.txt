The ridiculous film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with Pastor Joan Bennett's daughter. His brother Derek is an opponent for Ms. Bennett's affection. When Mr Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He has to kill a whale and win Bennett ... There are several scenes that can have an enthusiastic theater audience in 1930; especially scenes that Barrymore is losing. However, the film did not grow old; there are much better movies from the 1920s as silent and thirties tones. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not the best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
