OK, let me first say that I am still surprised by the plot, but again it is a film that continues in Steven Segal only without Steven segal omg !!! /> <br /> Just a random low budget action scene really no point I'm still amazed I burned 90 min on this bullshit really! <br /> <br /> just rent a movie Jacky Chan or go see wwf more fun and does not and does not assume he does not and is going !!! plz plz plz avoid! btw best actor plays there Bill Goldberg and it says a lot !! and not that it does not play well, as I said plz avoid it pfff i still can not believe I'm useless 90 min and spent 10 minutes more writing this! :)
