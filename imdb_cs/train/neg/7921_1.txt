The mission of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what remains to be different from other films, consists of strange aliens. I'm convinced that this film will be # 1 the worst IMDb movie - if someone really watched it. The conspiracy is disconnected, and it does not make sense in a few (too many) cases. The real miracle is why this sequel has been created on such an unsuccessful and terrible (but still a bit better) movie. I recommend this movie if you like watching horror movies for a good laugh.
