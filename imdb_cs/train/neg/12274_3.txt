Usually I'm not the one to say that the film is not worth the attention, but it is certainly a mitigating circumstance. Cornelia Sharpe is the only true lead of this film, which looks rather attractive and the fact that this film is really short. The story in the movie is incredibly boring and virtually anywhere in the movie. None of the characters are interesting at all, and there is no reason to be interested in anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery on Earth decided to make this film, but he definitely had to pass it. The only reason I saw you see this movie is when you die - a great fan of Sean Connery, and he just wants to see everything he did. Save it last. <br /> <br /> Well, if it's a miracle across my review (or some of the other reviews on this page), I hope you like it more than I did. Thank you for reading.
