It was an impulse for me from a local videotape. Do not make the same mistake I made. This film is boring, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly badly written and published; I wanted every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper does a few sparring performances and is his usual unconnected self; his role was obviously not a part of him. And although the movie is probably based in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a Hollywood film a lot; all the main characters are Caucasian and some tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Strange. Anyway, when you see it in the field of your local department store, keep walking.
