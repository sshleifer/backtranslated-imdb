I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy the dirty horror movie for what it is. But it really takes badness for new extremes. It's a flimsy conspiracy for what never really goes anywhere and takes time. There are no shocks, no horror, no tension, just a load of guys that shakes an hour and a half and then they run quickly. Bat on the hot horror genre to avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
