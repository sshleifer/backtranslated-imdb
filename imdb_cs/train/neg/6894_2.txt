It's sad to see what the movie is trying to do, and it's obvious that it was not far behind the brand. Film students should take it as a lesson and warning. The graduate has some idea. He wants complete control. So he writes, controls, produces his own cinematographic masterpiece himself. Usually, his concept is far behind his budget. Usually he writes a hidden script full of each line of tags he can come up with. He is usually interested in a magnificent story rather than the stupidity of working with actors in individual scenes. It usually ends up with a movie that is weak when it tries to create miracles on a small budget. It usually ends with a series of meetings (we can not fix them by calling them scenes) that feel as if they were written at the age of 12. And usually end up with poorly running scenes that the viewer is missing. When you look at judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it's just a usual fare.
