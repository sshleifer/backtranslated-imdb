I do not know much about the movie, but good movies have to tell a story ... your characters must start and finish their journey. The last exit to Brooklyn may, but it is not in any satisfactory way, and I do not mean a happy end, just any end. The last trip to Brooklyn, which was in Brooklyn in 1952, during a very brutal strike, sets a series of stories in motion. They are mostly some of the most popular characters ever going through the movie screen. But the last trip to Brooklyn can not bring these stories to any conclusion ... some of them hang endlessly or break into some bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" end. Two cases at the point, and contain spoilers. The sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie) is hit by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie ... he's gone for the good, erased from everyone's memory ... no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, a silly, clueless and secretly homosexual leader who was rejected by his homosexual mistress found himself murdered by his neighbors. The final scene of beating shows Brooklyn Street and street lights are very, very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene stretches further and further and ... and the camera stretches down to the labor leader's body and was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And, of course, it's also for him ... erasing the brain ..... away. <br /> <br /> The lower line .... no matter what the reviewers originally mentioned in 1989 about this movie ... This film is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid it. And if you are not warned in advance, it really deserves the NC-17 rating for a massive amount of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... and even let the teenagers watch.
