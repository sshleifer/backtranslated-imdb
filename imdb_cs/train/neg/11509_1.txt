I do not know what some of you are smoking, but I think it's strong. To call "Lighten", terrible would be an insult to the very notion of horror. The game is hideous and I do not choose Madonna here, we all know it is useless, but someone else has to warn her that her illness is contagious. My back literally hurts to make it so thin on the poorly delivered lines. Editing is so unobtrusive, it is described. Photos and compositions (which at that time had the power to be awarded for any budget movie) are incredibly awkward, even lighting is terrible and unnatural. These are the basic elements of filmmaking, if they do not do the right thing, you should look for another job. Just like in the 3rd Grade Snow White, it's as if it were not what it would become or was interesting. The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, greatly crafted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste sea salt and feel the wind in your hair. Sexual tension is real and immediate ... those of you who have found the verse Guy Ritchie should see it, it's really one of the dominant cinematography. Those of you who thought it was a remake are some masterpiece that should investigate your heads.
