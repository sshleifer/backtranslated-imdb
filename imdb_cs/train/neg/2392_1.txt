Actually, we watched it twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we forgot something ... nope, what was missing was left out of the beginning of pre-production. In fact, I went back to Robbin's novel to find out if I could find the problem, and found that what I thought was fun and exciting is now just as much disconnected and unclear junks. <br /> <br /> So the initial problem with the movie decided to do it at all, and the rest of the train debris went from here. Absolutely nothing works - it's not a blessed thing. Some exquisite outdoor photos come into the steam location by accidentally placing the camera in the interior. All actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively calmed down - with the exception of Rain Phoenix, who seems to be too unconscious to realize how awful her performance is. The dialogue is one, long and unwavering. Scenes are meaningless from seconds to seconds and there is no connection between them. Still, the movie blindly starts, convinced that it says something deep. That's too bad to even laugh; it's just unbearable. Gus Van Zant has done other good to great movies that I recommend you to see, and I am happy that he survived (and seems to have learned from) this mess.
