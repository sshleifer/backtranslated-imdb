I thought this movie was strange. From the very beginning, I thought it was extremely difficult to enjoy this movie and I think a little after that, I can quite clearly determine the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love pieces (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies we've ever shot), there's a pretty miscastast and although I can not imagine a life that would be better, I'm sure someone could having his place quite easily and filming this movie. Everything else is fine, except the stones of a faint comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. He just suffers the only thing .. Jean-Marc.
