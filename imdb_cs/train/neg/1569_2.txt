Weak land, unlikely car failure and helpless bumble characters. At first I thought that this film was created in the 1970s, because image quality, as well as drama and drama, looked from the old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found that it was really done in 1997, I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst and least thriller films I've ever seen. If you read this, you should note that if you see, you are wasting time if you could do something more exciting than watching a dry color.
