One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seems to be no middle position for the views of Love Story; one either loved or hated him. It seems, however, that this is a remarkable division of opinion in the scale from 1 to 10. For me this film is rated 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations and Ray Milland will turn into a wonderful job like Oliver's father. The film, however, did not make a particularly convincing task to tell its story, and the story was not so unique that it would require more insights, at least not for me. Maybe I'm a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet - because most of them, but not everyone, are ruined by his presence. The lone exception is What is Doctor ?, in which his direct performance is a perfect underlining for the protagonist of the game of Gofobra Barbra Streisand - and not by chance, he takes a shot of Love Story to a good level! McGraw and O'Neal have a tendency to get to their own lines rather than to do so. This film is remarkable for the beginning of a good career: it was the first film by Tommy Lee Jones.
