Nothing will destroy the movie just as a combination of bad scenario and bad direction. This is the case of "Mumie's Tomb." The script is the rest of the thoughts of older, better Universal horror, such as "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". Direction is sad and obsolete. The game is average. Even Charen's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler in "The Mummy's Hand" and the producers are stupid enough to add a footage of the incredibly better predecessor of Christy Cabanna and show the weakness of his own movie! Universal has realized how bad this film is, and basically two years later he has repaired the "Spirit of the Mummy" from a much better script and a better director. The result was probably the best film in his four-movie "Mummy," though nowhere else, as well as Karl Freund's originals of 1932. Kabanne records this movie at 3. The "new" stuff is 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably happy to see their characters bounce off, so they did not have to show up in that shot!
