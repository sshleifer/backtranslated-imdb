I think it proves that Joe Don Baker will do anything for the money. The concept of the film was not very good. This movie has so many bad things that I do not know where to start. The game is terrible. Cinematography is at best marginal. Soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended up at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote it and I can not believe that 9 people actually thought this movie was excellent. They had to like two dancers. The ultimate righteousness would be if they blocked this arson in a vaulted film at Wichita and never let anyone see it again! 1 out of 10 reviews are much better than they deserve.
