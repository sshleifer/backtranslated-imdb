In my opinion, I was not really a spoiler, but I still wanted to cover it. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 or less items, the film with the intent of indie-feeling, and only be absorbed in the mentor / be-all-to-you-can-be theme. He plays the alternate space half-empty version of the real Morgan Freeman, who is transferred to the old Econovan from the boy to Carson, CA from Brentwood to explore his next film role. Why Carson is a mystery for So. Cal of the inhabitants. He could save his way and went anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is a nice watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, who plays a disgruntled box office on a large but slow local market, apparently the source of Morgan Freeman. His character is known only as "he" to mention how actors are considered when average people meet in real life - "Psst, that is" he ", etc. Unfortunately I was too scattered that he had all kinds of secular wisdom but had no reliable return to his home in Brentwood, borne no money or debit card, or wisdom to keep his cell phone with him. If one has such a high opinion of himself that he believes he has an answer to everything he does , then I can see the cash and Blackberry, showing intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve such a big ego that she definitely has changed in their encounters with others, creeps up with the idea of ​​adultery, but then it has gone mad, this was like Shopgirl Steve Martin without a sexual affair; for Freeman, this was decent and not convincing the audience.
