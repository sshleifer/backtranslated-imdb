It was pointed out the now deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned of a scene that recalls the NYC terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. I hope someone who does that will read this warning. In spite of an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye," co-producer Arnon Milchan jointly produced Oscar nominated "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won the Oscar for "Gandhi"), Touch ", which was a cumbersome, unintentional excitement of laughter. It was misguided, horribly written and committed. She attempted to exploit the 70s of the genre of telekinetic thrillers. The movie will fail in many numbers. Consider "Carrie" and undervalued "The Fury" (both directors Brian DePalma). These were two fun and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject.
