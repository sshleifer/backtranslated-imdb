Veronica Mars' biggest secret is not one that should be on the screen. Rather, it is a mystery why this persistent disappointment is still in the air. This week was for Veronica Mars nadir: 146 out of 146 concerts were placed at Big 6 (soon Big 5 will be). Yes, you are reading correctly. Veronica Mars was defeated by every show now defunct WB and every show on UPN. It was defeated by all Fox shows and, of course, all shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. Now hypers hypers will say: but it was again. But everything on the television that week was quite re-run! This disturbs the mind why CW chooses this proven disappointment as one of the few shows it has saved from UPN. <br /> <br /> Apparently something is happening behind the scenes. Have fun exchanging and influencing. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what's the next explanation? "Veronica Mars has a potential" line is obviously dead when she's two years old to make sure she could not. <br /> <br /> It may be the influence and influence of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm on the brink of why someone would decide to spend their influence on a bad show that no one sees. <br /> <br /> A great secret and a very unfavorable debut for CW.
