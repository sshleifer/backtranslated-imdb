Abandoned with the capital "A". It must be one of those, if not dysfunctional, on TV right now. I'm like an anti-bush how it gets, but this show does not even smile at me. What you think of Bush's President has absolutely nothing to do with whether you like this piece of crap. "Jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil Bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!" Nothing funny. Is it even a joke? The ads that were shown in the weeks that led to the show were more fun than the show itself, and that's sad. Let's hope he does not even care about the second season. It should not be the first.
