The country's family run - perhaps with a nod to "ordinary people" - is about a young boy who surrendered after he had mortally wounded his older brother in shooting. In spite of the unfavorable subject (due to Christopher Cain's unfortunate ugly treatment), there is some dynamism in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of grown-ups to take care of this situation make the film a complete experience. What about Robert Duval, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the film is the film almost a small scale of the reunion "The Natural". It is a shame that this project did not get the necessary talents behind the camera to really make a breathtaking, unforgettable picture. * 1/2 from ****
