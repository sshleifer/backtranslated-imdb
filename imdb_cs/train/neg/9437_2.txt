I have never really considered myself a "student" when I look at watching movies, looking at them, creating opinions, and that's it. But Unhinged changed it all. This movie is undoubtedly the most dangerous film attempt I have ever seen. Every kid who moves to university and thinks he will be another Spielberg or Tarantine must be given a film called "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no story, the filmmakers were not competent enough to shoot a movie that is worth watching. It was a moment I saw it, but I can only say I'm looking at the director who is in the top scene. It never ends! It's almost like tooth extraction, just not so funny.
