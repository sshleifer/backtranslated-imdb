Acting is good, women are beautiful, and men are nice, so if you're looking for gentle porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting time. Motivation of the main characters, especially eponymous leadership, is often a secret. She could just tell the truth - the truth that was introduced in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared the time in prison for the rape he had committed. She was protecting her father, who had just risen in the middle when he was instigated in an evil trial? She protected herself when her reputation was suddenly worrying when it seemed that she had only her art so far? During the rehearsal, this highly willing woman turns before our eyes. On the contrary, her lover, who begins as a narcissist blockbuster, becomes a selfless hero during the process. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices for love. Of course, since no good deeds must remain without punishment, we will tell them that they will never see it.
