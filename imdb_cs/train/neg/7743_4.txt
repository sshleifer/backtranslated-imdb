This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. It's a combined police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are investigating shootings at the hip hop club. <br /> <br /> This plot is conceived and there are too many side problems. Ford (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school, where his youngsters swim in their spare time, both are being investigated with internal affairs, Ford is twisting their ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin), IA investigator, and she's a psychic who has a radio show, the man who set the killing in the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
