This film wants to work out that criminals are a product of modern society. That's why thieves, rapists and murderers (Killer of this film, Carl Panzram (James Woods), all three and even worse) can be fully responsible for their deeds? An interesting concept, but very difficult to transfer to the screen intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And this is where Killer: Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film tries to bring Panzram's behavior into perspective, with a retrospective of his violent youth and dysfunctional education, the viewer never thinks that Panzram is more a victim than an offender. Of course, the system is corrupt, with one gangster occupying the entire Leavenworth prison hospital (where most of the film is taking place), most prison guards are sadistic bullies, and the prison director is something like a megalomaniac despot. But why justify the panzram on the new guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) on Earth? Even after reading his terrible diaries? The film offers several explanations: The small witnesses Panzrama, who is the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guarded person in the pulp, is impressed by Panzram's intelligence (though it is not clear why the little man thinks this person is so clever). Surely it is not enough to sympathize with an enemy like Panzram, even though this film tends to worsen its crimes and highlight its personality? Panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is impressed that Mal√©ra prevails over all the atrocities he has read in Panzram's diaries. Does that little Little has so few friends that he takes on a person who seems to be remotely friendly? Maybe it's a small one that is the product of a modern society that focuses on appearance and not substance. I can advise Monster, who plays Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a film that far matches the same topics of more integrity and scope. <br /> <br /> BTW: Killer looks like he was shot for television (not so good)
