A horrible movie. If there is one Turkish film, you should avoid seeing in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Other than a pair of cheap laughs this film does not achieve anything, bore, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap and sexual clich√©s follow it. The director has to watch more movies before attempting to direct his own. Women with a red head show examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how to do it, it is a perfect example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the film is to wait, wait, there's nothing good about what I can say about it. I really did not want to write about it so much. Jeez!
