It's not a good movie. Too preached in parts and the story was under par. The 3D was fine, but not fabulous. I almost fell asleep in this movie. The story is about 3 young flies who want to have an adventure and follow on. The figures are missing, they really do not like these characters and I feel they have nothing to interest adults. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more special 3D effects. I also liked to see more jokes than my mum constantly said "The Lord of the Flies" Pretty sexist in showing women as wives and fairies.
