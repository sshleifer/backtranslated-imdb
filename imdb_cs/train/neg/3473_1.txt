This is perhaps the worst Christmas movie ever. Give it is virtually non-existent, acting (especially Affleck) is at best bad. Ben Affleck fans are likely to defend this film, but they have to agree deeply. Until I could collect the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire marketer, he is told to shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn the list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. This way, it will end up paying a family who currently lives in the house to be his family at Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually gets along with the daughter of the family ... blah blah blah.
