What did they think of "Cannes"? One of the most irritating films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how insignificant it was shown. If I had to watch her dressing up the shoes again, I think I'd scream. If the aim of this film was to show how wonderful Rosetta had, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits would run. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes again and again. The whole thing was filled with impolite and indecent characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think about going through "Tumbleweeds" to see this exaggerated movie bored. It was like watching the grass, but it is very exciting.
