"I do not get it. Nothing makes any sense!", Cried one exasperated character at the end of Death Smiles on Murder. After experiencing this thoroughly messy disorder of the movie, I know exactly how she feels. The story of Aristida Massacessi (a good old man named Joe D'amato, who uses his real name for change) is a clumsy combination of supernatural, murderous / mysterious and pretentious artistic waste that is likely to appeal to those who admire garbage from the glittery seventies , like the bizarre efforts of Jess Franco, but which I tried to keep conscious. Opening with a hideous sadness the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had before eventually lost to a perfect doctor), Death Smiles at Murder will soon become very confusing when he is the same woman (played by Ewa Aulin playing in an equally weird "Death Laid and Egg ") is seen alive and kicked, the only one who survived an accident at a coach who comes outside of the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück. After being invited to stay and recover in their home where he is a horrific doctor Sturges (Klaus Kinski in the role that is taking place), a nice girl of love begins with Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück on some short but welcome scenarios of nookie and lesbians lovin '). <br /> <br /> "So good," I thought at this point, "we had bumps, incest, courage, and unspoken nudity - all the ingredients of the big horror Euro-horror, but a humble attempt Massacessi combine giallo-style killing, spooky work, and even features from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Black Cat" to tell a very stupid, totally amazing and utterly boring story of revenge from this tomb. , that this film has a lot of admirers on IMDb, but because of the choice I would rather watch one of the films from the later period of my career: I think the incomprehensible, meandered, surrealist 70th Gothic horror is simply not my thing! (purely for cheese gore and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for IMDb.
