He had previously used Wesley Snipes in several action moves, and I expected even more, even from a 5.8 IMDb score, the film does not want to have fun, and although the story is thin and non-original, acting is unfortunately the thinner one and imitates the "worst scenario" strong "feelings accompanied by some bad acting ... Do not forget your time This movie is not fun if you want to cry that it would be enough even though the tears will cry because of Wesley Snipes's vision in the tragic action movie Wannabe Comedy ... <br /> < br /> I give it 2/10 it was really horrible, if you want to see a decent movie, go see a shooter or rent it, all its good stuff this film is not.
