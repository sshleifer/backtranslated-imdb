This is a television and quite useless sci-fi channel that tells the story of Beowulf, especially after the recent Beowulf and Grendel 2005 film. This film does not really get into Beowulf's story, but it just takes us into a fight against a rabbit beast known as Grendel , as it leaves the kingdom in absolute fear and confusion, while a mighty Viking fighter, Beowulf is called upon to get rid of the monster rage. If this happens successfully, the King will no longer have to sacrifice children to keep him at rest. After several unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but it is an angry and revenge mother who soon finds out that Beowulf leaves her to borrow her mighty acts of bravery and power to defeat her. "Grendel" seems to have been shot on a small budget and CG effects are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely useless.
