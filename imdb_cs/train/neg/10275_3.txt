The premise is amazing and some actresses, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is almost impregnable. The music sounds like it came from some kind of page without royalty and text as if it were written with a rhyming vocabulary open on the lap. Most singing is off. I think they could make a singing acupress and put music in it ... The dialogue is really stupid and sad. The film works best when it actually talks about real estate, but unfortunately it often happens to be stupid fake subparts. After the first twenty minutes, I discovered that my watch was checking me, and after sixty years, I was wondering when it would end.
