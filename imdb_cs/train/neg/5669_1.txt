The director, dressed in chains and leather, warned spectators at SF Frameline on Friday night that we were about to see an "experimental" movie. Experimental? Leave your camcorder in the rear seat of the car, let the tape be repaired and edited in all purposeless socks in sight. A moving pastime road show manqu√©, which starts nowhere and leaves no audience to the audience. The free violence that opens the film led more than one patron of the Castro Theater. I would also stay, but my friend needed a home drive, and he had this thing to see even worse merduze to the end. By the time the lights appeared, the audience was significantly diminished. Warm applause. The proforma questioned the director, who seemed to be satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
