Interestingly, acting; it was not bad, it just is not enough. It was somewhat lame. Special effects or lines were not the only culprit of this failure. They stood alone, they were not bad, but it was a tragic step together. The show seemed prolonged and slow with special effects, apparently designed to speed up the film, but it did not succeed. Much of the guilt for this catastrophe has been devoted to special effects. Do not believe it was pretty cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Though it might have been all he had to choose with a few fans. The experienced actress would bring something that Apple had never done. Scfi makes some really good original movies, it's just bad that it did not happen so drastically.
