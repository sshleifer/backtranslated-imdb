It is Steele's typical Romance production that two people who have tragedy have managed to meet despite a chance. I would not say a spoiler, because someone who read the Steele novel knows how it all ends. If you do not want to know much about the plot, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a decent French woman who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making movies where she needs to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, can not realistically repel any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who recovers from a somewhat unpleasant divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. The two meet on the beach over their daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a childish cripple just because he talked about art with a child. Everyone after this episode becomes friends and then falls in love with a couple. Chemistry between the two leaders is not great, although the talent of these two people, in my opinion, is not a question. They did the best they could, with a predictable conspiracy and a script that bordered on stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedies, mystery is revealed, another tragedy and then gather. I wish it was more than that, but there it is in a nutshell. I wanted to have homeless fun and I got it. As for the genre of romantic films, this is not memorable. The "secret affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not the Steele book), just like some of Steele's older books have changed to film.
