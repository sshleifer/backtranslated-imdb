I have no comment on this movie It's so bad I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to save some time for some audiences and did something more interesting instead of watching this movie ... it does something even though I'm watching on the walls is better. And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I will also tell you a low budget, bad acting, no actors names, stupid mutt like a wolf and so on ... Also the story brings nothing new, special effects are done in style 80. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (not watching this movie)
