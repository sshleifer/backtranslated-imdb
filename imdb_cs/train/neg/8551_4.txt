It is 1982, two years after the Iranian embassy that included the dramatic rescue of the SAS from the balconies and the war with Argentina over Falkland, what a better film than the Gung-Ho "SAS" -creating the siege of the Iranian hostages, while Britains is the number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. cast Edward Woodward and several other famous actors and you win the hand ... Maybe not! The film itself does not make a serious situation, while the acting is fairly low. it's like a long episode of "The Professionals," but without a formula. This movie goes nowhere and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli was watching this movie and decided to drop Lewis Collins as Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. See if your fan Lewis Collins or SAS things in general, if not, save time.
