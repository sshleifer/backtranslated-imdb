How did this happen? Generally I love science fiction / bigfoot, whether movies, etc. but I still expect them to be written without it being so many cheeses. The effects were sad, the lines were more sad. Avoid at all costs. Finally, I finally bought it because it was a bad case (I was looking for Sasquatch and Lance Henrikson - I have not seen it yet). The idea of ​​the film is actually good. There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie. I just do not see how this ends up. Go talk to film / artistic / English interested students at every high school and find people who can write a better script.
