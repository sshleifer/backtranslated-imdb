99.999% pure bull. And the other 0,001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde cat was going to ruin. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary wrong. The action was sucking and there was no sex (the aforementioned blonde is modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I ever saw on the film, and the anachronisms were numerous and sharp. The effects were average even from Benny Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" in this movie. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad. I've seen college games being made more. This is the type of movie on which MST3K benefits. The heads should fit science fiction because they allowed the smoke to be airborne.
