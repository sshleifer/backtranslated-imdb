Yikes made this film blow. The figures were weak, the fence was weaker. I thought it could not be too bad because Christoper Walken, oops. He had to do this because he was bored and needed money. The figures were to be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something nice about this, I can not say that Walken did a great job of woody character. Find something you want to read or watch, you will never see this movie.
