If you are not a student who should see everything, this film will not only be a waste of time and money, but also a great disappointment, but also an angry conviction. <br /> <br /> It is a story worth telling somewhere inside, but Hopkins has decided to hide and encode so many chaotic layers of seemingly random audio video recorders, which in a short while causes the audience's patience to be weak. someone like Hopkins would pick such a heavy, heaviest and highly unstable project as his first screenplay, the first score and the third film can all guess. Maybe he'd been playing in his mind for so long until he was underestimated, like what had happened, and not for himself. The result proves that he has not enough experience or skills to achieve the desired result. Even the strangest films of Carpenter and Lynch, they named only two unattended filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% less characters, and 99% more story. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony focused on the stars, but unfortunately I did not get a couple of light years. Please keep acting, in this department you are an unrivaled industry and no one should ask you more or yourself!
