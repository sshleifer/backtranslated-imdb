In this movie there are laughs, that's for sure. Michael Keaton's talent and he was humorous (he decided he was a serious actor). However, what interests me so much about this film is how practically not all the characters are virtually indestructible. In addition to the two main wires, each is jamming. I think these neglected burghers are about as dirty as you get. Just to look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. In addition, the American factory worker is portrayed as lazy and ungrateful slob. I wanted to wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh, in the end they all gathered together, but I just did not like the way to get there.
