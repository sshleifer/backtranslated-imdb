My wife and I thought that with this actor and director, the film would have to be at least very attentive. We were wrong. In fact, we surrendered after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young, and Tone are British, but talking with American accents, was not enough for me to get into the past - hard to believe that this is England when no one calls the British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and no one, and as an echo previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for themselves for no reason is absurd. There's no reason to take care of some of the characters, so we threw the towel in half. I found it hard to believe that the Hawks had ruled because none of the actors spoke with the trade name Hawksian rat-a-tat. This will save you time and skip this option.
