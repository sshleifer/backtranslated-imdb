I'm not sure if it's language or poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. When he saw Der Untergang, it was a huge disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people could do such a disorder of something that had great potential. And above all everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound and in particular Hitler reminds himself of Hitler when he speaks / screams German. The way the story is told has made me believe it's improvised on the spot, the characters are empty, and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could happen. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
