I remember watching this film in 86, when it first came out and what a horrible movie. It was a horror that the plot was so thin that it would be, or it should explode in the breath of the wind. I think I slept more than once and I was not tired of remembering. Please avoid at all costs better still have all the teeth removed without anesthetics, which would be more fun. It's a shame I could not give zero or a negative score. I wish I did not lose my money when I got this from a videotape, all I can say was that the tape she was in was completely new, hardly surprising because the film was so poor. If I remember well, I sat down and watched it with a girl I really wanted to go out and the fact that she was sitting beside me was not enough to hold me up, which is the bad movie.
