In spite of this, or partly because of the clever use of music to underline the motivations and ideologies of each of the main characters, there are stereotypes in themselves, and verisimilitude and characterization are in this not too subtle film screed. <br /> <br /> One has the sense that John Singleton was dubbing in poststructuralist literary theory because it was the taste of the day and "higher learning" was a tendency to be. The low point of the film is a peaceful rally in which the symbols of the 1960s "free love" are reassigned for what is much more like the Take The Night gathering with live, sharply recognizable musical acts into the tow. Perhaps in his first-class revisionism, the director was trying to assert that identity politics is a new Vietnam? Ooh, as Adrienne Rich of him and Remy's shooting into the crowd becomes a nice touch when you look at Rich's political poses. I wish I could make this film a negative star. I can only recommend it to those interested in the 1990s as a history where radical feminists have brought the academic trio of race, class and gender into popular culture, and have said that one hates "a viable and honest POLITICAL option." Where is Camille Paglia when you need her?
