If I had not read his name on the DVD cover, I would never have doubted that this rather captivating and old-fashioned musical was created by a man who was so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from wondering if in the 1950s and 1960s the new wolves of the autographs would hate this movie-it's so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. What I also found a little surprising was the amount of praise some reviewers have given this film - especially when it's so much better French musicals out there. The song in this movie was simply not particularly interesting and the characters looked so dim and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich man who was worried about how hard he was to be rich or get a good selling price on designer clothes, I had to crumble. As a result, as American musicals, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes") and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I see no reason to recommend it as anything but boring weird.
