We do not find any new excitement on the plot, even the same cube I begins. This time there are no further improvements for dice machines, except that they have a special output that is not guarded, very brilliant. The characters are not as well worked as in the first episode, but they just became "flat" as in the series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> There is really nothing to say about it.
