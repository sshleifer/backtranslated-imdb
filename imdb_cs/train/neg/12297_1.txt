Witchy Hildegard Knef captures a group of people in an isolated hotel and selects them one by one in a twisted, disgusting way. I thought I saw it all until the unfortunate man was crucified here, and then he would have lit his head. Hildy is such a joke: she took a nasty harp and closed her mouth ... and then she hangs her up in the chimney, just in time, on the glowing fire! "Dizziness" caused me illness. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever - sometimes ever made by other competent people ... until the final. I have to admit I loved the end. This is a boy and his toy with a tape recorder that Linda Blair looks fantastically obsessed. The scene takes about a minute and the movie ends, but you know the old saying, "If you have a great end, people will only forgive you!"
