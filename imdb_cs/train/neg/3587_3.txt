How they can from Joe Don Baker (like Buffard Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Buffard Pusser in the second sequel). Why do they do it for? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Buffard Pusser, they should not have changed it because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one of the things I wanted to see in the second sequel. I would give this movie 7 out 10 and I'd give it 1 out of 10 if the story did'nt have to do with Bufford Pusser's life but it did and why I gave this movie 3 out of 10. <br / > <br /> I strongly suggest that someone who plans to watch this cheese, I suggest, and does not intend to look at the first sequel.
