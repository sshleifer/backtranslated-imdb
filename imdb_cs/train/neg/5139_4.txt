It seems that a lot of horror fans love scarecrows, so they will not be very popular when I say it's a little boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to attract so much. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror films in the dark can work (like Humongous), but the scarecrows are in the dark for the whole movie. It's a lot of time to find out what's really going on, and though some shots were scary, most of them were hard to see. If a little more lighting was used, it might be better. There are not many films that contain murderous scarecrows, except the Dark Night of Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over the Strašáci for a day.
