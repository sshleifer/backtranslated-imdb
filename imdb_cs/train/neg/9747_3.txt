Okay, first, this movie is upset. But let's why why. Claiming that the machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it and then transmitting it and thinking it again is at least interesting. But it is as far as this assumption is. Instead of plunging into what could happen if someone built such a machine, it would break the damn thing. This could be a good prerequisite. To live with the responsibility of this kind of power and to deal with constant temptation, ie, the Invisible Man. But no .. it breaks the thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So the doctor is jogging back and trying to get himself. Just to let him conjure up his beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh). Which would not happen if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he rotates in the country and kills people because his little experiment failed and they did not give him the money. Wah. Then, to make the film worse, cast the dry British relationship between the two half-competent professors who hired him to help him. Among their loving sessions, they make a few unspeakable attempts to find him while killing half of London. All this could have been avoided by not breaking a damned machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried to give him two honest stars for the effort, but it would be better if they did not break the damn machine, so Lembach left to try it again. Damn Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
