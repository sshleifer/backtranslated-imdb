Who am I? I am not joking. That's what he really says on the video. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: Pretty woman standing with a smile. That for some reason causes all people to kill each other. "Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... He can not find Ariel ..." He's right behind you, you idiot. <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this terrible small space opera has already been said to look. <br /> <br /> A lot of horrific actors playing most of the convicts came after the first selection of actors is very quickly eliminated. Then they are discarded in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a drawing of straw to find out which actors had the most time on the screen and more pay control. Alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically helpless and does nothing. Why can not she stay on the computer instead of doing the "teleporter vampire" routine? (In fact, it would be more interesting if she was a vampire, or she would do more than just walk around when she was looking at people, which is all she ever did, that's enough to kill each other. . <br /> <br /> This is not actually a 3D movie. There are many more footage of the old western footpath, the Easy Rider from 1950, the Film noir nightclub scene, even a jog on the beach in a fantasy land, none of which has any real depth or not even meaning. The nightclub scene is of course black and white. He worked with "The Wizard of Oz". It does not work so well. That's probably a good thing, because the few shots they prove are depressing stupidity. You'll probably cry during those moments, especially when you see the swirling "space ship" that looks about three centimeters long. Nothing for him feels anything, not because they are condemned or lacking personalities, but because they have a serious need to do lessons, except for Billy Dee Williams, who really looks depressed and lost, probably by working in this ... < br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, when seen with friends, will cause some extremely "loud" silence, especially when a nerdy throws out his attempt at comic unicorns (including a line on French - kissing meteors ...) I may not perhaps ...) Original virtual reality gets into "killing", which means nothing because they are not real yet. Well, the other "characters" are not, but that's next. Ha-Ha. What's a bit funny is that the scene that loves the video case is some sort of skull-horror-alien looking thing (green filter added to the top of it to make it more a ... uh ... green look), which is actually an android when it's killed and finally has nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another special event I noticed. Whenever there's a blast (at least on my cheap DVD copying), everything becomes highly pixelated. I do not think LITTLE pixelated, I mean huge blocks about 1/16th screen size. Wow.
