I read the book Celestine Prophecy and I was looking forward to the film being filmed. Please note that the movie is freely based on a book. Many of the most interesting points in the book will not even appear in the movie. It's the movie "B" at best. Many events, characters, as the book meets and meet in a book, simply changes or does not happen. The flow of events that are very smooth in the book is torn and brought to the view as if you were a child. Character development is very bad. Personnallities characters are different from those in the book. The direction is similar to the "B" horror. I understand it will take six hours in the movie to introduce everything in the book, but on the screen the game base misses many points. Casting was very good.
