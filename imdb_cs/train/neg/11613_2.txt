A terrible film with Frank Sinatra like Tony Rome. Here he joins a dead woman under the sea. Rome soon recruited to find out what had happened to a woman. Of course she's a woman under the sea. Her boyfriend, Lainie Kazan, will soon get to the ground. The aging Richard Conte plays police officer and friend of Rome. When the local owner of the club is killed, he blames Rome and becomes an interesting pursued scene. So it's a bad picture if you have to depend on the chase scene you want to deliver. Raquel Welch plays beauty to his neck in intrigue. Her acting leads a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> By the end of the movie you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother to ask.
