I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documents I've ever seen. You see people are clueless to him. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they come from Puerto Rican offspring, but they probably know less than others who are not here. During speaking, you can see that they are contradictory. If you would like to see the real and I think genuine original document from Puerto Rico then you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real document. Not like this piece of junk mail. Rosie Perez created this document on herself. I thought it was about Puerto Ricans. They keep saying that I did not know. Well, that's the only thing they did on the so-called documentary film. I hate to see a piece of rubbish that happens with the name of the island. It reduces standards.
