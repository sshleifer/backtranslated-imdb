I loved the original. It was great and it will always be. I was especially pleased to look at re-make. I'm usually a bit against re-doing because there are too many of them, but it kind of catches me. I really enjoyed it. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law, who was able to hold, is next to him. It was quite clever as it was upgraded and it worked. What stops it from being really good is the last seven minutes. It's completely away from the original, so far it's actually becoming clever and just poisoning. The end in the original was fantastic! So much tension was built and it was incredibly clever! This? He does not grow up in tense, but in frustration, as he seems to have decided to make Caine's character homosexual. It was if they tried hard to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Credit roles. This film is just watching for the show, but it's really dragging the last seven minutes. What a shame....
