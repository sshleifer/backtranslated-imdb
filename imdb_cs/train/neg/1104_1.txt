This is one of the worst written films I've ever had to sit with. The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon so who cares if it's nice and fun? <br /> <br /> I will not go as deep as the characteristics or I will be here all day (except that there are none, the characters change the personality whenever it is suitable for the fence) but the one who wrote the script and the visual direction , should have banned access as well as pencil and paper. Thumb down?
