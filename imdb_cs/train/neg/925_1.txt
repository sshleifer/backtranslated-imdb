ok, this movie f * ck in 'rules. is undoubtedly one of the most technically unrealistic cinemas. Totally horrible, but GOTTA you see. rent it with your friends and come with a drinking game or just have fun, it's funny. and the backstage scenario proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and fingers. amazing. ok, just borrow it for this one scene: the two characters are actually RUNNING ON THE PLACE about 3 minutes in the shot. the director (in the commentary) says "Yeah, watching was so smooth, it looked like they are ...". yeah, the right guy, they're all right. it's so funny.
