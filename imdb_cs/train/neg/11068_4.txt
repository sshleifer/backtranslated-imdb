Dahmer, a young, confused man. Dahmer, a confused film. I think I had a couple of beers watching the movie, but it does not explain why I was bored like that. <br /> <br /> Its obstacles are nothing more than confused and annoying, and there is no real story behind and the end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and at the very end of the movie. Inbetween things that would be movies are just boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, it's all a lot of inscriptions. Sometimes you even feel that Dahmer is dreaming of the whole thing, but you know it is not because it's based on a true story, and that's what happened, at least most of the time. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. I did not like it, and I felt cheated when it was over. <br /> <br /> * / *****
