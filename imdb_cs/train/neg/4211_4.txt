About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I've been looking at it again and again and again. But now ... I do not. I think this movie would be great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. She has a lot of heavy actors commentators (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty cheese plot. My favorite part is when Culkin rides a bike and comes across a gang and the gang member says, "Hey, Tyler, where are you going?" Also look at the classic line: "Do you feel in your fingers?" On the other hand, it's better than "The Good Son".
