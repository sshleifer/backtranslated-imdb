I like filming, but the story is growing a bit slow. Danny Glover does a good job, so you're wondering if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid had no space in the story he could have. I thought the first scene was a little worse than the story unfolded. I looked at it again. I rated her 5 (I would like to rate him 5.5)
