One of my best friends brought this film overnight with the words "Do I want to watch the worst horror film ever?" I always enjoyed a good laugh in a terrible horror and said yes. I expected your typical b-slasher, but it was behind B. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest of the low. With a clearly low budget, extremely bad actor, bad lightning, no conspiracy, really bad "Special Effects", awesome cameras, and terrible soundtrack, it looks like films like House of Wax look like masterpieces that earned the Oscar. The only good thing is about 15 seconds when one of the figures got topless - she had very nice breasts. Most of what I said during this film was in the same spirit: "It's really so crazy," "It's the worst movie ever," and "I'm not drunk for me." So at the end: do not waste time (or money!).
