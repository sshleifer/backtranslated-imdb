We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have a "rebellious teenage daughter", an adopted white baby and a cute baby. And we have a careless home, what kind of show does this house have? Do we have a dirty Brady Bunch? Yeah! When it first came out, I thought it was really great, mostly because I was young. Music was bad. The ramps were so bad and they had too many ratings. All his executions concerned his family and friends and problems. Dad was kind of a daddy "Danny from Full House". I've always advised. But it was not a strange thing. They had a house for it. Remember? The land was basically Lil 'Romeo had a problem, or ... not so. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, It's good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
