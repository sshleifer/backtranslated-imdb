Michael Callan plays a magical photographer who seems to be considered a perfect "catch" by any woman who is spinning him; could it have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? It's a "hero" with which it's very difficult to concentrate, so the film has problems right from the start. However, this is not a problem. It has the production value of a television movie (make sure that the head is made of clay or something similar, near the end) and final scams in such a way that I can not reveal if anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). Let's just say the killer knows more than we let him know he knows. (* 1/2)
