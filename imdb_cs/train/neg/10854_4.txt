Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a movie where we are intrigued by intricate delicate little narrative nuances. It's not a movie where special effects should leave a quiet sound that tells you about the knocking sensation. What it is, but it's a slice of lo-fi goth of horror that leaves little to the imagination, created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon, as "a return to the dirty 70s and 80s of horror." It is a very visceral experience for 2 hours, when four lines of conspiracy are linked with plenty of watery blood, fractures of the body and the guts that are connected with the intestinal nod of vengeance. <br /> <br /> The supplier of such terrible violence is Dani Filth, a singer from the metal band Cradle of Filth who performed the role he was meant to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new about wanting to have a separate revenge. In this particular context, the condemned sexual predator and murderer, Kemper, the father of our devilish revenge angel, forces his son to exactly compensate those who are some as linked to condemning him to purge inside a crazy asylum. <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> He seems to have been rejoicing in the idea that the blood is flowing into the openings of those on the screen and into every corner and shelter that you get. We are also familiar with broken skulls, demonic rapes, and other varied shots to engage those who want to get to their horror. And for some of those who are watching these types of movies carefully, there's a special sequence that might think, "I just saw what I thought I was," because of course she's a pretty woman. It reminds me of some gore festivals created from Italian horror about 20-30 years ago, and many other works where disgusting paintings left their mark, but not the context in which they were seen. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> The story of the 4 file is particularly interesting where the thought of those obsessions can eventually lead to killing in the pursuit of internet violence through a "sick room" where the user controls how life can be thrown out. Another recognition should come out on a crazy soundtrack that allows Filth to perform his talents throughout the day and the effective use of drums and basses, often overlooked in the film, as viable forms of visual support. Using the city of London as a background with real people unlike the movie stand-in also adds support to the movie's sense commando. OK, the classic does not have to be, but the blood, the intestines, the intestines, the occult, and the demons in a slightly perverse, seamless way.
