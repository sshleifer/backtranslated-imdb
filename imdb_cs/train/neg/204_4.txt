Perfect murder is ruined when a woman (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once wife of director Robert Zemeckis who was driving this episode) who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of accepting a visitor when he is going outdoors ... escaping a mad madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit (played by the ominously hideous Larry Drake). She takes care of her life as she tries to find a way to hide her man's corpse. He decides to use an ax as soon as Santa's killer drops down, losing a few chances to cut off his wife's head, and puts the murderer behind her husband's murder. Santa murderer locks her in the cloakroom and watches a woman's daughter when she tries desperately to free herself to save her baby. This episode OF CRAFTS OFFERS only recycles tired material including the old "Santa Kills" theme and at the same time adds the often used (add nauseum) woman-murder-her-husband-for-man-she-was-cheating-with a routine. Essentially, Trainor is trying to find a way to avoid him being trapped with the dead body he is killing while keeping a safe distance from the maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new about this conspiracy that moves through the movements. Not one of the highlights of the show.
