Art house maven dream. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; a demanding melange that not only did not deserve the best picture of its own merits in 1951, has suffered competition from the beginning. Spotlight in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott, and Costello Meet an invisible man; you name it if it came out in 51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The final ballet is for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in bad film. Several actors in their time were less capable (playing) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My worst of '51 (I saw 201 films) and among the 5 worst Oscar winners for the best picture.
