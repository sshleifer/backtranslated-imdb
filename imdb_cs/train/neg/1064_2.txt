be warned: this film tells a lot of love stories without coherence. <br /> <br /> The only purpose of this movie seems to show love in many different ways. Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a skeptical plot idea. The writer tried to build turnovers that were meant to surprise the viewer. However, it simply did not work because you did not know characters in the past or these "jokes" were just stupid. It's a movie about love that can not reach your heart. Ten times. Or more, I do not know and I do not care.
