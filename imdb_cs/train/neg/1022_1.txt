Beginning with poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a scam. One stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or at least nothing new. After 10 to 15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J lecture the way for another cop-flick. In essence, there is a story about a corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by spine business and in the city, under the watchful eye of some shot-out politician. Almighty and multinational organizations are called FRAT and guess what? they have kick-ass furious police firing and beating the will - suspect, girlfriend, you name it. FRAT officers are corrupt and greedy, so they make mistakes that a young talented (!!!) journalist discovers. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad scenarios and more stereotypical lines, everything ends happily and we get the final line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not forget about this film waste. Freeman and Spacey have barely 10 minutes!
