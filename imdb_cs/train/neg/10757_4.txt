I just saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to look for reviews this morning. It seems that "I, the Robot" polarized the critical observation community here on IMDb (and aroused many insults and appointments). the movie is not great (or even good), but it's not even terrible (or even really bad). What this movie really is is ... depressing. It suppresses that the American filmmakers' population is so ready to get into the mess, clich√©s reheat and recognize them as magnificent new works. This movie, as a protectorate, written around the world, from the conspiracy line (the uncompromising mix of Asimov and the modern uber-action) to the character of Smith (intelligent cynic with the backbone of titanium), to the special effects that they borrowed from Matrix and the other couple. <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is a sadly rather perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, cluttered clever dialogue and lots of adrenaline. Smith is average, but we already knew it (it seems that it is the last failed attempt of Hollywood to create black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes, of all sizes, but I do not think most of the people who are filming this movie are critical enough to notice it. Perhaps it would be a market block according to today's standards, but a very B-film compared to true winners.
