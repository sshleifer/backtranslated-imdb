Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day Meets a Horror Film of a Christian Coalition. Maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite threatening and brutal). I say maybe because it wakes up and it was all a dream ... or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen-minute plots (completed quite well for the first time) are repeated over and over again. And because Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I stop worrying about what happened to Claire and started thinking about what a crooked procedure at the end will pull it together. (which would most sincerely make sense), but instead one of those that is too obvious for half of the surprising endings (Think of a village or down). The movie mirrors faster than the directors Donnie Darko. All the great curved endings in horror films The Sixth Sense, Original Invasion of Body Hijackers, Happy birthday to me worked because the audience did not expect an explanation to the left. (Heck even the canoe ending on the original Friday thirteenth was worth the effort) <br /> <br /> Rescuing the other side of the bend ending with each change of scene. Other flaws in weight loss are one piano soundtrack (although the selected songs were decent), the obvious time filling (Claire makes dishes, Claire's mother is subplots), as Claire says "hello is someone there" every time she thinks there is a series Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, who resembles a zombie Mary Kay) shows for the first time that actors have low budget roots. <br /> <br /> Both are too smart in half and are not nearly as smart as Salvage keeps you interested just to see how he's going to fix this mess. The problem is that it really is not.
