I was thrilled to see a sitcom that might be an Indian candy, but I found this show not fun at all. Producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feeding back because if it comes to talking about it! I was ready for some stereotypes and I had no problem with it, because stereotypes exist for some reason, they are usually true. But there was nothing sad about these stereotypical figures. Father "fresh out of the boat" who does not understand his daughter. Radical feminist Muslim daughter (who, by the way, is a terrible actress) and a young, modern Indian man who tries to manage his mosque politically correct as much as possible (he's a pretty good actor, I just see he's getting better). /> <br /> It is very subdued and the dialogue does not flow so well. there was so much potential for something like that, but sadly I think it failed and I really can not watch another episode. I loved watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, it's always a treat and naturally everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show does not have the same acting skills!
