I do not know about you, but I always felt attracted to the "ART" cinema. The first "artistic" movie I was able to get was Peter Greenaway's "Chef, a thief, his wife and her lover," which detonated my mind and the creative spiret into skipping. The film was the ultimate paradox, beautiful and grotesque ... it was what was an "art cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and bringing visceral to the screen with the goal. Life, real life, can be like living in a fool, and artistic expression shows why it is. I like movies of all kinds, but especially those that both have fun and have something to say, whether I agree with my attitude or not ... 8 1/2 WOMEN is a dry, cinematic comedy "where the father and son collect a hare to prove their many sexual fantasies. The film is a very short hint of the film Fellini, unlike what the thumbnails suggest. The main focus of the film lies in the "close" relationship between the father and the son who was associated after the death of his mother. In the early scenes of the movie, sadness of fathers is believable, you can feel his pain. What then happens is the Greenaway standard, the harem assembly, the observation of love and death, and the body exposed to the body ... It could be said, but I think the film is shallow and useless. And the idea that it could be a comedy is disturbing to me. Most is when it's ok, especially good Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though bad Mandy should return her clothes back). What's missing the movie is the compelling story and the usual Greenaway touches of surplus, other movies that are so wonderful. <br /> <br /> While filled moments of insight and occasional taboos, "8 1/2 women" are too cut and paste to be considered art, too insignificant to be considered "fun" and simply too boring < <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
