There seems to be some curses in the gay cinema. Specifically, happy ends are not very common. A beautiful thing is ruled out, gay movies tend to end up in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, are just coming to an end. The creators of this terrible piece of nonsense have something or two to learn about conspiracy, direction and deadlines. During the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a little confused and even more after the first look at the character of Jeremie Elkaim, who has little psychology. It appears that this film was accidentally linked without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to find out when you look at the current or some kind of ethereal flash. I can only do this until it becomes really hateful. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this movie "... glitteringly beautiful and totally real." Well, Stephen seems to have invested in beer glasses before viewing because it's really far from beautiful. Since the movie got the flavor, I was expecting something that would interest me. Sadly, the film lived up to his title. And by the end of the film (which would not allow any solution, I could add) it is clear that writers, director and film have all come back.
