As a military history of World War II and someone who is not proud of the country's history of racial relations, I look forward to this film. What a disappointing piece of schlod. I did about three-quarters of it, but I should have turned it off on a subactive scene. The idea that a U-boat would fire a torpedo at DDE, as if there was a chance of hitting her and then "escaping" from DDE submerged, is absurd. And that's just a little detail. The whole movie was badly written, misdirected, and misbehaving. I agree with others on this album that it could be a good movie. It's like they've decided that since all the well-thought-out WWW promotional films were made with all-white castings, they needed black people. And as bad as old movies, it's even worse. And there's almost a fake Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea flick. It turned out to have very small roles. I have to believe that these two gentle actors were embarrassed with this film. I'm done. I've gotten too much of my life in this fucking movie.
