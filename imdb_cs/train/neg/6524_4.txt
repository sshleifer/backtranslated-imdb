Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Just like "The Man From Planet X," this bizarre science fiction story is reversed from a period of fantasy and science fiction that was still damn close to the same thing. It means we have some highly blending special effects and uncontrollable pseudo-science camouflage like science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" released in high quality transmission with sharp images and crisp sound - Midnite films. So the main reason why you are watching this movie? Oh, it's definitely our Mars space crew all the time. (What do you think the "Angry Red Planet" refers to Neptune?) Previously, there is a poor quality space crew aboard the spaceship, inside which smokes and throws around the crew-focused sexist chevrons. insulting, if it were not so damn fun, but Mars is the real reason why we're watching this thing, the film is generally black and white, but Mars, well, Mars is bloody red, the film is filmed in this bizarre red plastic gloss that gives angry The red planet is quite interesting to look overly nasty It's really quite a sight as well as (ha ha) aliens viewers are witnessing The best is "ratbatspidercrab" Do you think it's a joke? That's what they say in the movie! this gigantic chimera (a small puppet) that combines the features of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It is played along the whole puppet and scares us "heroic crews." There are other weird and ill-pretended aliens who are seen, but he takes a cake. Eventually, after the sexual experience on Mars, the sexist crew will fit into the "ship" and return to any planet they came from. It's not for everyone. Film fans of science fiction and curiosity seekers and some movie lovers. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field this day (if they never get to the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Moderate score, 6/10 score Nostalgie, 4/10 overall. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
