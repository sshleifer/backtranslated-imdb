I wrote at least half a dozen shy reviews of this horror movie and no one is going to be released, so I have to think that someone on imdb.com really loves this terrible movie. The idea that a lot of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has been in the desert for more than a decade and is back from it is ridiculous. There is also acting and direction. Go to it.
