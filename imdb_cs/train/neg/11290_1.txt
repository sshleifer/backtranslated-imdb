The worst film of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie was originally called "The Treasure," but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement of the "jaw". I think sharks are in one scene of this movie; the fact that they were part of this "thriller" had to sell tickets. He did not work. Whenever something "good" appears in the movie, the crew of the boat drank a bit of a beer brand that was just introduced at the time the film was shot. Gee, do you think beer could be a sponsor? Could they be even clearer? The only time someone should let go of beer is if he can do that. That's the reason for the celebration.
