My husband and I went to see this movie, being fans of horror movies that we are. Two hours later I found out that I want both money and time back. I was so disappointed. The film's samples contained essentially the best points of the film. There was nothing scary on the film, like a good time on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the "spooky" parts to be comical than anything else. Looking at other films based on Japanese writers' work, I have to conclude that what is terrifying in Japan is not what is scary here in the United States. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain to sit in this. I can not really say I would recommend you rent it if you do not have a free rental available.
