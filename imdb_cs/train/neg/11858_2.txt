I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I found on the cable - is totally helpless. I see that the screenwriter and the director are one and the same, so no one has ever seen to check her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, no original characters. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic. What is the loss of this acting talent. Considering how expensive it is to shoot these days in New York, I must wonder how it happened first and foremost. And if you wonder why I ever watched it, it came after a movie I liked and I left it on when I was working at my computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
