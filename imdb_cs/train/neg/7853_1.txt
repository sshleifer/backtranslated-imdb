No plot, poor acting, and unnecessary gore .... Should this be a horror movie? There is no fear or tension, just BOOM BANG GORE, then it's over. Some sailors are in the desert for some strange, filthy reason and are chased by those mutated animals from the first movie that was good and should be left. just another excuse for money and the use of absurd violence, as well as the sequel to "Saw". They know that no matter how insignificant the plot is, the more people can see it. I miss good filthy movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do a lot, much better.
