Synopsis: When his wife, the reporter is kidnapped and replaced by a pair of androids, secret service agent Eric Phillips follows her and reveals the plan of the arms dealer to create an army of unbeatable androids to assassinate world leaders. /> <br /> I did not expect much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker" tool. The film was nothing special, not to mention the sharp tearing of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with the entire action sequence that opens the movie. There are plenty of blasts, heavy shooting and huge bodycounts, as well as some martial arts moving with the favors of movie star Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The entire movie looks like a series of action scenes that are associated with a minimal conspiracy. On the front line, Wilson is a bad actor. She really needs personality transplantation.
