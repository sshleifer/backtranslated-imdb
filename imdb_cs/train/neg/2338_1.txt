How could it be that no journalist or critic reminded us of the similarity with the further better Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in the Congo Express put together without really having a relationship: Jean, (de Congolees), a laborer, two taxi drivers, street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. This should not be a reason to forgive mistakes in the script (if there is a script) Anyway, the Wind Wind. Joke (only!) The ice-cream party is taken from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte gives too much salt to the potatoes. Some accidents appear in the movie, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman brings us a movie that is more like an attempt to watch television than a movie for theaters. Another missed chance for the Flemish cinema.
