Ah, yes, 1980s, Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck, and a number of other action stars hiding in the far jungle and blowing chimneys. At that time I could not believe that movies such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (And who can forget the absurd RED DAWN?) They made money in the box office, they are the turgid actions of the bitch fests somewhat out of the box and they are very bad. TROMA'S WAR is a tongue in the face of these types of movies, but you have to ask yourself that they need spoofing first? Of course not . TROMA'S WAR has no sophistication - although it shows that there is no difference between right-wing tyrants and left-wing wings - and sometimes it feels like a movie from a degree rather than a poster. Maybe it is?
