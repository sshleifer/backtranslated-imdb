I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 is a pretty good horror film When the body of a terrorist, infected by a stolen chemical, is restored by the US Army, the corpse is then burned and releases the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. The soon-to-be infected locals turn into a mass zombie, and a group of holiday soldiers have to join a group of tourists and board an abandoned hotel as they try to fight aggressive living dead. I did not find the film that would be as good as the original film Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still a good horror film with good action. I did not think he was one of the best in the series. 4/10
