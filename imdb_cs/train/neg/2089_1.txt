Of course, I watched BG. I loved S1, I liked Season 2, Season 3 was fine and she loved the last one. Yeah, there's a spin-off show! I did not know about it at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was really excited. I was looking at the first three episodes ... What a piece of waste! Teenage girl drama fest. There is no science fiction ... well, little. At the end of each episode, we can look at Cylon. That is all. Who cares? Have they decided that the future target audience will be women under the age of 18? Boring religious nonsense talks, moans, scares ... and more. <br /> <br /> It is only sad that there is nothing at this moment to look at. Stargate destroyed, BG over ...
