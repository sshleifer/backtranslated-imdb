Saint Sh * t was a terrible god. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought I'd get my eyes on Reed's oedipus. dear God. this film deserves more credits than anything that makes a high school movie fan. save money, this movie can not offer you anything. if you do not like side-views and sleep in cinemas. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and interesting things. you will be the only one there. F @ ck this presentation. <br /> <br /> Please note. <br /> <br /> I recommend it not to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How are you? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty good. <br /> <br /> This day I enjoyed this comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch the daily film. this is sad.
