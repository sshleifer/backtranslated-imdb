I could not wait for the movie to go to my DVD player when I rented it. After I started, I could not wait to get out of my DVD player. Actually, I watched the whole movie. My wife and I were waiting and waiting for something sad, but nothing witty at all. Box read as if it was really funny. The premise of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie be missing? Well ... it's missing! This is the most dangerous "comedy" I've ever watched. Nobody I talked to thought was a bit funny. It's just a really dark film. Believe me. Avoid ...
