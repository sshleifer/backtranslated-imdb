Who likes a terrible "comedy" like the Little Mosque in the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who follows it are: one, Muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so excited that there is a show about Muslims that it does not matter if the show is good or funny at all (which is not). Two old people and people whose ideas of comedy are incredibly predictable, misspelled, still jokes. CBC must really look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they just write a comedy for really old people, then guess what's going to happen, their audience will die soon and they will not have any audience. I would be curious who is even writing for this show? Do you think they are really Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I bet they are old white guys who wrote the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. When you look at the CBC comic shows there are, Air Farce was but finally we just took it out of the air (thank god!) But we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer for which we pay, not to mention this bad justification for "comedy" Small mosque on prairie. Should it be death and sorrow? Only CBC would think this lame show is unfortunate or funny. It is a pity on the CBC to forgive our tax dollars at exhibitions, but few people would be bothered to watch.
