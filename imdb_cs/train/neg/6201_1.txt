I have seen it. It's not "good" but interesting. The boys are totally naturalistic, but ................ The graphical / free final scenario scenario is abhorrent and - yes - the arbitrary insertion of World War II footage is offensive in trying to compare the real horror with this misogynistic challenge. Real atrocities are real - this movie is just cruel. The film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that it's "Emperor's new outfit", but it's actually the reverse. The movie looks good, but the direction, story, content, and ultimate feelings you're taking away from this movie are empty. If the feeling can be empty - that's it.
