It was a silly movie with a predictable story and a scary play !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his canvas. The film looked like a very long advertising on the bright red lipstick Jessica Simpson had - especially because there were so many details on her face. The assumptions were not fun and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent on making this film, it was a shameful waste. Any clues to other old movies, Marilyn Monroe, have not improved Blonde Ambition's perception. It was also unbelievable - Jessica Simpson could enter the executive secretary position on a drop of hat - that was ridiculous!
