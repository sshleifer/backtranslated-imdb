I'm not sure if it's a spoiler; it's public service. If you are one of those instantly satisfied people who skip the credits, you will lose the final line of votes for the end-of-vote votes reporting that the US has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945, until the end of the Second World War. Here are just some of the problems with this closeness: 1) The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three UNHOL films in their minds to fill the yawning gap between film events and this surprising conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person actually kicks out that they "do not watch" one of these endless films they created in their own head for a free throw of time and money to see this UNHOL from a video rental shop cable). 3) This end of the order of views may become the first information to which some younger audiences of the Second World War are exposed, which led to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the new heir to the Nazi throne.
