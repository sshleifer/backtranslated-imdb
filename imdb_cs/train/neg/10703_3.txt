but Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have a shine that has a great actor who was awarded 5 years ago. Some humorous lines could have been timed to not just make a comedy. And how does KC come from Katie Koslovska? Plummer's character was so dirty that it would fit better in the Bullwinkle toon. Personally, if the action moves will show the skin - I would like to see the same time between females / males, otherwise do not show any.
