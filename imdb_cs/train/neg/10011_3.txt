This film is about a male escort who has engaged in a murder investigation that has happened in a circle of powerful male women. I thought Walker would be exciting and pilgrimage, but I was so bad. Stimulation is painful and unbearably slow that even after 40 minutes of film nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour could be shortened to ten minutes. So it's slow. The fact that it lacks excitement or action scenes worsens boredom. It is almost shocking that even the scenes arguments are so clear and emotionless. Perhaps it is because of the stiff upper lip of a higher social class? <br /> <br /> It is sad that "The Walker" becomes such a dull disorder, despite so strong a cast. Blame him for a bad plot and even worse pacing.
