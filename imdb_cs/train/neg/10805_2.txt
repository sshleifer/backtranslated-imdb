The only reason I was this DVRd was this film because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I have always heard how terrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's clothes. The worst part was, well, everything else. My 12 year old son and I just jumped up and could not see the screen when Shaq started rapping and we were still wondering why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But for all it is the horror that we just could not stop watching it, the story sucked you like a black hole or sand or tar pit, was hypnotic. But it was laughing and just saying that we actually watched "Kazzam".
