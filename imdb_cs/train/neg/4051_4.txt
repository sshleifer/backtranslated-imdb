Lindsay Anderson was a very European filmmaker, while directors David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker are making spectacular films that include a visionary film. Anderson's film is more of a social commentary and a subtext, so the message often ends in the whole movie, the primary function of which should be to entertain the audience. <br /> <br /> What do you think about what you think about British filmmakers. I am very convinced that the film should be a universal medium (the best British film is someone who, in my opinion, is attempting to emulate Hollywood) if you want to send a message to try a pony express, and find a movie that dates back to the 1960s. 1968 was a summer of love and a year of student rebellion in France. You can only imagine that every French leftist worships this film, especially the culmination. French writers of new waves also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but most international films will not like it and many will not like it
