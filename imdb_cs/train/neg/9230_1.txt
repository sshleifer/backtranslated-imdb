I should qualify this title when I think about it. The checkout is not completely worthless. I have the opportunity to see it twice, and for the second time, I made a great laugh at the film. so I think it's worth something. and it is also worth the terrible pain I caused at my first glance. as another reviewer pointed out, this film is surprised in every sense. no original idea has been put forward in this film (which underlines the note below on the originality of the assumptions). the film is nothing more than a long line of clich√©s that are interconnected and movies around them. it's definitely not other officials, it's definitely not original and it's not absolutely "good, pure fun". The film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite sad, insulting). When I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except the elderly, was totally bored or the pain of this film. during some particularly emotional scenes, as if Nick chewed his mother, the audience actually fell in love because it was so badly done. I've even heard that somebody is groaning in the theater, something I've never witnessed before. I do not care where you can see this movie, whether on a film festival, in an Indian theater or anywhere else. do a favor, skip this movie with revenge. if you are not like me and just can not resist the opportunity to see what can really be the worst movie ever made.
