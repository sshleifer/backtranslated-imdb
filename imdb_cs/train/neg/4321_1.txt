It was the BEST Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took two little children to see it. It was the darkest and hardest fence - the family has no money, the mother loses her job, her father is killed in the bank, the bank robber steals a family car with both children in her back, and after a quick persecution, she leaves the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom remains completely alone. No wonder her Christmas Prophet is gone. Christmas angels do not spare children drowning, and Santa is not returning dead father! I thought it was the worst news I send children. You better tell them there is no Santa to show them a movie like this!
