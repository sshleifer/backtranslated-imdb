Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the top. It has been said, that's what you get when half of the crew has gone to work, unfortunately half of the game. Do not get me wrong, it's fun, but you're tired of hand knobs. Concerning the summary of the plot, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no conspiracy. Grab the guy at the end and win! Eh, who actually plays it?
