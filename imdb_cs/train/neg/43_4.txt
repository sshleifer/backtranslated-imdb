This ugly video was initially banned in the UK and was released last November without cuts. Plays Playboy Playmate in the month of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. It opens between Buchfellner and foggy jungle paintings. I'm not sure what it was. It would be much better to focus on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) can produce time, while another (Werner Pochath) is constantly whining. The purchase of redemption goes to hell and Laura gets into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals will have food? Yes, in this jungle there are cannibals. Why do you think it was a nasty video! Muriel Montossé found Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the hijacker's ship. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, which has already been captured. They run through sex and do not see the dangers coming in. Spell, someone? Big fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> Blood, decapitation, intestines, plenty of full fronts, some big shouting by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the line: "They ripped her heart," which is funny when you see the movie.
