I saw switching targets .. thick ... and always the same feeling ... you see, Olsen twins do the same movie ... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with the boys .. OK now about the movie .... first all such little boys and girls do not play for such big goals ... 2.football does not play on time attacks ... 3.and when the game is over, the referee gives some overtime (minutes and more) ... and the target is so predictable. ... I think this movie is bad due to the lack of knowledge of football ... if it were done by European producers, it would be better .. and sinners are not the choice of Wright ... they suffer from a lack of authenticity .. OK played some vintage in the full house, but it's not big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what's missing in the Olsen Twins
