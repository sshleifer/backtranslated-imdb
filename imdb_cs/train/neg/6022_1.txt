I'm a little tired of people who abuse God's name to preserve their false view of the world. I do not want to reject the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of antichrist, I reject the idea that only some people who really live a good life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to heaven while the rest of us have to suffer millions of hell on earth, that we were not good enough. God may be a judge, but I do not think he will measure every level of good. Give the Creator some credit.
