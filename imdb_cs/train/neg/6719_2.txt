This is a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately it does not look like a great movie. What begins with a sweet and almost gothic romantic comedy about Fluffer in love with his Fluffee tips, out of control, into a bizarre combination of genres and real goulash, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even the curious "dash" 400 BLOWS tossed to the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end this smooth, well-produced film does not fall into anything. Although actors all do work with this material and there are some good laughs behind the scenes of the gay porn world. <br /> <br />
