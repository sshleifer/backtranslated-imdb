My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes, we would call her if it stopped when we were too curious to have the movie redeemed. Not that. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise given to this movie. Writing was totally terrible and delivered by some of the worst gaming I've seen in a very long time. One thing that bothered me most about this movie was often when people were talking to each other was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand that I use a pause to create a feeling of suffering (as in Happiness). It was not a type of pause - it was just a bad drive. This movie could be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the overseas market is best for this movie because then there would be no Indian dialogue and bad dealings. <br /> <br /> These types of small special movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Beautiful and Amazing) but this has failed at so many levels that I consider to be one of the worst movies I have listened to in the last few years .
