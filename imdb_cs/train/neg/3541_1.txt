What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can damage the soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking gangster genre, bites more than he can chew with. His use of modern noir film to address the subject of a man who frees himself to swallow his pride, be dear to his enemy, and give away all his money falls on his face. When the character of Jason Statham no longer likes Ray Liotto, it seems that Liotta is crazy enough to blow her head in the last scene. Why? In essence, you can not build a mafia as Liotto's character, which is likely to get to his station in life by showing what kind of ruthless behavior is evident throughout the movie, and only when he is suicidal by the face of Statham's character. Before anyone says I'm missing that point ... I'm not. Am I okay? Log out of the quest for wealth and find true happiness and inner peace. Be kind toward your enemy and it confuses him into self-destruction. It seems to be the essence of the film and in itself it is not a bad assumption for the story, though barely original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the skill of making films to take them away. The moment Guy Ritchie realizes this, he seems to be bored with a story and begins to put in red fish: The scene when Statham is knocked by a car - Why? Shooting some scenes like Marvel Comedy Animation ... Again, Why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unanswered questions left at the end of the movie, you can get all 2001-ish about it and try to read them or simply accept that there are no answers and every viewer will interpret things with their own way. My self? I was so boring in the pompous tone of the movie that I just did not care about. To be honest, the end could not come too soon, so I did not have to sit down in this demanding psychobab. <br /> <br /> Lost two hours of my life.
