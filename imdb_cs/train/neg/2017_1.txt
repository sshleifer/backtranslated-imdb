The conspiracy is likely but banal, ie, the beautiful and neglected wife of a rich and powerful man, has a hook with psychotic pieces, then tries to cover up as a psycho stalks and blackmail it. But what evolves from here is incredibly illogical. Despite the resources available to a regular couple who has money and influence, it seems that our privileged hero and heroine have only one domestic, lawyer and local police (who say they can not do anything) while they are struggling with tension and terror. They do not have any private security staff (just fantasy security system that would be wrong), housekeepers or landlords, drivers, etc. There is no apparent means of hiring private uninterrupted nurses to take care of the hero when they suffer life-threatening injuries so husband and wife are in their own house and vulnerable. Our heroine is portrayed as a crank brain and our hero, tycoon, behaves the most unlikely and irrational way. Production is an insult to viewers who have lost their time with this disgrace and crime for losing the talents of talented veterans Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what did they think?). And shame at Lifetime TV for insulting his audience's intelligence for this awkward offer.
