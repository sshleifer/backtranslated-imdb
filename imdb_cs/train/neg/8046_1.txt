No? Do not think so! Well, in that case, you just need to stay away, far from "You want to know the secret" because it's just an indescribable post-"Scream" slasher with absolutely no redemption. This plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are unbearably stupid, the gore-factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can derive from the title, this film is inspired primarily by "Still Knowing what you did last summer" because events take place in a similar environment and the motives of the killers are just as stupid. Why anyone would like to steal spam ideas like "IKWYDLS" is totally a mystery to me. At least the film may be dependent on the precious Jennifer Love Hewitt stand, while the girls in this junk are also uninteresting in addition to the brains. One year after her boyfriend's murder, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other just-thinking college students go to Florida to spend their holiday in a beautiful beach house in the spring. The killer did not take place all year long, but now he is followed by a posse in Florida and begins to piss off while leaving the title message as a business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to quickly find out which face is hiding behind an inexpressibly ridiculous mask, and the attempts of writers to guide you on the wrong path were totally embarrassing. Since the story is so thin, most of the film is a purely irrelevant padding, including sub-parts about the incompetent Florida police and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score. Murder is unexplainably out of the screen (do you hate it when it happens?) There is no free T & A that you will like and you should not begin to change the quality of dialogues. Suffering with such bullshit will only make you aware that the glorious spirit of the 80th Slasher is gone.
