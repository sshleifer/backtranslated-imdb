Casting bone to select: David Jannsen was 38 when he played Robert Drivas' father, who was 31 years old then (I realize he's just out of college, but the tracks in the script are going to be loafer and so he's about 24-25 in the script - - it still gives Jannsen parenting classes at Junior High). I suppose AMA wrote a medical miracle in 1938 in medicine. This movie is not too old, and now it's the main attraction of just seeing the Sin City shot around 1969 and all the constant smoking, strange hair (Drivas has an atomic crest that brings it to the well - a clever violin cousin it) and fashion trends that went with him. If one remembers, LV was not exactly London ... the city then knocked on the crowd in those days. Drivas looks like sexually ambiguous; his dad thinks he could be gay (in a sad irony, Drivas himself died of AIDS at the age of 47) and soy conflicts come from generational problems (and as if we could call a 7-year gap). Sonny's boy wants to be his own man and Dad wants to drag him into the casino (Caesar's palace!), And throws it on the girls (including horny Edy Williams). Interestingly, her son does not feel like she is thought to be gay - unusual for the time, and the cute Brenda Vaccarro is close enough to be placed platonically above him. What nudity is amazingly chromatic - what was needed to get the audience to get the "R" rating in the early MPAA evaluation (which was then G-M-R [16] - and X). The editing is HORRIBLE, and it's a silly, stupid, exaggerated commission (a comedy from the unofficial guards of the late 1960s, who had mercifully disappeared from the map within a few years). Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack trader ... apparently preparing him for the floor manager role in a much better casino two decades later. Do not allow them anything, but they would deal with Mr Rickles' figure with electric tools and a hole in the desert. Best curiosity, far from the usual workload of Joshua Logan. Dos / Dias. Now watch CASINO again ...
