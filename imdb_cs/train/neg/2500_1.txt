Van Dien must be upset with embarrassment in the memory of this extremely poor film, just like every single participant. To be honest, I'm rather embarrassed when I admit that I watched it from the beginning to the end. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original series "Crossroads" and "Prisoner H cells". Most five-year-olds could come up with a more realistic dialogue and more related conspiracy. As for acting, if you can imagine the most porn porno you've ever seen - one of those where the action is omitted by an endless "story" to explain how some pilgrims the old peroxide blonde boiler came - raked several blocks mustaches - you will have some idea of ​​what standard will be played in "Maiden Voyage". Even worse, you can not even move sex scenes quickly because there are none. A horrible movie.
