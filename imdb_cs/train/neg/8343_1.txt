Rescue is the worst so-called horror film I've ever seen. Nothing terribly horrible. He does not deserve to be so gentle in the genre. First, I do not see how so many people can think of this piece of bullshit so great a movie. If I had written something so boring and totally absurd, I would laugh and be too embarrassed to put others in stupidity. Second, acting is terrible and the acting actress is unbearably ugly. Third: The story is upset, its use was earlier, and the excuse that his cheap movie is not a justification. Read the summer on the back of the trunk, revealing the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes of something to regret watching you. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name. All Hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
