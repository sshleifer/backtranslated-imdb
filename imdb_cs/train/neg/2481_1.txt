I have never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but according to this effort in writing and directing, he should keep his daily work as an actress. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize this movie, it was not scary or scary, so it can not be called horror, the plot is so thin that it can not be a drama, it's not that way it can not be a thriller, it's just bad a movie that you should only see when you were a fan of the Blair Witch Project. The people who liked the film used words as "ambiguity" and complex and gentle, but they read something that was not there. Like Blair the Witch, people are afraid because people supposed they should be scared and bought in a trunk that's terrifying. This movie really started well when the family met with the locals after they hit the deer. It seemed like a modern liberation, but then in another 45 minutes (over half the film), nothing happened, the family played for their holiday home, which was very nice and dandy, but not the least fun. It was obvious that local people would be involved in some way in some way, but Essendon obviously does not know how to build tension in the film. Finally, when something happens, it's not clear how his father was shot dead (the nurse said his liver was just grazing) and all the time, this ghost wendigo obviously follows the obvious shooter in a very clumsy fashion with a special third-degree effect. The film is called Wendigo, but no attempt to explain it is a clear way, the film will end up being confused and leave you very dissatisfied, I would save myself with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. No.
