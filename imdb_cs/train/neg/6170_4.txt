This movie starts very slowly, but when the action finally starts, it's a bit to follow. I could not understand why some events were happening, and before they were explained, there were many events, which is a bit confusing. The only thing that really matters about it is the massive amount of blood / gore it has, although there are mostly no special effects. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. The skin crawling sounded as if someone were climbing a pile of sticks. Again, this story has some kind of amateur feeling, just as the writer did not last long before he did it. I feel like this could be a much better movie if the effects got better and more time on the script. I sincerely wish not to see it, not because of bleeding, but because I feel I've lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely horror movies, it's up to you if you do not.
