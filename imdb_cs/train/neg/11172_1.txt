The relentlessly popular film "I Love the Eighties" of 2002 is an unpleasant, idiotic, insulting and utterly disgusting pop-culture mess that was the first in a long line of spooky TV shows that eventually ended the VH1, which was the only real music channel geared to TV! I used to live on VH1 practically until spring or winter, I forgot which one now, since 2002, when such waste began to appear for absolutely no reason. From pure morbid curiosity (I suppose you say), I decided to go and look at her - I see the first night she appeared, even though the ad looked like a bullshit. At least I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed, because of course my expectation was the bottom. The emphasis of this show I found during the first 5 minutes was less in every 80 years and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which I expected to see), but rather more impromptu platform for a number of truly god-awful no-name comedians to show what more than likely they think are their comedic skills * roll eyes * ... just like their lack when you ask me! Now, it's quite easy to understand why none of the idiots ever heard before appearing at this show because they're all so terribly unhappy and miserable in attempting the so-called "humor" that I swear I felt my guts Knot with each rancid one -liner shot one by one! Overall, I have no problem saying that "I love the 1980s" was / is the litter of the smallest denominator and one of the main reasons I've never seen VH1 anymore.
