I remember reading all the terrible, terrible reviews of this movie when it came out. I wanted to see how horrible it was, but three weeks of theater. The only other film he manages is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how horrible it was. I could not think of terrible horrible attention that the movie was still possible. When I see it, I understand. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that this movie is not without some great shots. At the beginning there is a nice shot that shows that a bullet was fired from the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters die in this movie is a little cold to look at it; but he will become old after the first sight. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would try Tare Reid because she's so terribly horrible in this movie that it's unthinkable. And all the roles are played by the curator. Now, if she played a silly, empty sex toy, maybe I could forgive her as she treated her figure. Uwe Boll does not seem to realize that even though he thinks that if he took off his shirt in the movie, people would see it. He simply did not realize that making it in the middle of the film at a very bad moment only made the film even cheerful. And is it such a Mexican song or something like that during a dry humping scene? I could not say it. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst directorial skills you ever see in the movie. I mean, I'm going to make F the house of the dead (and I'm just doing it for very few films), but HotD would get at least B compared to this spoiled piece of junk mail. The film begins with a very, very long narrative that causes instant confusion (and is read with a terrible narrator) and from there the cuts are really stupid. There is one point where Slater and Reid are looking around the building that has been destroyed and the screen is obscured. When he returns, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly the whole army will join them. Huh? <br /> <br /> And someone did not bother to check the bugs in this movie. At one point the glass breaks, but the glass breaks before touching it. Tara Reid's earrings change the colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater leaves from a dead friend, you can see how she got up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about the old tribe releasing the darkness and someone "opens the way" or something like that and all the evil monsters pop up. It's just an excuse for having a lot of gun scenes (technology is so advanced that there is no need for a character in this movie that would not be needed in this movie). <br /> <br /> I bought this movie and hoped to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not speak, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
