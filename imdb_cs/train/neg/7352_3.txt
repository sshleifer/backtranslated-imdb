It was not funny in 1972. It's not fun now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I'm not a crazy movie because it's incredibly sexic - I quote, looking forward to the reaction it generates in the unpleasant personalities of the PC - I'll check it out because it's badly written and acted. The only truly memorable figure is Blakey, which the 25-year-old British people recognize immediately, has been popular with Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br />
