I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to destroy one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need to re-make big screens? Did they ask fans? I wonder how all fans would feel if they did a remake of the Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, who cut out all the music and made it a drama. Do you think she would like it? This movie does not have the same feeling as the original. Of course the original was a bit furious at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main goal was to help people who drove through the city. None of that mattered to the people who shot the film, perhaps they would not even have seen the original performance at all. My big question is, what will they destroy on?
