Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed invalidation. Unsurpassed by the work director, I am well acquainted with the filmmaker, who is allegedly giving away the blessing - Ozu Yasujir. While Ozu does not appear to be magnificent, Hou did not report anything about Ozu's depth of emotion and focus on meaning in closed space. One of the things he lacks is Ozu's attention to the character - Hou is not even "introduced" by his leading figure (the perfect blank page). There are no media or close shots of his people. One of the DVD accessories offers interviews with actors and gives us exactly what Hou does not have - a good look at their faces. There was a great Spanish film Bard called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing Ever Happenes". This would be a much better title for this unnecessary exercise. The whole movie gives us a glimpse of the mysterious Taiwanese composer, whose work we hear on the soundtrack. But the tracks, like everything else, do nothing to help. If you are not a train, this movie has nothing to recommend.
