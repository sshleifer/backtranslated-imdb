Probably the New Zealands Worst Movie Sometimes Made <br /> <br /> Jokes Are Not Funny. It's used from other movies and it's just furious Playing bad though it's a great cast The story is uninteresting and boring It has more cheeses than pizza cottage cheese lovers pizza likes acting It was 1000 times before I came to TV but it was so boring, it could only be 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is angry <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, <br /> <br />
