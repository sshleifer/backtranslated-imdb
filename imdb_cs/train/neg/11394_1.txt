Oh, because I called out loud, it must be the LAMEST film I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that the normally amazing John Cusack was even involved in this soulless, rusty piece of stupidity. Where homeless people in Seattle delivered what is equal to the same message, although on a slightly more subtle, rather mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a hammer, and then continues to wrap it into your psyche for another tiring hour and a half and this is an hour and a half of my life, I will never go back, thank you very much!). It is bad enough that the main characters of this film have the level of emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (in fact, I know better 14 years old ...), with the exception of Jeremy Piven, which was quite pleasant. Just about the first 15 minutes of the movie, starring Kate Beckinsale, that the unpleasant stupidity of the game of throwing all the sensitivity to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I was unconsciously excited. I said my husband Rockstar has more intelligence and at least the characters in Rockstar were not half-dysfunctional like the idiots in this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to watch protagonists who have no clue about the choice in their lives, and feel that they are nothing more than marionettes for fate and whims of fate. How utterly tiring. I am sure that this film is more likely to be enjoyed by those who prefer not to engage in chaotic disorder by more complex life choices and consequently to live responsibly. After all, here is a movie where our hero and the heroine live happily after what after the crash and the suffering in the lives of two other people (namely their fianc√©s) live happily, not to mention other relatives and friends just to get there. <br /> <br />
