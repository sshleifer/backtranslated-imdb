I Like Killer Insect Insect Films that are very fun to watch I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. I met him and I wish I could listen to it because this movie was horrible as he said it was, after he said I was still dying to see how bad it was. what is the cause. <br /> <br /> Only Mike Brady's health worker has a solution, but his theories about killer slugs are laughing at the authorities. <br /> <br /> Only when the beginning of the body begins to rise and the snail expert from England starts snooping around it begins to look like Mike had the right idea after all. This movie as the most overacting you've ever seen the movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (then normal), and they seem to move the scenes quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like a book at all, the book was ten times more scary, ten times worse and had a much more story! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! Because I'm a huge Slug fan, a book and a second book called Breeding Soil! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book, then watch the movie, maybe you like more than I did Give it 2 out of 10
