Who would make this film had to do it like a joke. I think it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen! The snowman killer terrorizes a small town? Give me a break. Love it when it goes with the police. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, borrow it. If you really want a horror movie, stay hell out of this!
