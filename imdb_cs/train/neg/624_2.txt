Director Behind-the-Scenes says he loves horror films. He loves them so much that he is devoted to the film Dario Argento, as well as other influential directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. In fact, dedicating this movie to such a great director is like giving your mother happiness to Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. CAST PEOPLE WHO CAN STOP. Also do not make a 40-year-old person for the role of a misunderstood 18-year-old rebirth. It is right that he is in high school for 22 years. The reaction of people when they watch their girlfriends when their hearts break out is fun. Or as a part, when one gets in the ear to the ear with a corn ear (haha do it) and his girlfriend just goes: "Oh, my ... God?" The scarecrow is quite a character. I'm doing the cars and calling people who are defeated. The movie has one redeemed factor ... oh, wait, no. <br /> <br /> The film is just watching the Rock and Roll trailer on DVD. It covers everything and has a really horrible song.
