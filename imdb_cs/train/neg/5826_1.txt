Slow and nice shots have changed, sometimes with poisoning music (you know Björk) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you did not have enough sleep, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director he decides to bring about the idea of ​​reborn, reincarnation or elsewhere, through S & M paintings: "lovers of spiritual life" cutting each other's knife body. For me, it was very disturbing and in fact changed the general impression of a combination of abstract art and images of modern Japanese secrets. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director are great but weird. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all.
