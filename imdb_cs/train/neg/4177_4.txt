The second film in the tape. Originally called Bloodsuckers, this film was quite average. It's pretty boring in some parts, but there are some good gore effects, but they are not great. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. Vampires are all over the world. Squad V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation), which also has its own spacecraft and is led by Churchill, captured by vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team formed by Quintana (Natasia Malthe plays very hot), novice Damian and insurgents Rosa and Roman Roman plays Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets with Muco Vampire Leader, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans for peaceful living with people because he is bent on world domination. <br /> <br /> Though this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be backing up the DVD player in the near future.
