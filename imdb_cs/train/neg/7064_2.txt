"The son of John Hughes wrote drama in high school!" I thought I checked the IMDb movie information late Saturday night when I found out that I was looking at the BBC2 opening credits. I just watched it and unfortunately it was downhill there on. You probably can not spoil this poor movie, but I leave the spoilers out of this overview ... <br /> <br /> There are a lot of styles for very little substance: unfortunately the style dated too well at the age of eight years after its release. As to the essence, the film seeks to explore an interesting view of the nature of the control in society through the microcosm of school life; but a remarkably meaningful or relevant argument does not appear under the glossy veneer. Characters are drawn in childish broad strokes that fall into the kinds of general stereotypes the writer's father was looking for at the Breakfast Club. Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job and takes a step forward (perhaps relying heavily on montages of information that soon become a difficult device but at least shifts the story) but his efforts do not damage the bad scenario and the bizarre casting (how to connect with " Maddox "when Blake Shields jokes and heats his way through the part, I just do not understand), not to mention the many prospects that make holes (I am for a creative license but when" bad guys "know the identity of" good guys " but they can not prevent them in any way, you have to wonder why this scenario has not previously undergone further reconstruction - this time, did Dad even read it?). I'm sure younger audiences could have a bit of fun out of this movie (and all the power), but it's really better to stick to the Hughes Sr. and if there is an idea of ​​rebellion at school time, y appeal, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfactory examination of the topic.
