I will say it very much - This director is about RAW paintings ... things that most of us are not ready to face before us. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people "get rid of themselves" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to convey the concept of help or release. Though I do not think I could see this movie again, I say the director has a good eye. There were some really nice shots and "movie moments" in the movie (fans, wire fish in my hair), but the story was that I needed more (strictly in that we let ourselves ask "what the hell did they just do to see? "). <br /> <br /> Note: If you tend to fight or vomit easily ... you do not see this movie.
