Generally through a rated movie that boasts a strong cast and some clever dialogue and, of course, Dean Martin's songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, between him and Cher there is no chemistry and it is the main love story. Cher is almost offset by his reactions to Cage's altered accent and beyond the controlling body language. Cage simply will never play its part. He tries everything he can think of, and rather as an actor rather than a real person, and that's what he needs in a love story. Cage had these same performance problems in other roles that require more character like Jimmy Stewart. Cage is still devoted to these roles, perhaps because he likes such films, but his own energy as an actor can not be served, though he has repeatedly attempted to do so. This type of role should leave less interesting actors who would fully engage in the film and spend their energy and considerable talent in more free roles and films where they can be his crazy interesting self.
