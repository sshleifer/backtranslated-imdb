The idea of ​​this film was good. It is a pity that it was not well written. To dismiss Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea, and he did a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. Charisma Kirstie Allye could be great and even showed some options once, but the writer really let us down by making her role a mostly helpless woman. This was totally in contradiction with the highly independent personality she was supposed to be. I do not care about Alley playing. The film should end fifteen minutes before it was. The director cut a dry cow before an incredible final hearing. I will keep it in my collection just as an example of Poitier's performances.
