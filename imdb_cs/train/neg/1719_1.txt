Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the worst amateur movies I've ever seen, and there with Manos, Hands of Fate in terms of bad behavior, unnecessary direction and production values ​​at kindergarten. In this movie, the silly-looking animated dinosaur, which appeared, wakes up after a meteor encounters a lake in Bumblebum, California, and starts eating local hay. In the exciting climax of the creature described by one local "giant fin maker", it stretches that it is hard to climb over the ground to pursue his future lunch until the bulldozer encounters it several times and dies out of boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete fool. One unnecessary subplot shows that he goes to the alcohol store to buy $ 4.75 Ripple; instead of simply buying a bottle, an idiot shooting a treasurer and another nearby man, shooting at a policeman, he is persecuted towards the lake, all in order to lose a monster. The unfortunate close up of the monsters reveals that it is nothing but a piece of polystyrene. There is a fake magician who fights a false British accent (to make it more legitimate), two overflowing tenants of red boat ships, some cheese prehistoric cave art made in crayon and annoying banjo-picking moosic backgrounds. In one painful scene, a fake magician and his hate wife / girlfriend / co-actor can shoot a movie for another 4 minutes by trying to see how the stars can see in the night sky, even though it is a clear daylight. Even with constant fast rewinding, this pain is injured and bad. MooCow says fumigators because this cow's cake really broke! : = 8P
