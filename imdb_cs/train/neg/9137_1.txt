What I can say is a great movie to win the Oscar. The copy should be safe in the safe vault for offspring. Browsing for all high school students around the world should be required. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most ingenious writer / director / producer / chef / guardian / Walmart's supporter, to enjoy the world of cinemas with his art. <br /> <br /> Where to start with this? Each mile of Benny and Arthur was so stunning! And Mraovič like Arthur, so he's so nice that I'm surprised he did not go for Mr. Universe. During the naked scene I could not find myself. I drew this film to my brother and called my phone when he told me how Arthur's bored scene was gay. I'm totally supportive, of course, because of this movie and it's a beautifully crafted tolerance lesson. Why I just burned a church yesterday and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in my glittering pope. Cinematography was the best film. When the Fed-Ex got into the sky in the middle of the palm trees of Vermont, I cried! Why did I never know they have palm trees in Vermont or that people can travel to Fed-Ex aircraft before this film. I opened my eyes to a new range of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraović School, screenwriting, acting, direction, composition, casting, production, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovec, thank you for bringing this creature to the world.
