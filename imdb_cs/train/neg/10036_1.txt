Sometimes I can not understand what directors think when they make a movie ... After watching the greetings (2007), I had a trauma, and I thought they would not do it again. But after many amazing promises, Tashan eventually ended up as a heart attack. Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what happened in the movie? Zero story, predictable conspiracy, lots of Akshay Kumar pieces and nothing interesting except watching Kareena after her major weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music-wise another big disaster ... in a musical album, they spent time putting up pathetic little dialogues about these four jokes and did not think they gave the scene background scenes when Akshay Kumar was doing bits. ..! the song is so pretty, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and it's not in a musical album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I'd rather watch it listen to that background song that goes something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' Overall, very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji tried to talk badly <br /> <br /> Go away to a man, I need to shatter!
