"Visitor Q" is an unsuccessful attempt at a black comedy that focuses on what could be the most dysfunctional family in the world, including physical abuse from beatings to killing incest to sodomy to a necrophilia-laughing mother who nurses her husband and adult daughter etc. The film is so unpleasant that it has received some critical praise and established a small cult. However, with the quality of home video and slapdash production, "Visitor Q" just does not hold even as curiosity. The genitals are blurry and sanitary devices are clearly visible, makeup is terrible and everything else is amateur at best. Waste of time. (C-)
