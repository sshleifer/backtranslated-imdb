Spike Lee must be one of the most rated directors I've ever seen. He is a critic of a sweetheart because he allegedly makes films with a "message", or he is just as bohemian in his approach, making critics who are overwhelmed by the formulation of Hollywood movies eating their stuff just because they are different. <br /> <br /> Summer Sam will not do that. The cinematographic and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is very similar to "Doing the Right Thing". The statement "Guidos" or the PC set of Italian-Americans (of which I have become one) is directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian guy who has chosen to fight a far african American is much more plausible than the cartoon, extensive Italian caricatures that appear here (the figure of John Leguizamo is an exception). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Once Richie entered the movie, I saw a fist in my face and leg in my stomach, and I saw he was accused of being a killer. This character has the highest integrity throughout the movie, so Lee obviously shows what happens to the people who stand out in the crowd (what a white bearded handle!) Someone please please let Spike Lee live on all the basketball games he wants. So maybe he would take too long to choose a movie camera for a long time, and we will not have to be exposed to his own significant driving force and in addition, they will not have to see critics (some of which I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh emperors without clothing.
