This sci-fi adventure is not the best and in no way worse. I agree with the claim that bad science fiction is comic. Extraordinary pink tones and unusual special effects make it a favorite later, later, later audience. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight strange giant amoeba - like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. Cast includes Les Tremayne, Nauru Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfort and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you nod for a moment. I agree to add it to the list of classical cults so I can not miss it.
