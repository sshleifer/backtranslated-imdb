This is one of those films I could just sit down. Charlotte Henry is all right - in fact, all the actors were all right. The problem consisted of script, dialogue, direction, edits, sets, and special effects. It was 1933, but it really shouted. Part of the problem is that actors such as Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there are faces crying for recognition that was not forthcoming). The film just collapsed without coherence. Much of Lewis Carrols's ghost, humor and continuity are missing. What a shame! It's such a great book. I would recommend the Disney 1951 version.
