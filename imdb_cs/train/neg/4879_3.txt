Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? The answer is yes; one who is not interested in the whole picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive frontman for illegal business - but it is a potboiler with a bad scenario and script and just does not work. Was it considered a good "B" in 1942? It's hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of this film is the cast that includes several famous faces from the 1930s and 1940s such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett, and Robert Armstrong (I always reject Richard Cromwell as a weak one in "The Bengal Lancer Lives" so I did not count on him ). <br /> <br /> You can not recommend it and give it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, you will get a root channel.
