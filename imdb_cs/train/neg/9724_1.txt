Bad Tobe Hopper. He directed the classic horror "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything he has done has been terrible. This is probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) capture ... or something like that. Almost original idea (someone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything is done wrong! Crazy acting (even Dourif!), Asinine scenario, highest production value, dirty special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! He must be missing ... not even laughing.
