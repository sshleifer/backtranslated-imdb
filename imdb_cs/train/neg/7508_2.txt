I wish Spike Lee to choose another title for his movie. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is the infamous serial killer Dav Berkovic. It is not. It's a rude, eerie portrait of NYC's life in the hot summer of 77 when Berkowitz was terrorizing this city. The film follows several young fictional characters in the Italian-American neighborhood and their reaction to Sam's threat. There's Vinny and his wife Dionne; there are Richie and Ruby, and a few other characters. The problem is that these characters are not sympathetic. They are routinely annoying and sometimes unbearable. Lee then connects their high energy, chaotic lives that are filled with anger, lust, and total turmoil. Between Vinny and his wife there are at least two prolonged combat scenes, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabbets ... Again and again, I was still wondering: where is the film editor? , the film brings a chance to say any real sense of fear or fear that results from the threat of Son Sam, who is too in the background. Lee is more successful when he shows another kind of threat coming from neighboring groups. <br /> <br /> The game is equally good. The fact that, combined with 70th disco music and a lot of attention to costumes and production design, you really feel like you are in the NYC district of the US in 1977. Film Atmospheric Authenticity, however, is not nearly enough to evade the harsh , an exaggerated script about the lives of highly irritating people.
