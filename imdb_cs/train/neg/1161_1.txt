As a cast member I was a member of the band in all the basketball games, I wanted to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed because it was forbidden in Oregon. This was caused by the producer and the director who broke the contract with the University of Oregon where she was shot dead. It appears that the U O character was displayed. While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several dishes with occupants and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable because I was one of the worst men I've ever met. Good time for young 20 years. Undoubtedly, not what campus life really was like in the late 1960s and early 1970s over what Hollywood might think. A trombone player from Oregon
