In particular, this film is not a comedy; if he really is forced to laugh himself. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. The game is not bad, but it's not strange. There's a Lucky Luke comedian about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting time with this movie. Religion and dogmas are not the best sources for good comedy, and this film no more than confirms this rule. There is a similar theme of comedy '' Home Teachers ''; it had some good moments. My last comment is: Do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring movie.
