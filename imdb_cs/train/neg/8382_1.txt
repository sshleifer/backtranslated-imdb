It was a Bugs Bunny caricature called "Baby Buggy Bunny," which was exactly this conspiracy. Finster, with his face in his face, robbed the bank, and the money in the carriage rolled and fell into Bug's rabbit. He dressed like a kid to get to Bugg's hole to get the money. The scene in "Little Man", where he looks in the bathroom the mirror of a stick with a cigar in his mouth is directly from the cartoon. It was a cheerful 5 minute cartoon; not the whole movie. If you really care about it, buy the DVD Bugs Bunny. It was much more original for the first time (1954). Plus, you get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to start!
