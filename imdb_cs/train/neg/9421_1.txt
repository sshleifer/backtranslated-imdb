If you liked watching Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, then you could enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie so bad that it would never be possible to distribute. I can only confirm the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is wiser, but the night and dark scene movies were so badly made that everything looks red. At first I thought my DVD players were dirty. It was not. If you insist on watching, I recommend that you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you do not, you will never be able to go through the film. If you do, it will simply remind you that poor film students are trying to revise the Pulp Fiction style.
