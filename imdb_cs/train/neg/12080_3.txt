I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was anxious to see this episode. First I will comment on the movie, then the episode MST3K. Recipe for this movie: Take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespearean material and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well and then empty your life and move until you are boring and lifeless. Protect yourself in a cold, large stone boiler. Film, I give 3 out of 10, because actors at least deserve a bit of credit. Well, now is the episode MST3K. I admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand it was the reaction of several other pupils. However, when I watched it for the second time, I realized that I had gone through a series of smart links and good lines for the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes several views to capture each line. Give her a second chance and see what I mean. Episode MST3K: 7 1/2 of 10.
