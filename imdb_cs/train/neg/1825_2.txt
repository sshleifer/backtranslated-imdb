I'm not sure what. I could not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want it to be tense. But I really could not laugh at this movie. For me it was just no fun. Some parts looked like Ben Stiller and Jack Black too hard. Just because you gave two very entertaining men together does not mean it will be a great comedy. Some movies should not be done. That's one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least still. But I was not overwhelmed. I'm sorry, but I can not give you anything less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
