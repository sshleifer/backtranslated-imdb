As you all know, JIGSAW did not get to Blackbuster due to Full Moon's own staff member, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all video chains. He recently released BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He persuaded the buyer Blackbuster not to take JIGSAW and double the number of BLEED. As a result, JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever and as we all know, JIGSAW is good gold. I invite you all to go to BLEED on the Internet and vote for a movie that has damaged JIGSAW and all your talents. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote for it (if you do not already have it). We must get JIGSAW at least at 8 or 8.5, and BLEED at about 2 (so putting it on the Internet is 100 worst movie listing). Also, try to persuade friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone is doing well - Matt
