After being very entertained by the performance of Mr. Brosnan as cad in "The Tailor of Panama" (I appreciate 10/10 in full extent: casting, acting, script, story, editing, tempo, music, emotion, etc., I was very disappointed, it's a script that does not read the film, vulgar because it's vulgar, it's a bankruptcy in all respects that "Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying, blaming it for writing and directing the screen. the theater was waiting for a "good part." It never was not I was not crying, although one line of dialogue made me smile, it cost $ 7?
