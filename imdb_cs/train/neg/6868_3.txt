OK, surely as an Orthodox woman who lives in Boro Park, I will be a little bit interested in this movie. It seemed, however, that Boaz Yakin had the only purpose in filming this film to be an Orthodox bash. With our wigs, modest clothing and separate seating, we are a very easy target. Yakin never managed to overcome the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi says Sonia loves him more than G-d or their parents. Then deliberately defies his father's order not to swim because of ill health. 2. Sonia buys her son's belly. Why would a Hassey woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe she had never been involved before. Let's look at this, even the reforming Jews hold the bris milah ceremony nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? It is to satisfy the passionate woman in her bed and not to kiss her on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to be married for over a year and just now they noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little bit organized marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first boy that her parents are preparing. The community will also not avoid if the marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the treasury store wrong, she did not have to go through Scandinavian brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came more than convulsed than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat down and waited for things to happen, then complained that she did not like it. This is not an attitude to the environment; it is the irritation of the stereotype. Honestly, I think she got what she deserved.
