Unfortunately it is true. "The Legion" reveals with absolute clarity the parameters of irreparable failure of Daneliuc. <br /> <br /> As has been said, the author has lost the ability to combine his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Manically interested in the mechanical trick of collecting random news items and joining them without legitimacy, he collects only a disordered stack of events, unable to follow the smallest story. The level of the script is similar to the amateur play "Cântarea României" about the famous assumptions of socialist realism - just turned by the reverse: while the Communist line dictated a narrow interest only with positivism and sugar festivity, Daneliuc is so enthusiastically obsessed with negativity and disgusting scatology. The content of the ideas is zero and the "message", child and didactic, at the kindergarten level. Unfortunately, he also forgot the most basic professional principles. He is no longer able to organize a dramatic situation, order it on the right scene, shoot it properly and adjust it according to the simplest rules of film grammar. His level of storytelling is similar to phrasing like: "Holy man is not right and all people are shit!" What a tremendous distance from the impressive artist 1976-1984, which created unique works such as "Cursa", "Microphone test", "Hunting fox" - even "Cruise" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit gloria mundi .. .
