It was a terrible movie. There was no story. At the top of everything, when they could not explain blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw a few foreigners! I hate it when directors (or whatever) exhaust their ideas and then accuse foreigners! Watch this movie if you like it. But do not say I warned you. Two things: How could Vinny "welcome" when he did not have a tongue? It is a shame that Mr. Jones did not have a bigger role. The second thing that helped me, why we saw that Vinny Jones had twisted them off and put them in a blue liquid, and they no longer have a different role. Why not? I do not like to show anything and it has nothing to do with the story. In a nutshell. Bad story. I would not waste time - I wish I could see the Mirrors instead.
