I just want to make a clear thing - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really leaves him. His acting is still excellent, he is still charming as always and still looks great. But the film itself is a load of rubbish! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it, it's over crazy ... you're always waiting to run away with a friend who has his own chap, it's a little weird. Me and my family (who sat down and watched the film with me) were also postponed by the soundtrack to the film; sometimes music simply did not match what was happening in the scenes. But this was not the worst aspect of what I thought was a very disappointed film. I could forgive the main lady, but I could forgive the wild creatures that were put into the mix and I could forgive the wrong choice of musical accompaniment, but her choice was to cut out the entire middle of the movie and jump straight to the end ??? The end was apparently planned from the very beginning, but as it gets there, it remains unspoken. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: instead, buy a poster.
