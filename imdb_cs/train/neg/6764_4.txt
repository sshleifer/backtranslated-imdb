(1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It's an unusual picture of Oliver Stone but when I read that when I was filming drugs, I did not need any further explanation. "Natural Born Killers" is a risky, crazy, versatile movie that we do not get too often; strange, psychotic, artistic images. "Natural Born Killers" is basically a story about how two mass murderers have been promoted and celebrated by the media; there is a great scene where the interviewer challenges some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "The murder is bad .... but if I were a mass murderer I would be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes this with the situation of "Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that has transformed them into these monstrous killers. Most of Oliver Stone's films explore the shortcomings of America, a country that the director loves and admire. I think "Natural Born Killers" refers to the influence of mass media, technology and obsession as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) over things like mass murderers and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> Murray Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are surprisingly executed by two outstanding actors who enter the lives of two of the most brutal murderers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (Mickey's survival) - Mickey says in his jail interview that other species commit murder, as humans distort other species and use the environment; the script is interesting, but it is doubtful how much this film feels in the sense that it thinks about society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of the two-hour bloodshed that we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the movie takes place in the safest prison; we see the hard reality of prison life; senior positions, etc., overcrowding of prisons - perhaps Stone casts doubt on the future, the way society drives. <br /> <br /> Two more interesting characters; First of all, a reporter who runs a show about "American Maniacs" and is obsessed with strengthening ratings that goes somewhere to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is Police Officer Scagnetti, a mad, perhaps sadistic officer loved by Mallory - also possessing a strange obsession with mass murderers because his mother was killed during the Waco, Texas Charles Whitman massacre. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is excellent; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; the green color, which is obvious of all, is green, recalling the illness of the sick (in the drugstore when looking for a rattlesnake). Working with the camera is crazy; reluctant, buoyant, needs a certain determination to take advantage of it and accept it. Very unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. "Natural Born Killers" does not care about the existence of mad killers, it questions and how we can power this attribute as a public ... <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> While the above rating sounds quite positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote a film script, was not pleased with the changed scenario and asked for his removal. I see why. While somewhat interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a picture mess. <br /> <br /> 4/10
