Ira Levine's Broadway interview comes to screen with almost no meat on his bones, a mysterious conspiracy with just a few tricks and twists, but no one has to worry about it. Frustrated writer Michael Caine plans to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it on as his own; his unsuccessful plan may include the murder of a talented child in the hands of his affiliated husband. The first act, in which everyone is mentioned, is unbearably dead, with Caine doing everything actor can keep up. Dyan Cannon is a miscast like his wife (she's too smart and smart to go as a ditz), and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems extremely uncomfortable as a better writer. These three figures and annoying neighbor Irene Worth are so undefined that what happens after the meeting is barely registered until the second hearing began. Sidney Lumet's direction is terrible and fuzzy, the design proposal is incomprehensible and poorly illuminated, and the final is a complete disaster. The actors tried to give the script some substance, but with such thin material we see their efforts. * 1/2 from ****
