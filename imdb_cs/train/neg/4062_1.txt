Several films have left me feeling uncomfortable, and that's not a compliment. Since I've seen it in the theater (as it is, I can only wonder), I have undergone 90 million hateful, derived garbage, the main impression was a bit like this other bad movie "Do not Take the Phone" - but worse. The violation of everything, rape, and everything is displayed without any distances (as opposed to strong things as the "last house on the left") and total disdain for (endowed) victims and all concerned, so the viewer is considered a sadistic voyeur. Finally, I felt like a shower. No credit to the director
