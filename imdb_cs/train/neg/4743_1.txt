I'm here again at your local shopping mall (of course, because it's a place where high school kids hang out !!!!!) to show how terrible the "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is !!!!! To show how bad this DCOM wit ... <br /> <br /> ... we take the four Sumo wrestlers and take them into this photocopy. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How terrible it is ????? It's so bad that Disney Channel pays its money, again with these exciting, but decisive, 10-second promos, which has the audience wondering, "WHAT IS IT STAY?" And then suddenly, when it comes, for one, it not only received a higher TV rating than usual, but it was only seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once everybody !!!!! In addition, this movie is about high school and the like, and believe me I will not go any further with what's different ..... Say ch ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
