Of course I was "GI Jane" not seen from the election. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around the house of a former girlfriend. GI Jane loses his credibility right now by trying to convince the viewer that this is a potentially real scenario, of course not. As a result, the story becomes automatically bound by limitations, limits the amount of humor (which is not any) or fun scenes and soon becomes too serious. The film is therefore extremely boring and predictable. "GI Jane" fails where other action movies go, mainly because movies such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, but never be different. They are escape and therefore fun. "GI Jane" tries to be real and fails. It's a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very untrustworthy story, an unimaginable acting and the only reason why I gave him 2/10 instead of 1/10 for some technical work.
