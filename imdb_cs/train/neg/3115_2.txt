I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt it was consistent. Night Listener is undoubtedly one of the most exquisite films I've ever seen. Nothing happened in this movie - I never cared about any character, did not buy the mysterious type of plot, did not care how it ended ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no excitement, no tension, nothing. The most important thing is (no spoilers - it's nothing to spoil): a man running through the window, a dog barking outside the hotel room, the car going through some rough terrain, and the carriage begs to be a corner. <br /> <br /> I really liked "One Hour Photo" and I was hoping Williams would have a similar role, but unfortunately it hurt. Even more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should feel compassion with the characters, but it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I might even give him 1/10, but this score is reserved for remake producers
