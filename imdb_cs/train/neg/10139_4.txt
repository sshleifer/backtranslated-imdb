You have to pass it on to Steven Seagal: whatever his mistakes are, he has a good taste for women. If you select Seagal, it is likely that there will be one or more beautiful women. And they usually do not work as mere eye candy; engaging in action and fighting, shooting with weapons, killing knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" features duo Cery Payton (who has a very sexy face, with perfect lips that match Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones and finds time to get them they also involved a bit of lesbian in the battle! And if it seems to me that I have too little time to talk about them, it's because the rest of the film, though passive, is so insincere that it's hard to find anything else to talk about. Paradoxically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as though he could not even bother trying to pretend he cares. It is a military type of shareholder with very few battles and does not assume his role (the fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which can explain his almost offensive sleeps.
