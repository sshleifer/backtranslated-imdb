What disappointment, especially from the point of view of the budget available, available technical resources and talent. This is not a basic rule for sci-fi / drama that would create a willing interruption of mistrust in the audience. POA 2001 creates a credible start that brings us, but Mr. Burton forgets that his viewers have working brains. Above the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the worthlessness of blocking people, the ease of their escape, the extraordinary ability of riding (astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly filled with a tilt), massive and immediate human rebellion are all too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never gives any sense of real fear, danger, or ascension to this world turned upside down. Compare to the original in which Nudity Chuck Heston metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his painting of events. The unified Wahlberg retains his modesty but also his apparent sense of direction and control in a state that is essentially insane and we never believe in his prosperity. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in danger. Tim Burton should have used a f / x budget for some competent scriptwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have ever bothered to dispel scenarios and directors threatening the threat. Let them go. Trained monkeys could do the same as they did in the 2001 Monkey Planet. I bet that repeated tours of this effort will not exist. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step to imagination. Another opportunity was lost.
