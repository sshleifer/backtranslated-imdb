I watched the anime, but I'm not a hard fan; and I do not manga. I say this because many reviewers who perceive a lyrical film about this movie seem to have this background. I saw "St John's Wort," and although it is not a masterpiece in any imagination section, I chose "Shinobi," especially when everyone seems to love him. <br /> <br /> I saw it this afternoon and struggled very hard to keep track of it. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow water scenes, autumn leaves on trees, even CGI flashing eye - majestic. I liked hawks, costumes, even some combat scenes, but overall it was dull as dirt. It seemed as if someone had taken "Romeo and Julie" - the translation even mentions that the stars were overcome by lovers - and tossed some "X-Men" for good. The two characters split the powers of Wolverine - the guy dressed in the bear costume had his claws and the gray-haired guy had the ability to heal. Then you have a girl who has a kiss kiss - that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why are they giving these women such stupid powers? Poison girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Man, that's great power for you. And the other girl can make mistakes from this yellow dust that shakes her hands. The other woman, one of the star lovers, has the power of a hypnotic look. Wow. I did a little bit of it until the end of the movie when I handed it over quickly and saw a little more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare it to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make this mistake. They can share similar ends, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is created by amateur - other films are made by experienced filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I think I'm avoiding this movie if you are not 12 to 18 years old.
