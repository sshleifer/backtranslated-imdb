It's not a very good movie, but according to the information it's quite accurate when displaying the techniques of torture. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and it was done so efficiently, with surprising sincerity. No matter what technical mistakes exist (and there is plenty) by looking at it, you will see a forgotten corner of forgotten war and some pretty ugly things - again ugly because it's going north of the DMZ and not the Guantanamo Bay. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think none of the Korean veterans have induced torture while running in office and if you are watching movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to movies in Vietnam. I do not know if there are people in the 54s who are captured in the concepts of World War II (boys tend to get a lot of rage) or war or what, but it's interesting to see from the same system that would be 16 years later to shoot movies like "Go Tell The Spartans ".
