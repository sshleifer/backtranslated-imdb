If you thought the original of 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse than asking? Well ... at least in the first you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons, and sexy new voice for Ripley, it's unfortunately the same sad story. Everyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line is in the story. And for anyone who did not see the first ... well realize that you are happy that you just watched once. Perhaps Hollywood will try again in the next 23 years.
