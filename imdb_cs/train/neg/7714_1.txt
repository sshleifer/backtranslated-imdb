Damn, damn, MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like this cheap parody of the 70th Cheese. The idea that huge hordes of murderous tomatoes destroy the US is a great idea, and despite the fact that the moon brings some decent giggles, a horrified look at the terrified extras running away from large, apparently fake tomatoes. This movie, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the previous attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 1980s and 90s thanks mainly to Airplane !. This, like underwater spoofs, is pretty poor. Many humorous attempts are hard to fail and cause many moans. But thanks to the hordes of ravens, the unpleasant song "Love Puberty" and the awesome scene of the crash of the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, they provide some goods, though largely for improper reasons. There are many things wrong in this movie ... and so good, it's hard to explain. A lot of people also enjoyed it because Tomaty returned to two Moore movies and a cartoon series !! Large portions of time spent from tomatoes are rather dull. And dig those 70th clothes, buddy! ; = 8) These tomatoes are salty and cheesy but worth laughing or two; MooCow says she will grab pizza and pop in tomatoes! : ??
