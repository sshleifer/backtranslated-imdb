Most episodes in season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison with the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, because the programs really had decent stories. Most of the stunning stories are well boring .. not amazing in the least .. to rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I heard Season 2 of this series is much better .. also for some reason DVDs are cut out by Ray Walston, which further reduces this compilation. One of the amazing things is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... But most of the stories are very predictable and the series could be better with twists and turns that left you thinking ...
