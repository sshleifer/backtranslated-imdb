I'm impressed with some reviews of this movie. The only place that seems to be true is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The story is extremely lazy. It's not scary. People who think that because Sarah Michelle Geller is playing, it's like The The Grudge should forget about it. This movie is more like dark water, except that it is even more predictable and slower than that. I was very disappointed with this film. Do not worry or I'm not interested. Let's see, this type of plot was killed at this point, for example, the dead are trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, Change, etc. It seems to me that the only ones today writes original horror films, they are Japanese and Koreans. Hollywood movies are so cynical to make money without the audience behaving. They are simply thrown away
