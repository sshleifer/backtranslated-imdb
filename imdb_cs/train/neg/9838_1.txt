This movie is scary. Dignified combat scenes or not, acting is really bad, as if you could say he reads his lines from the card. With the painful delivery of the line all in occupation. Think about how you play in high school and how to renounce the apparent lack of fluency in the actors' interactions (strange pauses between different character lines combined with fast line delivery by others). If the movie was all it could be, but a lot of the movie contains a plot of conspiracy and Guy's family style, improbable cutting (oh, wow, they are badly done). I suppose they are trying to be fun with them, but again it was rumored that a lot of college / university college students accepted the afternoon and tried to create a funny Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now on the battle scene. They are not too bad, given the quality level we see everywhere in the movie. Nothing big, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters (Nothing like Drunken Master). The fight has a supernatural sensation, with LOTS cuts at different angles with obviously different positions of interest. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of your friends who are dealing with this very, very cheap production. Which guy could you ask? And the same person he wrote, directed, produced and watched the masterpiece of the high school.
