`Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic, but also curious about the provocation of his" Twilight Zone "-sh. Here the general rule applies - and this continuation does not correspond to its predecessors. It's worse than not being at all with him. <br /> <br /> "Recovering" explodes on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In the initial few seconds, the first impression is generally good, because Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately afterwards, the movies are tapped. After the catastrophic first 45 minutes, he gradually acquires the momentum when he enters the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle. But it loses at all speeds when it reaches a 14-minute car tracking sequence and gets worse with a big darting twist at the end. The worst of all is the excessive "Zion Rave" scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with conspiracy, it is also a pathetic excuse for pornography and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The Aspect of Matrix culture was a good addition, but in `` Reloaded '' they rolled over to make it look dull. At first there was an interesting conspiracy, but here it is too linear to be interesting. The film is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realizing how it is really empty. He works on the wrong principle that the bigger is better. It seems that the `Matrix 'franchise has quickly got into special effects that have accelerated wreckage with other franchises, such as the Saga Star Wars. The action standard is largely poor. The best character, of course, is Agent Smith Hugh Weaving - the only thing that's a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects there is only a small space that would have a big impact. Nominee Academic Prize Laurence Fishburne is limited to a monotonous mentor with a bad interview. Carrie Ann Moss's part as an action chicken could have been much better done by any other actress. <br /> <br /> The bad movie, called Matrix Reloaded, is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one are unlikely to go into it. This is just for fans who are hard. Even in the sub-genre of the movie about bonanza with a special effect (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.) It's still bad. My Rating IMDb: 4.5 / 10.
