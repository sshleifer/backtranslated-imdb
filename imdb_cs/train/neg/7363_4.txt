The only reason I saw Shakedown was that Erika Eleniak had it. She is sexy as always, but she plays the second violin for Wolf Larson. It's a shame because it has more abilities than it can afford. The film mostly consists of endless shots that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see that bad boys armed with machine guns are constantly losing Larson and is armed only with a revolver (which NEVER draws bullets) quite easily. Earthquake effects are decent, but there are also many blurry movements and bad explosions of CGI. As a psychological "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman seeks, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he has to dispose of is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has some) would even want to give this man a look, for others it barely stands for a lease. (* 1/2)
