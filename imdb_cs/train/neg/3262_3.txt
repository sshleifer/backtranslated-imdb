I was fortunate enough to meet George Palle (and still have a signed DS poster: TMOB) shortly after the release and asked him why he decided to make the film "Camp". Before he could answer, the two studio pants captured and lectured me about how the studio "knows the best" and how "no one would take such a movie seriously." For four years I've read Bantam prints through a friend (70-year-old ComiCon recollectors of Blackhawk and his band, we've been with him for a couple of years), and we had more hope than what we got. <br /> <br /> The Flack insisted that no big adventure would ever be done seriously, so the "camp" was the only way. Several other fans leaped to my side and Pal listened as best he could. At the end of this little event, Pal came to us and apologized and wished he could do more and more. STAR WARS gave lies to flacks, and one year after the death of Pal Spielberg and Lucas he proved that Dr. Savage could easily be another big film franchise ... if it was not for flacks. <br /> <br /> Lose memory or history Doc and the movie would cost 6/10 as nothing more than a soulless popcorn dealer. But the destruction of this heritage was no less abomination than killing a child in a crib. <br /> <br /> Doctor Savage can still get to the screen and survive the inevitable comparison of poorly-informed Indians Jones, but it has to be done with all seriousness and seriousness to get the glory we should expect from the 1st American superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, there was a simultaneous shot, but most of the time she made shots and very few actors. And yes, there is one Ron Ely leaf that jumped over a brick wall and something on his shoulder was shot with a specially built bronze pistol. Ely is wearing a chest of drawers over a white shirt with a bronze tie and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the wells that were accompanying George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for a convention, they beat idiots by the side of their head and called them idiots who are. At that time, dorkknobs and Fu Manchu were making lanes and sackcloth trousers and carrying the Paramount portfolio.
