I never heard of it, then I found it a man with a deadly lens I heard, but I did not see. Connery's presence made me buy, and that's not good. It's going to be a cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but that's just not funny if you do not find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It appears as a flat 70-year-old thriller up to the last ten minutes when it emerges. There are many, many flat scenes in Whitehouse between the president and his helpers who do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long and the first half was adjusted downwards to get the whole ransom ransom from a nuclear bomb and a suicide bomber who I think laughs but funny. The movie location is great, but the studio looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did it. Just laugh: Connery tosses the wig before he puts on his helmet and jumps out of the plane. It does Never say Never again look like genius.
