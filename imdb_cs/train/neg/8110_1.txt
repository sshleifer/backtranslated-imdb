I think Phillip Kaufman read a recipe note from the Kundera novel and then decided to make this film. Okay, of course it will not have an original strike. Kunder's novels are great due to his handling of narrative, his ability to enter and come out of the stories he creates. This movie will not even try! One dream sequence of Tereza, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is redesigned and has no meaning at all. Daniel Day-Lewis looks very similar to Ben Stiller (I know this is not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of Hollywood literature.
