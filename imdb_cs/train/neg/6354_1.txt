Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogue or characters that differ from each other clearly. This is the case of Melinda and Melinda, where all the characters speak with the general pseudo-sophistication of Allen and have problems and views that are not related to anyone other than the four-member radius from where Allen lives. They also share the same curious condition that they can afford more million dollar Manhattan flats that seemed to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for life. the character that exists beyond this boring attitude is Will Ferrel as a substitute for Woody Allen. Though he just does not look like making Woody Allen an impression (like Kenneth Branagh in God-terrible "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that real Woody, when he played himself in his best movies. <br /> <br /> The final result is another in the chain of self-service boreholes by a once-great filmmaker who has been studying his former legacy for several years now.
