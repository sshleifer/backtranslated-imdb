It's really quite a strange movie ... First of all we have an ex-American gymnast trying to sneak an actor (or something like that) and it seems to be the only role he ever got (that's what I know); for good reason. While it plays a role well enough to keep an interest, it's a rather sloppy and flat performance. Secondly, we have the BEST sound effects we've ever used in movies! I am not joking. This in itself makes the film extremely comical, but in that unpleasant way. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally decent actor's accompanying cast (including the required hot chick!), really not such a bad story and some cool visuals; dialogues, combat scenes involving gymnastics (merry!), and the overall realization of the plot is weak. This movie would barely be better as a network television movie (too bad Fox was not in 1985). It's one of those films that are just bad, but you can not resist watching and even enjoy it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on the late night of television and cable.
