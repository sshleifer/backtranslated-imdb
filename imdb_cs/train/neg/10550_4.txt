After being a big fan of ten-minute episodes of T.V "Stella Street," I was expecting this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I felt very disappointed. I was appalled by the fact that almost all of the gag and the liner were directly lifted from television episodes and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing if they ever told actors and could not bother to call them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I split up with my hard earned money to watch the same jokes again. SPOILERS * The plot of the film begins with Stella Street (the normal English street in Surrey), gradually populated by "the most famous people in the scene and screen of the past forty years", including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All street celebrities are excluded from their wealth by a local cheater and are forced to live as dwarves and ordinary people working in the classroom. There are some nice moments, but rather the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it quite boring. * END OF SPOILERS * In the episodes of T.V all characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but Ronni Ancona is added to cast. I think it was a mistake. Their pretending was not fun, and it felt like her characters were part of the story just to do something. If you were not a fan of Stella Street's episodes, you can find this movie fun. But if you were a fan, I think you can leave and feel a little cheating. 4/10
