This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your movie TV series look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on the book of one and only Britney Spears and her mother this is waste with nothing other than Virginia Madsen (I hope you paid well) to save her. The story of a red-hot heat that earned a scholarship at a prestigious music school is scarce, but Mrs Spears's pedaling car wears music for the consumer and generally agrees that it must be a lower forehead. There is nothing good with all the moves as predictable as the night of the next day. Never ever.
