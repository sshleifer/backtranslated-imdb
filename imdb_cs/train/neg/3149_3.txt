He was an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I bought this document, which she believed was that it finally made a record of how really talented and brilliant Ed Wood was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointment that is a self-centered, conflicting, contradictory compilation of bitter self-extinguishing has-beens. <br /> <br /> Where people remember Ed Wood Jr., do people actually remember the other cousin of that guy with a cassette that knew someone who was in Plan Nine From outer space? <br /> <br /> It seems that just as Ed Wood came to a renewed interest, these people come from "Wood"! Just to make bad moves to someone who really gave them a chance when nobody else will be! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people should get rid of the fact that they did not receive the $ 75 they were promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative creator who knew how to have fun. In fact, it was all he lived for. You can giggle when you see Ed's movies, but somehow you realize you're laughing at him and not with him. <br /> <br /> But I turn ... Back to the movie by hand. If you're looking for the movie ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not have it. If you want a movie about horrifying old actors, it's the movie for you!
