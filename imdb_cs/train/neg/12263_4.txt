Seeing this movie, as I did for the first time on Turner Classic (which is referred to as "Dangerous Women"), can multiply your appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez had to be paid a grin. I hope he remembered his dentist and his salesman Brylcre in his will; they made him an actor. All women are good, but nothing better. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who are competent to deliver many individual tikes, but almost nothing in the atmosphere of the changing atmosphere of their successors in roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow overcame the remarkable seediness of their characters in remak; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not quite stingy; lying there like a big piece of ham. His main value today reminds us that great films such as "41" Falcon "have not just happened, I'm rated 4 on scale 1 to 10, especially for camera and supporting players.
