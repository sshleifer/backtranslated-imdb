Fans of feature films have to endure a lot of scary movies recently. Blood Surf shamefully joins the list of stupid, superfluous titles about fools and the horrors of ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. The crocodiles are particularly successful because we have had to deal with the inexorable 'crocodile' (Tobe Hooper driven by disappointment) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is just as bad as these other movies and? extra ?? rather it exaggerates exaggeratedly. The salt water crocodile is allegedly 90 years old, more than 30 ft long (!) And kills for fun! During the movie, he enjoys eating a lot of stupid surfers and puddles who have come to seek new excitement by surfing in crowded shark areas. The only beautiful aspect of this film is its tropical location. Although it is a completely unsuitable environment for such a movie, the lagoons and nature look amazing. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. It's a little bleeding, but everything looks fake and ridiculous. Dialogues are so painful that you can listen to them! You will not believe any of the lines that these actors say! I know that surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so silly about themselves! Soon in the movie, one of the characters denotes Jaws as a "mechanical toy," but croc looks at it at least ten times less than the real Spielberg's big white shark. The visual effects of "Blood Surf" are amateur and the massacres do not work. I'm not going to say too much about acting because it's secondary in movies like this one. The girls look sexy in their wet shirt and their breasts joyfully bounce as they escape from the beast. You guessed correctly: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. It is so bad that it will become fun again. But "funny" for another reason than James Hickox intended.
