This film may have poor production value, but that's also what's so good. Special effects are coarse and well done. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. It is super hot and has a good scene as well. Robert Prichard as gang leader is cheerful, just like other members. This film is actually trying to say when it says nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Satisfied comedy, gross movie.
