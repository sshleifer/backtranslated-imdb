Spend time in a different way, even homework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, funny rhymes that are Dr. Seus, they are not there. Very miserable way to throw in the evening. My kids, 4-16, laugh a little at the beginning, the younger people get bored with it and go to the Barbies game, and older ones leave ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and made the dishes. So I finished it myself. It was the worst movie "kids" I've seen. If you want to watch a funny movie for Shrek 2 kids, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. KEEP THIS FILM. It's not funny, not cute, make-up cats is the only good thing about it and you can see it on the label of the disc.
