I also heard how I read all the brass reviews and comments on how this film deserves the Oscars for the best picture, so I saw it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews, you are taught by members of the US Army who worked in Iraq in Iraq how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflect my own thoughts; how the film was played by me - a complete civilian - was thinking about himself, "say, WHAT? There is no way this would happen." 2) There is very little what is actually going on in the conspiracy. The new boy gets rid of a bomb that replaces the one who was killed (a death that is not clearly explained). The new guy got his adrenaline rush from his job. His attitude threatens others. AND IT IS DONE! 3) This film is not as exciting as it claims. To have the tension, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally strong, try to rent Go Tell The Spartans, who is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who personally told me it was a movie that was immensely proud and the one he considered one of his finest works and which was still upset, was largely ignored due to the exaggerated anthem of the Apocalypse now) or the old black-and-white classic war Sink The Bismark, the English movie is incredibly hearty. DO NOT TAKE YOUR TIME ON Hurt Locker.
