I'm a big fan of the Westerns, but this one ... everywhere, what a smell! I think the thing that turned me off the heel was an unpleasant dialogue. I think I could write a better dialogue than if I were in the eighth year. And poor actors! Because of this terrible dialogue, no one came looking for anything but ridiculous. I really do fun. Some of them are a little better than what you would get in Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably a "big" star in this movie that you would like to praise if you call him B-Western. This should be called B-minus Western. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times alongside Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. In order to appear in the car, this poor must have been something he'd been trying to throw for the rest of his life. One unpleasant thing about this film is that all men look as if they have not looked for a week and their faces are greasy. I know that in the old West the boys were not always well-tuned, but to man this is a movie that makes you just go "EWWWW!" Indeed, this is crazy west. Denver Pyle also had to live this, especially after appearances in so many large Western countries. Bad, bad film.
