If I had a film thermometer, this movie would be absolutely zero. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> gathered one afternoon with a camera, made a plot, and shot a movie. It's so lacking in any artistic value that I'd rather watch kids walk around high school before watching this movie. However, something has to be said for the abysmal depths. "Staggering" in the staircase is one of the most popular humorous scenes in history. First and foremost, fighters simply wave plastic guns and pull their arms back and forth to simulate a backlash. A couple really "ducks" of non-existent bullets. No more sparks, no sparks, no blanks, just waves of sprayed syringes. If you want to see two grown men, play "an actor," once you do it ... after you have cleaned the fridge, scraped the carpet, scraped all the cranks, scraped the gravel, straightened the books on the shelf, etc.
