I bought this DVD without any previous link, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West, and Farrah Fawcett on his cover. I found the Brazilian title very strangely, but I decided I would wait to see a fun comedy, maybe as a "Switch". An unreasonable story is terrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) undergoes a sexist surgery in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood and says Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claims half of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). During the days of Myra and her alter-ego Myron, they destroyed a young couple in their uncle's shy academy. At some point, the confused scenario is so confused that I think the whole story was just a mental-induced accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welche and Farrah Fawcette is not enough to keep this movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman up to the point")
