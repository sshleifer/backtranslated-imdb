I like low budget independent movies and had great hopes for this one. But this movie is static. It does not matter the production value, which is very sophisticated for its budget, but speed is deadly. It is true that these people will reach a lot with little, but the film fails at the most basic level. It's boring. The cut is an iceberg and stimulation booths. It should be 65 minutes. Dr Hyde's best thing is Mr Hyde, which is not nearly enough to see. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we must suffer from the fact that the Baltimore-British are being thrown into endless and tiring exposures. It feels like a deep scene that plays on the video. Noble efforts all in production, but the story that this tired needs kick in trousers and funky new low cost technology should give a fresh voice. Instead, it's just a lame protector.
