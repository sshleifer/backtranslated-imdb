It was a disappointment that he had seen this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the unequal script. <br /> <br /> While some of them are funny and hip, it's quite dull, dysfunctional and lifeless. Many of the gags just sit there, lacking spark and energy. From the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch come well. Roger Herren plays the role of Rusty (he has done too badly for other movies). But because of my money, John Huston is too much, and poor Rex Reed is barely able to fight. His character seems relocated to collapse to the edge, wondering what he's doing in this movie. A low user rating should give an idea of ​​the public's perception of the work. Vidal's original provided many potential, which was largely unnecessary. Even the "classic" movie clips did not do so much. Overall, this is a somewhat unattainable effort and it is unlikely that it will be better suited over time.
