What does it mean? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays in the future a policeman who is associated with a talking dinosaur (!) for a criminal case involving a fool who wants to start another ice age. The spooky trait is embarrassing and ridiculous, a tall concept in search of oneself. It seems to be the work of love for the writer and director Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); sad, final results are anemic, charitable. Goldberg's mere presence on the screen can often cause good will and laughter, no matter how bad the scenario is, but here he drowns and you see unsuccessful results. NO STARS from ****
