Since Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was a little, I was curious about the sequel. Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated feature with the highest quality of everything, a score and focuses on the general audience. On the other hand, Little Mermaid 2 is aimed primarily at young children because it is spontaneous, reflects the child's own perspective, music is reflective and less dramatic and feels like a shot. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when the baby Melody is presented to Ariel's family. Suddenly without any visual stimulus to help drama, a huge tentacle is missing a child. I laughed, wait a moment that it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Okay, I'm not going to laugh. Morgan's crime in bright daylight and her spontaneity will take away the potential drama since it happened so quickly. Throughout the movie, Melody seems to be superhuman I am advocating, it's how most kids introduce themselves. This quality of Melody's character is clearly drawn to the end when he struggles with Morgana without centimeters of fear on his face. As the first film Melody has a lot of Ariel problems, except the opposite. Queen Ariel appears to be her father by limiting her from the ocean while King Triton cut Ariel off the surface. Ariel and Melody revolt against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music is more emotionally moving in the first. This sequel has plenty of songs, but not so much orchestral work went into it. It's great for young children because the orchestra does not take over the orchestra. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with the bouncing song and everyone plays in the water. It's definitely more child-oriented, because instead of ending serious and letting you blow up, this end lets you think, "It's time for a holiday!" This movie is ultimately fun for the kids and that's why we should have fun.
