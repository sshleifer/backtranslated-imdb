Wow ... what can I say ... First IMDb says it's at the end of the 1960s ... which means that Carlito would be very close to going to jail, stepped out in 75 and said it was for a while 5 years. They used a lot of actors and a story that did not make sense. He brings back only one actor, Guzman, and plays a completely different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican cat? Wheres Gale? He said he had loved her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You think he was in this. And if it makes sense, where are Rocco and black dude at first? It was all stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
