To see the mystery, do not watch it. Although there are elements directly from Elmore Leonard, it comes closer to the episode of "dynasty," because the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - that is, Long, boring conversations between silly and unrelated characters. Some people can do fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this. Avoid it, especially if you like actors who are involved in it.
