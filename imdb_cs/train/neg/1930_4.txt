Some praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least because you do not think of adults. This script suggests the beginning as a live-action movie that has hit someone as a type of stupidity that you can no longer sell to adults. "Crack staff" of many older adventure films has done well before (you mean _The Dirty Dozen_), but _Atlantis_ is one of the worst movies in this theme. The characters are weak. Even the background that every member looks like is at best the smallest. MD / Medical man, tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we had not seen them before, we saw laughter and combinations earlier. The story of how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci), went from the florist to the demolition completely unconvincing. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, the young obsessed with Atlantis, Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. Milo looks for Atlantis and continues his grandfather, who raised him. The opening scene is seen by a younger younger, who is keen on his knee while his grandfather puts on his pear helmet. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were at best thin, the best part about Atlantis was the voice talent. Perhaps Milo's depth is not stronger than the Fox spell. Commander Rourke loses nothing James Garner has said. Although Rourke is a fairly supplying military type, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into characters simply by delivering it. Garner's vocal performance is the pinnacle. I'm sorry that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is no more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two well-done, funny lines - but I always like Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. Animation background, that is. Animation of the character was not so bad for Disney from the minimalism that pushed Don Blu from the door. Animation of the character will do nothing unless it means flatter characters appear even more flat. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, it is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say they are bruised. I'm not so sure. Any service site can be done with a new appropriate procedure. Shakespeare often started from a well-known story and plot and was known only for painting new paint. So treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously lacks it. <br /> <br /> I can not get into all logical spaces without spoiler. The conspiracy was bad. The bridges of the plot are pressed like a yarn and the end is meaningless. To add to that, the script and the animation are peppered with annoying negligence. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> 1. At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that the runic or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly rewritten and the "CÃ´te d'Ivoire" should read "The Coast of Iceland ", we're starting to have problems. Scenario writers would need to know that the British accepted Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignored the older Latin term Hibernia. But more than they need to know about the conspirator Vikings to call a greener island in Iceland and Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making it a question of mis-tranliterated "letter", the writers have condemned to demand a rune version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Because it's been a long time since Atlantis was supposed to get into the underwater cave. And without visible traces and less technology than Milo made the inscription much less credible. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard's journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, or she would not know anything about a cave or a crystal lying "in the Royal Eye". It had to be written after the sinking, but without the technology Milo had on the expedition, how the hell did Leviathan do. So how could it be more about it? And why should it be written in the Atlantic? <br /> <br /> Auto-writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require shepard to write in Atlanta. So it must be some automatic writing. Because no one who has gone to Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of crystal clear news to the surface. That would make more sense. But it could also be explained in the film: Milo could find out that this power had told him all his life-appeared in dreams, etc. It was necessary to examine the film. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlanteans would simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to discuss in Europe before the Romans understood that the hard "c" or their day became French "ch" (pronounced as "sh", no less!) 4 The current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm - when they were obviously able to * read, but now they are unable to read what they used or operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Voice illiteracy points to a major flaw in the movie. It seems that this culture has not happened. It seems hanging up in the air until Milo can save it. Although life does not seem to be a lasting struggle for survival, nobody wants to compose poetry or write novels, and maybe it's a combination of Atlantean school systems that have come to an end and a lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kida can be justified for not knowing how to read or use the machine if she was so young when the Cataclysm of stupidity - But ANY OF IT ** HARDLY ** Qualifies her father for Deification! Kashakim's stupidity almost pulled his people out of existence. He killed a pile of disaster, blocked progress (he was not much killed here, but oversaw a massive slump in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill them unless they were first cooked in the lava because the giant robots were not there to protect them . <br /> <br /> The blue-green screw should shatter Kashakim's shape when Kid tried to combine the image of her father with the circle of THE GREAT Rabbits of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. While Milo was the only one who could read the Atlantean, Rourke and others knew so much that they were looking through the gibberish book and found a page on the crystal - which he knew was crystal and not some stylized astrological or "sun phase". <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about it, he still does not explain how Rourke suffered Milo's reading to be part of the book. She ripped the page that had been in Rourke's ears, even though Milo found no sign of a broken page in the book-apparently it was just for the audience to reflect that "something was wrong." If the word "Crystal" did not stop Milo in the head for someone to try to steal, Milo would have no doubt. It's just a rough preface. <br /> <br /> 8. The "double cross" of the crew was not a change of character. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey, and Cookie had started with Rourke from the beginning. However, "heart change" is decreasing. It was a change and it had to be better motivated. It's hard to do with characters who have nothing to do. <br /> <br /> 9. It seems that the lava flows through the dome instead of filling the rest of the area from which we were following the sequence. It's fluid; will not flow over the protective dome until it has filled all the lower surfaces. <br /> <br /> 10. Final STINKS! - and has no other meaning than to reassure political correctness. Because his power is restored, Atlantis is no longer the weak power that needs to be killed. Giant robotic guards and the sky that shoot with the blue light indicate that they are not afraid of us than they could. Technology is better than ours, and certainly at the beginning of the 20th century. Eventually Milo must teach Atlantians to read why? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, punished culture alone, not to send it to hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> The faults I find with the film agree with this idea. But I'm on the loose, why should I pay to see thin figures and make holes simply because many decades of novels also had it. And stories from pulp are part of the "bullshit that can no longer be sold by adults". We've become a little more sophisticated and our fiber has to grow. Raiders of the Lost Ark have lost no sense of pulp and have avoided so many mistakes. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 - The movie is nice, but as I think about the plot, it's getting smaller.
