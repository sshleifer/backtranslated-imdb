This is the worst movie I've ever paid, and save 'save Hitler's brain', the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV, so I was expecting what I thought was the most funny movie that could be produced because it had no limitations that television improvisation has to deal with. Writers had to think we were throwing some roughness, some jokes of flattery, some cheap sex, and hey, we have a risky side that divides the mix comedy. Game show skits are nothing but cheap unimaginable take-offs at Let's Make Deal with a rough stupidity. The sitting com took off when one girl and her girlfriend was just a bad high school. Stun gun advertising was good for Seasame Street. There was a pleasant humor of hopeless blood around the LA underground. The French chef, who goes after the blind, is constantly saying that "there is no difference" with the French accent, I was fine. I thought the only funny sketch was about Chevy Chase, which lasted for a full minute. This means you get 60 seconds of fun in this movie. Oh, yes, I have read comments on the whole country that was stoned in the 70s, and you will enjoy this movie if you're tall. Most countries were not stoned in the 1970s. If stubborn writers were stoned, it had to be a sleepy cavity. There were four other people in the theater beside me when I saw this movie. Of course, the word did not yet comment on how bad the film was.
