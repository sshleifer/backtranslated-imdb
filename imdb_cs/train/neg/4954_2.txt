I was brought up watching the original Batman animated series, and I'm excited about the Batman graphic novel collector. With comics as an icon like Batman, there are certain features that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are good and good, but when it changes character, it is too far away. I bought one of the seasons "The Batman" in the hope that another bonus element could slightly illuminate the creators' thoughts of showing it as such atrocities. In an interview with The Batman, one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure who) said that "we felt we should not be afraid of Batman, but we might be wrong with the villains." So they went on to get Joker into an immature little child who begs for attention, Penguin into an anime knockoff, Mr Freeze into a super-driven jewelery thief, Poison Ivy into a teenage hippie, and countless other shameful acts that Bob Kane is doing tomb. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I wish I had more hands to bring this show to the FOUR. It converts with your rating with 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the name Batman. Warner Bros. ... reevaluate this! Please!
