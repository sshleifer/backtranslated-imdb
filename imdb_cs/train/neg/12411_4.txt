In the 1970s, many really great horror films have been produced - but this film is definitely not one of them! It's a shame The baby is no better because it works from a decent idea that takes a couple of successful horror motifs. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child that worked so well in classical movies like The Bad Seed, and then we have a central theme of zombies, which, of course, was the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically the following: a young girl accuses the burden of people because of her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to avenge (like you). That's all good and good, except the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens to most of the movie, and although it finally highlights some pretty gore; it is not enough to justify sitting over the rest. The movie was clearly shot in the budget because the places look cheap and all actors are garbage. I can not say much about the movie because it's not too much. The baby is a terrible seizure of the 1970s, and I definitely do not recommend it.
