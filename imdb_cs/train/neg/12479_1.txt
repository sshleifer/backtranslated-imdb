DEATHSTALKER is ideal for fans of B-fantasy films; this barely 80 minute movie trailer all hecklers can ask for - no rendering, horrible acting (except at least malicious old ladies), funny scripting and editing slogans and bargaining basement settings. There are no characters that may look like sympathetic or interesting (mainly they do not say anything about it) and the actors have barely gathered anything that would rise above the F-grade material. If that's not enough, then how is the lack of a convincing plot (which does not have this film) to make DEATHSTALKER a major turkey? I was also offended that women in this movie barely serve a different purpose than to 1) be topless and / or almost dressed; 2) are raped; 3) sex with the hero; 4) all above. In addition, background music is hideous; bizarre disorder of electronic noise, cheese choral explosions and crazy orchestral cacophony. With constant ears and eye strain that are all right, and no one cares, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for people looking for something to laugh (and believe me, there is plenty). Otherwise, I do not recommend that this 100-degree CONAN want to be the smallest.
