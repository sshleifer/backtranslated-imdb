so ... it's really sexist and classicist, and I thought it might not be in the beginning of the movie as if Stella had said she really wanted to change and she started talking the right way and he says not to change. Well, he definitely changed his melody and the other reviewers seemed to follow. what at first seems to be a love story is really about social status and about women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero, it makes it all sad. and it's sad that people think he's making it a hero. maybe it's a commentary on a movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects the constant patriarchal currents in the social conscience. fuj.
