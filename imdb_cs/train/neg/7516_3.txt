I rented it, so shoot me! A decent assumption sets another unpleasant story without a real payout, but at least it's good. Director Jon Keeyes has a simple idea of ​​a fake spooky house with real dangers inside. In most cases it should be a slam dunk, but this little odor derails relatively quickly. Cinematography is above average and acting is at best media, but the story and writing are just terrible. Slower scenes drag forever, and fears are too few and far between, without the real culmination of the movie. An exhilarating mood is set at the beginning but it loses shine before some sort of horror appears and I was bored to death and put another sandwich ... Art packaging is tempting and I suppose it is worth the rent if you are looking for a soulless low budget , but if you like a good story and an experimental end, talk to something else.
