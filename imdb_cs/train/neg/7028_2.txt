Somewhere between Food Court and Zip, the store in this movie has a store of explosives. This is the only place where the title character can buy a bomb that grew in a shopping mall in a boring finale. The sad city has a new shopping mall, built on some land. <br /> <br /> It was condemned. Cute Girl (I did not find my name) gets work as a waitress there. She lost her boyfriend in the fire at the place where the square stands. A tiny owner hires a fraudster responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security guard is dead. Rob Estes, formerly "Silk Stalkings," is a photographer / reporter trying to find a story. He associates with Cute Girl and their mutual "funny" friend, Paula Shore, and tries to find out if Eric is still alive. He is living in the basement in a shop (?) And traveling through the air ducts and going through various people who upset his ex-girlfriend, including the arsonist. Eventually it takes off <br /> <br /> and the final includes the bomb and all runs from the scene in front of the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is on his way to being a mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course you probably did not need a sketch, <br /> <br /> The story is in the name. Someone named Eric took revenge on people as a shopping mall. This also means there is no tension. We know that Eric is behind it, but we still have to see that Estes and the cute girl go through a stupid investigation. Watch Fairchild, who we know in cafeterias with the owner of the shopping mall all the time, pulling a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of the hill, but no one says the word because it leads to her office and her potential death. The fictional city is huge, but the nary policeman is sometimes called, everyone relies on the security center to order. Eric has been hiding since the store was built, but I'm not sure where. He seems to be living in the basement, but you think a construction worker would find him. He is also well-equipped with his love and found several stores because he has electricity. It can be nicer than your apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both of you, note. Catch the security guard <br /> <br /> from the stand by making a monthly camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, that's where you get to the black and white shot of Pauly's South Coast,> <br /> It's just junk and proof positive that I'm just to rent just what will remain in the video store in the horror section. This film is not Eric's revenge, it's a film avenger for being stupid enough to watch him. Here's my revenge: I do not recommend it. This will be shown on it! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, some gun violence, gore, some shamefulness, some nudity, short male nudity, and some sexual content.
