It is hard to imagine anyone might consider this short of their favorite if they saw most of their shorts, but I know humor is very subjective. I saw all of their sound shorts (far from the best of their IMO stuff) and found one of their weaker efforts. In the year it was made (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature. They were immensely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of his continued work. In addition, it was a time of experimentation for writers and Stan. I think it was an experiment that did not really work. As someone else said, it does not play on its strengths. Too much dialogue and conspiracy. The best part of this for me is the mostly improvised succession with Stan as Agnes' maid and the great Thelma Todd, who talks about "girl" things. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see boys in their most creative and funny look at Blotto, or Brats from the same year. They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think she can be forgiven for having a few less than a pair of shorts. They made a total of 108 films. Very few (except those made on FOX) were completely failures, but there are some. Regional Hospital, Me and my pal, Live Ghost, Fixer Upper come to mind as basically weak. But other than those who find something gorgeous in all their shorts. My existing record in my book. If you saw and enjoyed all of your other shorts, then it should check everything, but I would be willing to bet that this was less unforgettable for Stan and Babe.
