Johnny Dangerous's second film, Amy Heckerling, is a parody of 1930s gangster films created in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays as a middle-aged gangster who looks back on his heavy knock when he catches a kid who is about to steal some of his guitar business in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) still has health problems, so Keaton falls into an early age crime through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile falegant Richard Dimitri plays an opponent with Boyle and Keaton. Joe Piscopo has a cheerful turn like Danny Vermin, yeah, that's true, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother, who became a district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor's wife and Marilla Henner plays Keaton's minor. The film looks notoriously cheap, so it seems like a TV show instead of a theatrical film. The movie starts out well and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Because of the combination of dialogue and gag, the films are held in the first half, but then they quickly lose their pair and in the second half they descend into mediocrity and vulgarity. Keaton chews the landscape that makes James Cagney's best look. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just unpleasant, not funny. Piscopo once "once" bites too much. Several supporting actors are trying to withstand a fortress like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. like a table, and Sudie Bond as a ruthless cleaning lady. The other half develops in a hit or loses the tone of a TV show and never recovers. The final scene using The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism such as the movie Call of the Wild Clark Gable, which appeared in the movie earlier in the movie. I think Heckerling was supposed to know better because the target audience would certainly be aware of the date of 19th * 1/2 from 4 stars.
