Stephen Feinberg, who played a proctor and was one of the film's authors, died at the beginning of 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, that was the year he told me he was a Hollywood writer earlier, working mostly on TV promos . He asked me not to see Tunnel Vision, but it was too late, I saw it! I actually saw it years ago when he was released. At that time I did not think it was such a bad movie. When I saw it as an adult, my opinion was a bit different. Yes, he is a little crazy, just like a dated. Steve admitted it was not a good movie. It said he was a bit proud of the sketch of the "Proctologist".
