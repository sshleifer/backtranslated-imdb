In accordance with Disney's acknowledged Theft Practice .. I mean .. buy known properties and bastard them, this live-action version of the venerable classic caricature must be one of the worst re-doing in a bad re-doing. I grew up on the original series of TV series. Each episode of the original cartoon series gives you more laughter than this whole movie. Not available Penny's cool computer book. There is no gag with self-destructive orders, which always end with a burglary. The new ones are a smooth-talking Gadget Convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and a feature of the typical, unrealistic romance in Hollywood. Do not forget to check out the paymasters to pay Disney executives and even their executives - you will not see this movie. <br /> <br />
