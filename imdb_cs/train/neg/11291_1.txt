Sheesh! What a terrible movie. Sufficient camera work, a scenario with more maize than Kellogg, and behavior so greedy that you could open a pig farm with him. <br /> <br /> If you want to conceal everything, do not know which audience to focus on - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - Get into a soapbox about the dangers of smoking whenever someone lights a cigarette, dear, darling, and in another unpleasant scene we have baddie, Lobo, forcing his, and, if you want, striptease dressed in bikini. Try to explain that one to the kids ... <br /> <br /> Throw in too distorted Treasure Island-cum-Jaws type dej, and the result is the movie so unintentionally funny, it's nice - I should not expect DVD Special Edition whenever.
