I agree with all that people have said about this, but I have to say that the soundtrack is probably the best I've ever heard of my life! There are real vocals at the time you were supposed to listen to the actresses talking! And the vocals are like a broad version of the Danzig singing: "The darkness of the woods, the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something so unenviable. The singer has a horrible vibrato and was recorded with a microphone with a height range over some combined string and fake drum drums. That's horrible!! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male leads are terrible. So are women. This is one bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say turns around being a man or a woman, just playing stereotypes to the maximum. It makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> Children were so distant in their lines, you could not understand them. And why do girls always wear in her hair a cute bow, a nice blue dress and long hair? And spiritual boys always wear clean cut pants with cute little shiny blond hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Your face was too impeccable and clean as a man living in a cave. Nice beards and bangs, pa. Did you perfectly cut those with the knife yourself, or did you go to the city and go to the salon? Stupid movie.
