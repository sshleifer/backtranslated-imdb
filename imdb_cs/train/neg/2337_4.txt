I do not know what a humbuck is around ... This is really a bad movie ... he did not do me anymore, the only scene of the descent is where everyone gathered at the party, playing a nice song, rising rhythm and nice movie footage that made you motion ... it was the best part of the film ... Otherwise, this film lacks the best to revive the viewer. There is no story, there is nothing to think, as some people say, there is no coherence between different stories ... it was rather an attempt to reconstruct Anderson's "Magnolia", which was great, but inadvertently fails ... Well, it's light and easy to follow, but they are also mosaics. Maybe you first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
