People who praise this film are a real disappointment - I hope at least Leonard will see some good $$ of it because his life savings have been misappropriated by the manager a few years ago and now he's over 70. But this movie is just terrible. In the beginning, Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then, in another hour and a half, he emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so bloody DRAHÃ‰ with its infinite detail over the emoting singers. Cohen's interview is happening in a lo-fi video and so I wanted to see medium or long shots of the whole body! I could not care less about the comments of the artists, especially the exaggerated ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this movie made even one song as good as Leonard's own music, and if you think you see and have doubts, pay attention to them. It would be acceptable for a special PBS, maybe to show it once. But I'll even hesitate when I get a DVD about it. When the film finally shows Leonard's "Tower of Song", it is destroyed by Bono, who has poetry. Even occasional good performances (Anthony, Ruf's first number, Martha's traitor) are broken by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla. Forget about this and go buy Leonard's latest album if you want to take it.
