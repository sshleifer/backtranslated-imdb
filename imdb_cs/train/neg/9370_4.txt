Although this is not a "great movie", there is something convincing and memorable. Just like another movie commentator, I saw it in childhood. It's thirty-three years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its absurdly cumbersome title. See if you have an opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of a small urban life as it develops over the decades. More than any other film brings the human face to the historical drama of "progress" from the beginning of the twentieth century. It is sufficiently interested for the young spectator and is sufficiently memorable for the elderly. In addition, it is easy to enjoy the characters and watch their passage through time.
