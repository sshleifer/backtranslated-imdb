A group of extremely impudent A holes is poisoned by the fray puppets that some older night watchkeepers keep in prison for twenty years for no reason. Many people know this film only from the place where the MST3K moved in place. But I saw a real movie and I can safely say yes, it's bad, really, really bad. One of the worst "combat" scenes I've ever witnessed was filled with extraterrestrial toys that suffer from a lack of movement (I had the creepy My Monster that was scary) to the horrific My Monster Monster acting, which was much more charismatic). , it was said that movies by Rick Sloan "Vice Academy" are in some way, and believe me that I have no terrestrial idea as, much worse. This does not mean that this movie is anything but that it is not. Just get out there. <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: No nudity in your own movie but there are 2 pairs of breasts on DVD Introduction to My Grade: D- Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction Jim Wynorski; Image gallery; and Trailer for this movie
