Although the movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, let's skip this. I watched it on TV, so I did not have to pay the money for it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are rather believable, it is becoming more and more incredible. It is very doubtful if an experienced soldier, like Lieutenant Waters, did not obey direct orders. And even if it were, if the rest of his platoon. They know they are exposed to direct danger, and they know they will die if they follow, but what the hell is our lieutenant, so we do what he says (by direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They a little save the village, where the whole population is massacred by the rebels. Well, a dozen villagers are saving, the rest has been killed. A strange part of having taken the trucks the insurgents left behind. They prefer to walk. Maybe because the roads are not dangerous, but there was no explanation. Anyway. I think he got this movie as the only point I gave him. What made this film insulting the brain, so it's absolutely unbelievable that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being injured or killed. They only lose a couple of friends at the end. And that's just because they have to fight the army almost 500 or more. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> Fighting so many armies, killing hundreds and getting rid of themselves. And they have wheels and round bullets. You will never get there. Grenades and mines, M60 machine guns, and even RPGs. Where they get these things. Transferring or what? They even got a notebook that shows them the activity of hostile rebels. And this notebook has a battery that lasts for a few days. Really? Who thinks this bullshit. <br /> <br /> I think if you completely shut your brain and accept that the rebels are a lot of idiots, you will give this movie a high rating. If it is not, skip this one. It saves you time.
