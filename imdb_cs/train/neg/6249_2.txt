(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is one good thing about this poor Pokémon (what you do): the introductory topic. It must be the most beautiful thematic music from any eager name of Japanese anime television shows for Japanese brand makers - for-the-oops-i-mean-the-young-fans. Unfortunately, there was a need to add some kind of show to the theme. And they just could not come up with something more interesting than people who were hard-witted about which cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can not imagine why the kids wanted to sit in a show, where the dialogue that wrote a thousand monkeys in five minutes occupies 98% of the run. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastic Compassion for the awesome Ultimate Doom duel will have your mad pyramid diamond beast in one stroke! Can not you see that you have no chance to win this battle, you crazy?" HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! "<br /> <br />" Oh yeah? Take a good look at it! I'm going to use my destructive power Delta Times Pie Card that will eradicate every single of your Power Munchers and make your Uber-Fantastic Faithful Creation Day Ultimate Doom Destroy For All Significance Attack Needless! you bet you did not see one coming! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Yu-Gi-Oh" is only in the silent words of Roger Ebert's reviews of Clockwork Orange, "smooth and boring." Not to mention that I have been bitten for a long time (I realize that I have hypocrisy with regard to I do not know if there is any plot and static monsters do not have the character of Pokémon Even if I do not compare my favorite caricature as a child this show is upset It's unintentionally funny, but it's not fun enough that it's worth seeing. Good-bye, we sleep, we're dreaming of wet dreams.
