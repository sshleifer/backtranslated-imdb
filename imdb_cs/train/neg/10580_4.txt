I saw it last week after I lifted the DVD cheap. I wanted to see it for ages when I found contours of the plot very interesting. So my disappointment was great, at least what to say. I thought the main actor was very flat. This type of performance required performance like Johnny Depp in the Ninth Gate (which is almost total discouragement), but I think television budgets do not always touch on this kind of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the direction was puzzled and boring, just to remind that Carpenter did not make a decent film because in the mouth of madness. As for the story - I was also disappointed! There was no way he could meet my expectations, I think, but I thought the payouts and explanations were bad, and the way he eventually got the counter-climatic film to say at least. one of the main contributors to AICN, and you can say he loves his cinema, but I would like to get a better result from such a good initial assumption. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
