What a waste of time! I tried to sit on "Sky Captain .." about 6 times, and every time, in about three minutes, I'll do something else - anything else! It's a really boring movie, it's horrible, writing is dull, and it's probably the first time the director because it's stiff and I wanted to love him. I like science fiction, old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the nod of Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my god that I worked for Paramount Pictures and I wrote to Sherry Lansing in 1993 that I used a blue screen for tests on the screen and told me that it will never have any interest, or it is necessary, 10 years later, Paramount Publishing Sherry was right in 1993, but she had to forget her own advice when she enlarged this dog. The blue screen effect shot , but not the whole movie Do not even notice that neither Jude nor Jolie are amazing actors in the eyes.) Paltrow's performance reminds me of high school work - it's bad - it could work ed, but only under a qualified director. The funny thing is that director Sky Captain will continue to work. It's a business, not an art!
