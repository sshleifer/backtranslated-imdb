The end of violence and, of course, the Million Dollar Hotel implied that Wenders had lost his vision, his ability to tell convincing stories through a moving image map. Land of Plenty, I'm afraid, seals the coffin by being an immensely non-imaginative, of course, sentimental and cliche film. Characters are quite flat and stereotyped, writing, plotting and direction are amateur, at best. For the first time for a while, I was impatient to finish the film so I could continue my life. The war-torn delirium of my uncle, a patriotic abstract view of the sky at the end ... it all seemed to me just as simple and poor as hardly the work of a filmmaker who had once shot a surprise magic on the screen. What happened? Experiment days, sensitive writing and interesting shooting options have been a long time behind, I'm afraid. Let's hope he finds inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival where I saw the film, Wenders was there to introduce him. The lack of humility offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you are looking forward to the next two hours." I'm afraid he can not be wrong ...
