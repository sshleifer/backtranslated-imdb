An unforgettable line from a short show. After reviewing the episode where this line was introduced, my brother's intramural flag football team started using the line to break our musicians into a misdemeanor. Instead of the Ready / Break report, our quarterback said that FOTBAL and the rest of the team answered BET! It's a fun way to break the noise that our opponents scratched their heads because few of them watched the show. Using this line has added to our season a unique feature I will never forget. We had our best season during my time at college that year and in a small way it was fun because we used this line. The show was largely stingy, but she lives in memories of the 1977 Kappa Phi football division in West Virginia Tech.
