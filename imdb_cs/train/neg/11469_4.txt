ORCA is not bad, but it's not really Richard Harris's lesson. As a demented fisherman who resembles Ahab, Harris gets into a death game with a revenge killer whale after killing a "woman" of a whale and an unborn child. Charlotte Rampling is a whale expert who joins Harris. He screams a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He will not listen and eventually end up in arctic combat with revenge. There are no special effects to speak, except what looks like a round mirror for the whale's eye - there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye, so the viewers understand that the whale knows who it is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris' crews, has a particularly unpleasant escape with an orc, and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridin, Will Sampson, and Keenan Wynn, are not much in common.
