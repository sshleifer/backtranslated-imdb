It was not so great. It's not horrible or hateful or anything, just forgotten. It was sort of, hesitant, diluted air, as if it had never known if he wanted to go laugh or for sweetness or satire. So we stayed with a weak combination of three. The actors looked a little lost. Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified. How many times do we have to say that 50 years in states have been infected with a banal sense of consensus? And that it became an aggressive consumption? And that emotional repression in men is a matter of baaaaad? Old hat. But his biggest crime in my eyes was separate from reality. I know it was comedy and everything, but - especially in a full movie where you have to keep an audience of interest for a long time - you still need some emotional anchor, a relative story guide,. For a "hero" kid who looks at an old woman, two college student and finally his father dying painfully in the hands of a zombie or whatever, and to greet them with a cheerful smile and shrug of my shoulders, then I'm just trying to deal with it in some positive way. My mom was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman at this level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened. The biggest positive thing I can offer is that I love the look of this kind of apple cake in the suburbs, and that has captured it so well, it was a nice film, especially some of those wide streaks of the street and inside the Robinsons house. Also, the tower was cute, and it was funny. And I thought Billy Connolly was all right, and it's coming from someone who's not a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I was just afraid that he would be crazy and try to steal every scene, but he played pretty little for him and probably came out with the most appealing character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Everybody in all is not great.
