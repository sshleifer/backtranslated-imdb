A lot of women who can not act sit, talk, smoke pots. They have another woman in a wheelchair who is hiding because it is distorted and sometimes kills someone who feeds that person a human body that really looks like some ham they bought and dressed in several plastic fingers. We do not see anyone killing, suddenly there is a body covered with blood on the floor. I can not eat the lid on the sheet anymore. Just the idea of ​​covering the spam on the sheet is enough to bring about the same narcoleptic mood that has appeared in trying to go through the whole movie. Sometimes scenes of a fellow who is "hunted" by the torture of a fellow who is attached to the chair's basement are accidentally inserted. Why he caught him and how he was connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are scenes from some "superhuman" guy out there. It's blood and wall strikes, but who is or is wrong with it is neither explained nor even tied to the story. There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to watch boring people, you talk deeply about nothing when you sit and eat ham and smoke, then there are 90 minutes, because except the scene in which one chick hooks on the street and said random scene, absolutely NEVER happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot to see how things move, including a deformed sister when they move to their new apartment. One of the few when sitting on the couch or lying in bed.
