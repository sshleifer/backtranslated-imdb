Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-created the script for Aronofsky. This film succeeded at every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of personal lives and the bad habits that destroyed them. "The last trip to Brooklyn" still has a bad habits and many characters who live a sad life, but hardly the same righteousness that Aronofsky did. The film seems gay at times. Especially when homosexuality is equal to death in the film. One homosexual character is stoned, run in the sky by a speedy car and dead on a pavement. Another is crucified and even more is simply beaten. Another exaggerated shock value, which could be really appealing if it did well, are the scenes of unionists who literally fight with the attackers. Who would have thought the drama about Brooklyners would contain action sequences and truck explosions? Director Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a television director but is far below the cut for true movies. The film is clumsy without seeming to settle on the genre. The lake has an unnecessary role to fill a mannequin, and Baldwin just seems to know how to look silly in his equally lean part. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh comes as our leadership, a naughty shooter named Tralala (believe it or not, I can not joke). Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is the least dirty. Bad use of color and composition makes it cheaper than it, and also the "real" edge of more provocative bits. Failure.
