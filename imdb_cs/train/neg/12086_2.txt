... this veron does not show Bard so badly. Still, it is a terrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is inexplicably called the Spaniard (whether it is Ricardo Montalban or not, is the subject of debate), and Maximilian Schell exaggerate as never before. Most of the dialogue is convinced that the version of MST3K feels compelled to repeatedly draw attention to the fact that the speeches are long * duh * does not find me incredibly funny. Mostly it's just a bad deal.
