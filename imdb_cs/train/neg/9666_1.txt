When they saw the "Triumph of Will", I can only say that this film is haunted, even measured against the historically low "standards" of the time. Naturally, everything is completely made and harmful. This is what can be expected from German propaganda in 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation is in itself useless and inexpensive. It's so obviously absurd that even the current Germans had to leave the theater and hold their noses. In a genre renowned for its basic attractions, lack of originality, and the recklessness of a bad head, this film does not even seem to be "bad". This would have greatly improved the achievement of this state!
