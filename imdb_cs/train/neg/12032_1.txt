This movie was terrible. I had a very hard time tracking it all the way. I did not understand the movie. What was the reason for this film? The soundtrack was bad, it was bad and the story was unsuccessful. The two main characters in the film were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among some of the cast members. I do not know about that, but I think most actors were the first timers. The movie could simply be reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This shows how many unnecessary scenes were in the movie. I'd rather have a root channel within two hours of the movie. I want you two hours back! If you want to watch a good, fun family-friendly movie made with a lot of Mormons, check out the Napoleon Dynamite site.
