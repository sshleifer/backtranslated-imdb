Utter strike. I got to 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. If possible, I would give him a negative numeric rating (though the "bad" word is more appropriate ...). Unlike what you've seen and practically felt between MacMurrer and Stanwyck in the original, chemistry between stupid Dicky Crenna and what her face there is just does not exist. Anklet becomes an unimportant bracelet? Is there no fingertip cigarette light? And I thought I would be sick when they had Lee J. Cobb, who has a humbled look (and I really do believe that) when Keyes walks out and explains his "little man" to Mr. Garloupis. No violation invisible, but it looks as if the blind men got together with the set design of Dietrichson and Neff's. The same goes for the terrible trousers that Phyllis wore. And cricket, how much $ $$ does Neff live, overlooking a huge harbor? This, folks, is all over again in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you do more, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist. But please, first take some Alka-Seltzer, or you will develop your own "little man" that will never disappear. Proceed with caution, of course.
