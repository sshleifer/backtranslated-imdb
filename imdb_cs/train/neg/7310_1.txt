** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever has a nod for the hardest film of the year ... that I saw it. This movie is Straight GARBAGE! It's so bad with a movie that you can not help but a surprise how bad it is. This movie had so many possibilities to be good, but in the end it did not do anything. The characters were as stupid as possible; For the whole movie, just ask yourself "why would you do that?" or "what is your opinion about it?" ... it's so illogical and silly figures. We do not get any background, so naturally you really do not give rats as their fate ... you can just laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The "bitch" (Marcy) ... was so excited to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? It did not make sense ... it is almost as if the creators needed an excuse to give her the virus so much! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would someone really want to go to the woods and drink the tap water without looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why did Bert just shoot the sick from the start? The movie would be like that ... except, eventually, they finally killed him. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to Walk? "No, I'll just wait until two infected my friends (one disappear from death) to finally decide to leave." - What exactly was the reason from the hermit's body just to fall into a contaminated tank and I get infected with a virus ... I hope, common sense is not a friend, much less the water supply of these idiots, I think it was not the worse end of the movie at the beginning, the kids ask the merchant of the store house for what the rifle was, and he replied In the end of the film, three young black men (dressed in bags, one in a jug) are going to the store to find out that the treasurer has cleaned it for use for hunting, and then goes on to give them all the pounds hands and joking with them as if they were his homeboys Well, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?!?!?!? How careless can it be, what filmmakers thought it was in the movie? I as a black man was, of course, offended by the initial remark "Nigg er "It was a tasteless, insignificant remark My question to the filmmaker: What was the end with the black kids? Should I have to forgive myself to forget the initial racist commentary? If you want to sort things out with black audiences, by doing the joke? Well, for one I did not find the sad humorous humorous attempt in the least. The whole movie was a joke ... A PATHETIC filming attempt that should not get time. Did Peter Jackson really think this movie is so good? What movie did he look at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * from **** star .... if I could give a lower score, I would. Please, colleagues IMDb'ers, do not spend 1Â½ hours of your precious life watching this abominable "film." This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
