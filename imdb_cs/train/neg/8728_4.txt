It is bad. A really bad and boring crime film that has nothing extraordinary about it. A lot of crimes, a killer you can not see throughout the movie, a classic investigation. And a classic story about a policeman who discovers what's going on and nobody believes, and he has to fight to reveal the truth. Not much in this. Vote: 4 out of 10.
