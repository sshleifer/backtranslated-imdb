They point to something out of the net. It is bad. While it's not as bad as B-movies they point to the sci-fi network on Saturday, but still a fairly large pile of bullshit. Action is satisfactory. Plot and writing are rather inadequate and the stimulation is quite slow. Every minute of the movie feels like part of the film where they pack things in front of credits - not the top of the film, the denomination. Also, large parts of the cast seem to be old for the age limit they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and worthy of watching. Save time. It does not even cost it to be free.
