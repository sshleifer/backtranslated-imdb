With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the movie, you think this will not be missed. But what can I say? It was a terrible wreck. The film is about Peter Sellers as an elderly master who suddenly found himself in a relationship with a really weird young man, not to mention the attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly unrelated and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very entertaining people, but this movie does not. <br /> <br /> The song about "Arabella Cinderella" is pretty cool, but that's it. I recommend this film only to people who like to watch extreme news, it is almost the definition of one. I think this film more than anything else is a sign of the time when it comes to certain experimentalism and everywhere around unconventionality, the problem is that quality is completely shot and writing, not to mention direction, is just out there. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers is particularly hit and missed by Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, on silly movies like this and the Christian Magic, which was very similar to this in context and style, but this film had several fun moments. This is nonsensical and I'm sad that in this movie someone was as good as Peter Sellers. Not recommended to anyone.
