An amazingly predictable stupid show about a man who killed his wife by stitching her while she was driving and claiming to have been lost. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car that killed his wife with one? The writers did not think so. The story then mentions the psychologist and his failed marriage, which is associated with the failed wife marriage killing the driver's blackout. All-helping mother and one dimensional baby are rated on a good scale and are all set to predictable detection and final crash. Are police psychologists so readily accepted? Still writing that the actors do the best, but they are doomed to failure. It's on the same level as Harlequin Romance. Do not waste your time by watching this if it's not what you're trying to do.
