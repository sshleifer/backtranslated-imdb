when you get into scenes that include Albert Brooks without a shirt ... try not to gag on the fur ball. I like Albert Brooks. I've seen most, if not all of his films, but he first saw it. Modern Romance is an interesting shot on the theme of love. There are a few films that deal with desperation of love, or just like modern Romance, although the 1979 Chilly Winter scene comes very close. They both deal essentially with obsessed men who are too attracted to their wives. Where-how Chilly Scenes of Winter is bordering on stalking, this movie has more grounded ground with a subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and beyond the relationship ... and again in that. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie that was released in 1981, it's his time in style and the like. That's the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule for movies is "If it's upsetting, at least it may have some historical significance," you know how it works in a time capsule. Which leads me to the terrible scenes of Alberto Brooks' famous T-shirt. <br /> <br /> The man has his hair. Big hair. Like he's wearing a black curly fur sweater - furry. What's worse is that it almost looks like the victim is burning - hairy. It's not a nice look and scenes with him without a shirt on and on. In the early eighties, hairy men were seen as normal and not shocking. But in 2009, there is something similar that it is simply rebellious. I'm sorry, Albert! I wish someone ever said, "Hey, let's try this scene, but with you a simple shirt, I think you might scare people." It's really bad, and I'm sorry for the poor, pretty actress who had to deal with Albert Brooks's naked body. Probably, after a few days, she drew the teeth of her hair. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's OK. It could be better if I did not see Alberto Brooks without a shirt for what seemed like ten long minutes, because it will forever comment on my viewing this movie.
