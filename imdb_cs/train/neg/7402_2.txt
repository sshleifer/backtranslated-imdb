This is a typical example of technically highly qualified video / ad director who tries to make his first feature film. On the one hand, the images, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a really "expensive" look and feel. Even the actors have some potential - to the extent that even the best actor could not hide the wrong plot. In this case, it's not a bad plot, but it's not at all a thing. </ br>> So 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?". In no case will any of the characters or audiences receive the slightest hint of response. In most other dialogues, one gets the feeling that there has never been any form of dialogue books, and actors have to freely improvise on a plot that has never been explained to them. The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance might be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow her to give her the tragically horrible conversations the other actors had to deal with. In this way she was able to show her acting talent, which could not even get the rest of the cast. I mean, the world is not the only actor to balance such a dialogue: Ben: Is that real, is not it? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone has to take over this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. No, no one, no one. Emily: Not from you. Ben: No <br /> <br /> I got a goose. But not for horror, more for a terrible attempt. At some point, I was ashamed of the actors adding it to my life. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
