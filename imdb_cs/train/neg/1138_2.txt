This was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt I needed to stop it, but unfortunately I experienced it, and it was a bit embarrassed by the poor movie. It's alright. if you are o.k. with raw moral drawings, and does not mind looking at a movie that generously disparages Whitman. If you want a fictional plot to appear on it.
