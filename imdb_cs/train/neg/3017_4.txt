Now I had the best intentions when I was following this. I like some work from Tony Scott, but my friend told me it's a great movie even though I heard something from other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott tried too hard. Everything was too much. Allow me to work it out. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley survived and was not good. The people who played well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time simply could not save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes that popped up in their originality but somehow seemed to be written by someone other than the main writer. A certain melody was used about four times, which really started missing after the second. I firmly believe that it does not use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> Also, editing really came out because the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repeating echo of some of Keire's lines simply sounded after hearing the second, third, fourth, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my point is that if you want to see an action flick that is very fast and "somewhat" entertaining and does not matter what I mentioned above, you may like it. <br /> <br /> (For the side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
