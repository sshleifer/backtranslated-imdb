Always enjoy great movies that deal with the super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. But this film just turned me away in terms of its production and direction. There is nothing that could lead to a profound debate about what this story must say; just say it was a great waste of time and effort to make it big on the screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, have performed excellent performance in their home country of England and we have seen him in the TV series "Still Standing". Heath Ledger, played a real evil guy, and we have seen him recently in "Brokeback Mountain", "05, gave a great support role." Shannyn Sossaman, Mara Sinclair, did a good job of seducting a church priest who was not recognized by any faith. , you apologize!
