If you hit the head with a shovel, write the scenario with your feet, you can approach the intelligence level of this movie. There's nothing in this movie that would have been done thousands of times with other gangster movies and would be much better. Those who think "Scarface" is a hero to look at "Goodfellas," "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents," and think MMM "It's Life for Me!" this movie will be enjoyed. I thought I would give the film a chance, because the premise was perfect for the predecessor. I should have known better when I looked at Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs. Anyone above Class 4 education, see the original with Pacin, a real actor and be satisfied.
