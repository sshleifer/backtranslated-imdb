Several farmers are fighting in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in major roles, speak with fake accents and emphasize old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good woman, many children and countries are the best for men. They are considered to be assets and investments. Since it is a large budget with lots of accessories, large sets and special effects, movie makers can not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won the Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her unchangeable face forms a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is to be the heart of the family and the best character. Paul Muni, on the other hand, is performing better and shows his talents again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems Franklin did not know when to end the picture. This movie could be dangerous if it is considered a real example of Chinese culture and traditions.
