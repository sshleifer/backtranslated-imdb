* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critique of media obsession with violence. This claim, however, ignores the real content of the film. Oliver Stone could show his serial killers as ominous, inhuman killers of innocent people and contrasted with the morbid media fascination. Instead, he lends them a justification. The film shows almost every victim as someone who deserves to be hurt. By engaging in malevolent stereotypes, Stone's victims are like uncomfortable cartoons - silly wrinkles, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The only person that the murderous nest is also a stereotype. Of course, they love the old, hallucinogenic American-Indian, because they're fashionable, buddy? We make him an admirable figure. Thick, Chinese officials and "hicks" are unstoppable, so it seems as if they deserve to die. Instead of twisted, hateful ones that are damaged by their bad deeds, their fury makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and surrealistic visuals are forced to attract more sensitive people. Justice is ridiculing. Police and prison officials are depicted as brutal, ugly, and frightening in comparison with GQ murderers. Again, it is not in the media reports inside the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the movie - just exaggerated performances and visual effects. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. Evidence that the film has failed in its message is based on actual actual reactions to it. Some susceptible young people who saw this film cited it as inspiration for the murders they committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspired people in the opposite direction with terrible results in real life. A smart message is nowhere to be seen.
