This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film coincides with the quality of such films as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever," but these players also had a name where this was short. The "eye candy" of this film looked like 50 women with a bad face. (just an example of quality). I would rate this movie negatively if possible. Ladies I have to tell you that men were not bad to look at, but not much. If you would like to see this movie I recommend you to save money.
