I'm a big fan of low-budget horror movies like this, but come on! It must be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! He ignored the review published on this page, which she thought would be in my throat in horror, but it bored me and turned it off. Find Out: Wardrobe: It consisted of cheap hairdressing outfits and painted outfits from your home warehouse. The masks were made of what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> They play: it was terrible! I did not mind dubbing. It's funny like Ittenbach's "Premutos" (great movie). The combat and action sequences were bad. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not watch any of the Schnaaser films. There are much better directors such as Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same gore and subject. Check Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm, and Necromancers.
