When a movie like "Dukes of Hazzard" brings more than $ 75 million, it makes some incredibly sad statement about the state of our company. Either we are collectively too stupid to hold such waste, or maybe I just will not realize how many people will address this sort of harmless waste. Hollywood had no incentive to do good movies, because if he pops a basket, then people will see it, because there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I went out for free despite getting a movie card. Dialogue could not be stupid. The pieces could not be more overwhelming and horrible. Perhaps this image "bigger, bigger" appeals to Texas, but neither to me nor to anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" were in this career end, except for Burt Reynolds who says all you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - do not laugh at me. I would never recommend this movie for a video, even if you were desperate. It was that the public was terrified that after opening the day, it would get enough money to match it, or it was better than it cost marketing. They did so despite the fact that the public was warned in advance. Silly abundance.
