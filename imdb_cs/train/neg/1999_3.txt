At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to notice the posterity case. For good reason! Super Ring has left its small gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no acute analysis of the characters on the crime scenes. Holmes whines for fifty yards behind the conspiracy. This strange CAM eventually confronts the old fragile - in a way that would cause the heart of Charles Bronson to be filled with pride - six beads in a bread basket. In the subsequent pursuit, the pursuer grabs one of Watson's shoes. You are not going to prolong the Cinderella story to make the film longer. Murder, Holmes and Watson, will escape freely. Well, it's a bit of a change in pace in the late Victorian quarter of London.
