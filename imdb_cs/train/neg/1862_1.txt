It's not just the plot itself, which makes this movie instantly off for a boring audience. It's a terrible direction with a terrible scenario and mistakes left and right, which is too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry, but I do not see "entertainment" in this case. Only excitement points to many mistakes and silly one-off ones. Well, I'm wondering how silly the directors think of their production company when this film was introduced for the first time. Probably as foolish as the sheriff, who walked into the tipping car full of anti-freeze with a bloody wound. Oops! I forgot to mention that this sheriff is not just a poor actor but can also lose a loop of antifreeze that uncovers exposed meat? I think he forgot to win the snowman.
