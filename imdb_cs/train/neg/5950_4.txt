My first question after seeing this movie was, "Why is LIAM?" If he wanted to tell the story from a boy's point of view, it was not good. Of course, in the music scenarios, there was a formal use of camera angles, but much of the decisive action took place outside of its field of view. If the "main" character does not have the ability to speak (apparently suggests a mute, childless position), it is difficult to give that characteristic a lot of depth. <br /> <br /> Melodrama is defined as: "a dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplified morality and conflict." LIAM meets this definition of T. The spectator is hit by the head with typical stereotypes of fire and the sulfur of the Catholic Church in a shed marmalade, and a well-fed priest who squeezed money from the parishioners. (Stereotype, which becomes very tiring.) What's more - the Jewish figures are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who did not think, she saw Tereza holding the toilet after her mother told her, "No daughter of mine will fuck another woman's toilet!" I'm a fan of British realism if it's done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
