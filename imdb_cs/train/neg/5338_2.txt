Elvis Presley plays "half" Indian ("Indian") who has to defend his reservation from ugly business magnates. Everyone likes to drink, fight, and make children. Fight, match, and "performance" replace each other with a stereotyped hand-raised expression "How"? Although he is wearing make-up, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he had appeared in previous films; perhaps he was preparing for his famous "return". It could not have been because the script of this movie was something that would make you so excited. Joan Blondell is trying to pick up Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war paint" should be ashamed. The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "green sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song for the Dominic bull. There are some surrealistic scenes, but he never becomes a brawler to succeed in this genre; "Stay Away, Joe" could give you some laughter if you have the right "mood". <br /> <br /> Otherwise stay away. <br /> <br /> Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury - Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
