Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushka and Casey Affleck are playing young students at Middleton College in Middleton. Four teenagers form two love triangles. One evening, during an ominous full moon, they roam and quarrel about a slippery and twisted mountain road. They do not look right to look after another car and one or more of them are killed. The scary nightmare begins ... Pretty miserable and politically correct horror without gore and nudity. Obviously, the "Soul Carnival" is affected. Cinematography is decent, unfortunately there is zero tension.4 out of 10 - just another forgotten waste bins.
