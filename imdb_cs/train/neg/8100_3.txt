Fire residues are films immersed in a flop sweat. I can not remember a movie that was so difficult to try to be so relentlessly provocative and important, but it failed so consistently across the surface. It's like a casual comedian who does not know but can not leave the stage. The stronger the movie is, the louder the laughter attempts, the more loud the bag is. The desperation that the film shows is so spectacular that it almost regrets everyone involved. The film laughs - loudness only twice. One day he is in the eyes of Gerald River, playing an unpleasant, arrogant and amoral television tabloid journalist - which is funny just because he does not seem to realize he is playing himself. Another scene that deserves to be laughing is the final "big moment" of the film, where the judge who plays Morgan Freeman presents a holy lecture about what morality is ("that's what your mother taught you!"). The pompousness of the moment is an insult that it is absurd. <br /> <br /> However, we must admit that it is a noble effort. It has a good, though badly occupied group of actors trying to print characters from thin cartoon cartons. The film looks professional and the little kinematic prosperity that director Brian DePalma just loves is obvious, if not particularly effective. But the film, which seems to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never goes beyond the level of cartoons. Satira requires style. Farce require energy. Even a sitcom requires time. But the best fire that can come is despair. You do not want to laugh at the end, you just want to turn away.
