This movie makes a promising beginning and then very confused and confused. Kamal Hasan has made great efforts to make the period look good, a pity that the plot did not take more time. Most small characters in the movie do not appear for any reason. <br /> <br /> Overall I am very disappointed to recommend to avoid this movie.
