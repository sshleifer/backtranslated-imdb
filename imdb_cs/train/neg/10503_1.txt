I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented DVD from Blockbuster .. Actually I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I will not say who ...! (It's still under the railing ..) But I have to admit it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? Hats down on that guy .. But it's a shame he was not in the movie long .. What the film lacks is an idea, a script, a sound, etc. It can look like a good movie .. but it was not fun. Well, that my sister paid 10 pounds for renting 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this ... and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs for me ..! This is not my cup of tea! 0 of 10!
