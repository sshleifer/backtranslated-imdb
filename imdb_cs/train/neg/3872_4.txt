The movie never becomes unbearable. And tell that straight, she has nothing to prove, except maybe a sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy sexy figure that reveals a pretty sexy outfit. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see in both directions. There is no tension, little action, unintentional dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring places, and very faint behavior. Kevin Dillon is utterly worthless. Silverstone ... well, she was too focused on her acting, I confess. Yet, as I said earlier, if you have nothing to do, except watching a movie, it will not be so bad. 4/10
