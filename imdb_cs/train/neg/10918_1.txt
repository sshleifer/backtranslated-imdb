Manmohan Desai did some fun, though illogical films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he did some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. This movie is one of the worst movies ever to make, Mard ko dard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad that it cringe <br /> <br /> The British are making cartoons and the movie looks so weird The scene in the British hotel is damn silly <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of stupidity like Amrita attacking Amitabh and then the whole scene plus to the top is a movie even worse There are more gems like horse sculpture to get life, masks Amitabh haha ​​and more <br /> <br /> Manmohan Desai is wrong Music is fine Amitabh does her role in style, nothing but COOLIE, role LAAWARIS type Amrita Singh is fine Satyen Kapuu is ok Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is again her usual Dara Singh'sself is also customary
