There's nothing like looking at the giant robots fighting the desert desert, and Robot Wars adds. Sure, acting is miserable, the dialogue is sub and the characters are one-dimensional, but they have giant robots! Special effects in themselves are quite good. Certainly not as polished as today's standards, but they contain minimal computer graphics and instead use thumbnails to reach a fairly good age. His shortcomings can be easily overlooked for the short term, and it has some humor in parts that make him feel comfortable. I recommend it to all fans of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who are looking for a perfect hour of distraction.
