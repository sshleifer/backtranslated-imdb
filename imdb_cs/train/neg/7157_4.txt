1st Floor 5/26/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): A strange story about a Druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting the body of her granddaughter. At least I think it was a relationship. This movie features some exciting quality that resembles Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that Nicholson's performance does not matter in this film. All this is taken very seriously until the end, when some chilly individuals and attempts at mood moods do not work at all. Performance is not a problem here, but the story is. It seems that everything is not happening very well and the viewer has a lot of information and no real understanding of what happened in the movie. Christopher Walken's little shot performance is like a granddaughter's uncle, who of course gives him the best billing when trying to sell the film. Do not buy this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
