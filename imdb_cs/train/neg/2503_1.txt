What a bad excuse for New Zealnd. I am ashamed to be called New Zealander when this film exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). Cast is composed of a large number of local soap stars. The real-life boat is one of the island ferries that travel daily between the two major islands, and even has the company logo (dolphin) all over the set, including the ship's funnel. The ship is to be a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of cutting and aging all over the place, yet it should be a luxury boat on its first voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow peaks on the South Island of New Zealand in the background for God! It had to be very cold in USA / Mexico! The story is weak, acting is weaker, and New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I expect the New Zealand taxpayer to contribute to the production costs of this film, and it was a waste of money that was better spent on real production. I know kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck with labels in the cargo compartment, and the Taco Company is tagged on the truck's door, probably it looks like an American. But some brands are over the mark of the top - you think they would notice in the props department before joining them. I would like to go on, but in no case is it worth it.
