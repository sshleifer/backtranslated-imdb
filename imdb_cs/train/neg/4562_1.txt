I did not feel like I was raped like I did with CHRISTMAS CHRIST, but BELIE MAGIC WORLD is still the opposite of BEAUTY AND BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not so extreme. It's ugly, inconsistent, idiotic, and writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. Those are the characters we loved from BATB, there are lots of people. I wanted to cut it, but after a few minutes I gave up because nobody in the right mind would really take it. What we have here are three stories. The "Perfect Word" is an encouraging, brutal study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" works only if you can accept that the name Babette is actually Fifi and that it's James Bond's affection and that Lumiere is a female idiot. "Broken Wing" (or "broken wind", as I like to call it) is probably the most annoying of a bunch. Does the beast hate birds? Since when? Do not look at this bullshit - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a film classic, a transnational celebration of love, art, intelligence, and the human soul.
