I did not have a great impression on this movie, especially since I was in good faith going to the cinema with my family to see a 12A-rated movie in the UK. To my horror this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it is not good to follow with children). This movie was sometimes very rough sometimes with fart jokes, getting hit in the slacks, etc ... and for most of the movie it's not too funny. The prerequisite of the film is that Calvin Sims, a 2-inch jug, gets out of prison and steals a giant diamond, but is forced to put it in a women's bag. So the rest of the movie sees walking through a deserted child and getting to this ladies' house to get this diamond back. Until now I enjoyed most of the Wayans Brothers outputs - but this movie definitely takes a biscuit. Some good advice - wait until they appear on television or cable
