Jerry challenges Tom listening to the haunted story on the radio and taking the opportunity to scare his nemesis. I did not find this particular episode, which is funny: humor seemed rather limited and the whole setting was (Jerry is basically the "bad guy" in the one that suffers from poor Tom for some special reason). There is an occasional glimpse of inspiration (for example, Tom's literal "heart in the mouth" and the moment when his nine-year-old lives are being sucked out of his body), but overall this effort lacks frenetic stimulation, excellent animation and the utter humor of most other T & J cartoons.
