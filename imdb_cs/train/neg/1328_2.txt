This is a really stupid film in the typical 80s genre: action comedy. It is conceptually reminded of the Rush Hour, but lacks action, laughter and chemistry among the main characters of the film. Be aware that Jay Leno enjoys being a stand-up and a talk show host, but she can not act. He is terrible when he tries to do it hard - barely able to save his trademark from bowing by saying that his lining, which by the way is not very funny. And to see how it is running (even then) is not a pleasant sight. Besides, I feel that Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not provide the Japanese with a very politically correct impression. Do not even start my story. I give it 2 out of 10.
