All the internet buzz aside, this movie was a terrible god. I was expecting the film to be a farce than anything else. Instead, filmmakers attempted to make a serious thriller / horror movie, and they did it all. There were only a few good parts and a few good lines from Samuel Jackson. Besides, it was a lot of gore and some badly revived snakes. All internet fun was a mile better than a real movie. Now that the movie really came out, hopefully this joke dies. Do not waste time or money on this piece of exaggerated basket. If you're looking for something fun and fun, then go to the Hady blog.
