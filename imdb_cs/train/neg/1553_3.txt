This film really deserves MST3K treatment. A pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash story featuring twin barbarian brothers with collective IQ hot water, the names of characters that seem to be derived from the Mad Libs book, and such classic lines as "hold her down and reveal her belly!" Barbary they go to the territory "so bad that it is good".
