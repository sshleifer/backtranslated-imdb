No, this was not one of the ten worst movies in the 1980s, but it is definitely somewhere covering the bottom 100. This movie looks like it was placed on the shelves for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects preceding "American a werewolf in London ", a disco still considered super and Ronald Reagan is not the 40th President of the United States? While we are on this, we should not overlook those 1970 hair styles in the 1950s and 1960s. I saw it more than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" in combination. One woman who brought this movie to "so bad, it's good," was late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but only barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the idea of ​​a high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that was over at the end of death and is now launched in Hollywood, but also keeps her thoughts like "hot chickens". Her call to help is proof of it. Looks much better than Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in a beauty parlor, shot down to hell." She did not want to be kidding. This does not mean that there are no good parts in other places, they are very little and far, and I'm not saying just because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this one. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than this, and it was not that good. <br /> <br />
