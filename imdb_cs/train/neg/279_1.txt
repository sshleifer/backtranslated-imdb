Wow, here it is; action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget environment (do not miss the merry flying saucers several times), Seattle will find a hard body that has no brain to avenge her childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the performance of acting is just rivaled in stupid attempts to steal from other movies, especially the "Matrix" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we can see that some run on the walls and slow shots (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cold as attempts on a stupid, hard-headed body that has since made jokes about male incompetence. <br /> <br /> And yes, we have also served a number of leaders who lead absolutely nothing, as if the script were projected by the previously unseen cast in shooting scenes. Believe me, it's as bad as it can get. In fact, it does not deserve it seriously, but maybe some of you do not have to rent and save money.
