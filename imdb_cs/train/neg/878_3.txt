I can only believe that Garson Kanin had to be two people. Who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and funny "Born yesterday" wrote such great scenarios as "Adama Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and / or directed such a tedious , sad sound like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut" and this. Cast tries, but the screenplay is so tired and clich√© that even the efforts of the always beautiful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script falls to the fact that it is a superstition in a really offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. An ugly sequence, but sadly one that could easily play in the movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely verboten, but "funny" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
