A decent science fellow is retreated, so he brings his head back to life. Honest is the plot of the film. Trying to get another body that scans through the miserable space of the city to make a perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly point in the cabin near his cabin. That terrible movie style is ridiculous. Nobody in the movie can really act, including the head. The box monster is a man with a camouflage tie and you can really say that. The plot is slow, weak and the end is wrong. Check out the version of this move. Believe me people that I would not see this movie myself.
