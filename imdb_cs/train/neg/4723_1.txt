First, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> All of the former Yugoslavia, who are not an extreme Serbian radical, agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. There were no Serbian crimes. Fortunately, everyone sees that this film was made by Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All "experts" interviewed are not professionals at all. Some people read only a book written by radical Serbs, the other is genocide denier etc.etc. <br /> <br /> The film was also accused by the Slovenes. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and only because the Slovenians were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia and YNA could not get Slovenia into Croatia (after the start of the war between Croatia and Serbia). Every Slovenian is indignant with all the accusations of this film. Every reasonable Croat will agree to one thing: Independence was too early. Maybe we could avoid all major conflicts. However, the mention of World War II and some unrelated things was a pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine the Japanese throw a nuclear bomb into Seattle and Washington and say it was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence to strangle YNA soldier and assassinate Serbian civilians at Vukovar. But the reporter cassette will find that his claims about Serbian civilians at Vukovar are lies. The whole internet. And the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of Vukovar YNA (now on the side of Serbia and Montenegro - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegro) And let us not start with the Chetnik movement. In the beginning it was just a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and re-fighting Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but everything can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this movie. Few of the accusations are true. Every Croatian is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I believe I do not have to mention the denial of genocide in Srebrenica, a genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine a Holocaust denial. This movie is the same. And according to this film, Bosnian Muslims bombed in Sarajevo. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this film. Someone the director forgot to mention the brief occupation of a small piece of Macedonian country (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croatian, Slovenian, Bosnian, and Macedonian have never entered the Serbian border. If you are not Serbian and you have actually begun to believe in some of the stuff in this movie, know that Serbs have some propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims, and Macedonians are really Serbs who have created their history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this film is "small" extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And Serb radicals are very, very pleased with this film (about 40% of Serbs vote for radicals). I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called Documentary Film, there is very little truth, and my advice to all is: Be informed before watching this movie. Then you will laugh at all kinds of charges. <br /> <br /> Watch real, neutral documents on the death of Yugoslavia.
