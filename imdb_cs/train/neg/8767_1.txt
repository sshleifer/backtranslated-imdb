Is it a movie ??? Is that what Indians are trying to show? I think this is one more effort from the sick director to turn the Pakistani soldiers and in fact the country ... but what we, Pakistani people, know we always have India in every part of our lives ... not only in armed counters. Well ... it's badly shot as a movie at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and the writer just tried to overcome the shame of defeat in Kargil by Pakistani armed forces by creating movies like you .. <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta is trying to make some good movies instead of Nonsense movies
