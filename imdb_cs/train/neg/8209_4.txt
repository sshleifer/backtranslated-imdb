Although acting, other reviews, has been remarkably well done. Brad Pitt manages the role of an uncomfortable, unpleasant Austrian climber quite well. Another acting is fine. The story could be riveting but somehow it's missing - one can never comprehend or take care of the characters shown, so a story that could be quite dramatic does not fall into this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I could not try how I can get involved in this story. As a tired fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the five best actors of his generation), I expected to * love this movie - and yet let it cool down. But it could be in my tendency toward the creative end of this film - direction, script writing, production, editing - somehow lost to me. It's a pity, because it could be wonderful. Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should be wonderful. It was not. It's probably worth watching just to remember - but do not expect too much and maybe you will not be as disappointed as I am. It was mostly bored with me.
