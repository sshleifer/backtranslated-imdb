Guy, this was one gruesome movie! While I did not see all of Burton / Taylor's cooperation, I can safely say it's the worst. This rich but sick woman (of course, Taylor) owns this beautiful island in the Mediterranean, ruling over the staff who is in attendance when suddenly this poet is shaking. The entire movie is actually just a talking fest, most of which makes no sense. Even in 1968 no one could make the heads or ends of this demanding nonsense, and the time even more clearly mentions it. If it was not for beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would deserve negative reviews. The only thing for which this film is good is its unintentional laugh at the expense of the stars.
