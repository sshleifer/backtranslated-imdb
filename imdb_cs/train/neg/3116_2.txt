Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> But .... If I have to sit in the movie, they were: Director <br /> <br /> Director of Photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> YOU MUST NEVER USE THE DARK MICROPHONES Boom that appear and emerge from the film for almost every chapter of the movie, how can I look forward to focusing on the story, as well as believe in a darn thing when it reminds me of the technical aspects of shooting a movie !!!!!! ! <br /> <br /> WAIT ON DVD or DO NOT use
