An amazingly improbable and silly potohiler who has at least some redemption, sharp shooting, but it's too unbelievable that it's caused by tension. I was hoping Stanwyck would come back in time because she was really wet, more than one husband, and she was also an idiot child ... why did not she go with Meeker? But the annoying question remains ... What kind of wood was that support that was made of a rotten piece? Stanwyck, always perfectly professional, does the best she can with the material, but it's bad.
