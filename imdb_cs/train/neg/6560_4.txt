"Shadrach" was not my favorite movie type. I found out he was too sentimental and the acting was under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some other actors were not believable at all. I also did not believe Paul's parents left and left him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper at home. Their social classes were too far to believe it was plausible. Dabney's lifestyle seemed too exaggerated. At the beginning of the movie a scene appeared that showed that Andie MacDowell jumped out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was that? Her son? Which scene should show us? Why was the scene even included? It has nothing to do with the rest of the film and has never really mentioned it. It seemed free and did not fit into the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the movie. The story of Shadrach was nice, but I was not convinced that the Dabne would be kind and generous as they were portrayed.
