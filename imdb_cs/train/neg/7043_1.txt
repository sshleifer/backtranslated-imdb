I was ready to laugh in the entire movie as a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many friends of biker enthusiasts and from there decided to make a film. <br /> <br /> It is often undetectable. A lot of footage of cyclists on a non-industrial trip with the same music has played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Ren√©e Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon would probably revive things. Perhaps she had other commitments on the day she was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, bikers are terrorizing a small town. Fighting, murder, a cowardly cop, a cracked mechanic, etc. One cyclist always wears a football helmet, which is a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws. The script has nothing to offer. One scene contains a biker who attacks a woman and shouts on the lady's face. "You are the same, you are the same!". We'll go back to the scene for a minute and say again: "You're all the same!" Could not the writer think of something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, the boys killed the bad guys. We also learn that the marriage between middle-aged mechanic and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and we suddenly learn that Joe's wedding is still on (but with another bride). End.
