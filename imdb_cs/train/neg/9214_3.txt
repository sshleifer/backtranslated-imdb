Many things are clear when watching this movie: 1) acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict is bordering the soap opera-ish. The other two boys: a supernatural childish mystery and your stereotypical I-babe-but-I-I-really-sensitive-inside the blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and unsatisfactory; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are worrying (Tom Hanks); 4) The inclusion of initial love ballads is a special choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) strange lines and side charts are not made better by doing terrible actions; and 5) it's really a bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
