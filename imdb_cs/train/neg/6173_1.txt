This film is a spectacular attempt on the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and swinging. Some mistakes were possible at the time of the crisis, but I'm sure it is not so much described in this lame film. My first reaction was that Oliver Stone had to drive this movie, but this time I was wrong. There are probably many others.
