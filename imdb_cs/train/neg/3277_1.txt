If you've ever watched the Dukes of Hazard, you know you never have to worry about drugs, excitement or gross behavior that young children see. If you've seen a movie that you know it is not! This movie was HORRIBLE! Major characters do drugs and think it's fun and cool, it's definitely not what I'm saying fun. They made a wonderful show and they just turned it into waste. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, looks and looks as if she was getting a job at the corner of the street. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out, I was ready to leave for 15 minutes in the movie. I stayed to think that it had to improve, but instead worsened for a minute. I wish I'd never seen this movie. I had a good show, and when I left, I left nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth. Make a favor, you will see something worth your money, because it is not just a waste of money, but you will never lose 2 hours of your life!
