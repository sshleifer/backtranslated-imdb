Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but in general, it felt like a crash had collapsed. Campfire stories work best around the campfire intimacy. There were just too many half-round anecdotes of old friends and too big shots. I like The Clash and Joe that they have not been able to reunite and sell their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document has left me to focus more. Using campers without the right explanation of whoever says anecdote alienates the viewer to a certain degree. It was the conversation itself. Even with the "voice of the radio of the DJ" Strummer, the film was a bit glued together. And can anybody explain all the flags flying behind the camp scene? After the amazing "film and fury" I was hoping the Temple could deliver. Joe Strummer doc deserves better.
