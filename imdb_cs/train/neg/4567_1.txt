What a bad picture of professional police officers is shown on TV watching this alleged reality show. One can only hope that the real reasonable suspicion that leads to the probable cause that leads to all the circumstances surrounding the "stop" then "Pat Down" on the outside of the garment, then to be able to formulate why the officer went into someone's pocket and pulled out the counterblade, was removed from the scene, because if it was not, the arrest in most places would be worthy if they even got a supervisor pass. The Radio Broadcasting Order Report does not constitute the actual existence of the order unless the person who dispatches it has the original guarantee. If the dispatcher reads from a computer print, it is good enough to be arrested, but it does not necessarily mean that the command is still valid. As CBS did not see any outgoing claimant (maybe I did not want to), CBS might have trouble.
