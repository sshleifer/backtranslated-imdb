Van is a movie about the guy who is trying to attract the girls into their new van to pick them up. The only thing this movie does is fail is to accurately depict the US missile shot in the late 1970s. Looks like it's been done by amateurs. It's rubbish, but I love it! I have to admit that I'm a fan of the 70th basket! I hope it does that on IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
