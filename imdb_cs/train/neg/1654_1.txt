Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> *** Possible Scene-Specific Spoilers (But Who Helps Heal It) *** Yes, That's True: Zero. And I rarely give 1. Even for the weakest movies I'm looking for things like music, cinema, imagination, it's humor, even a good tempo in terms of the most objective score. Look at it within its own genus or subgenus. But nothing is redeemed here. I do not remember that the movie actually sent me to walk up and down the room. The only reason I did it to the end was that it seemed to me that I could not change it-I was just staggered and watched what insulting stupid piece would come next. It was like watching a snake spend a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and pull this kid away, yes. First, there is nothing technical about "whipping" that works. The visuals are all in the sitcom style. Editing scenes of all street traffic pictures go through the night over and over again. Music and scores not only contribute to the film - it's unpleasant. Not to mention that it has nothing to do with it. It's playing as a cardboard as it all comes in, and that's true for Amanda Peet (apparently the "star" who got this train losing her green). These guys, supposedly good friends, no longer have a hemisphere or a sense of intent when the director, Peter M. Cohen, rounds off the bus station minutes before filming. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, t original bone in the body. He has no imagination. It does not show us anything we did not see thousands of years ago. The whole premise or "twist" of this film is based on masking and "the idea" that able women can play men "just as they are playing." Anyone who thinks it's an intervention or somehow original is probably never turned on. Twisted, shallow women are common. Men's load is the norm. It's not a special steal, it's worse: it's a clich√©. I can not imagine women who made a film that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with that feeling of contempt. I'd like to rent the "Men's Men" - or even better, "There's something about Mary." This movie wants to be the "edgier" version of "It's about Mary" so badly you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no views of women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen is simply pleased with the wreck of myths he has been broadcasting from other sexist films. At the other end of the film, it does not even work like satire, because even though it is ripe with exaggeration, it can be considered "satirical", it does not have the real earthing that needs satire. He does not even know what's going on. Then there is a dialogue that is a little more than those that scream at each other for obscenity. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Coat 2: "Oh yeah, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, the thing that could apologize to all others confidentiality: There are a lot of fictional films, no good acting, morally repulsive characters and obedience that were fun and fun, so they were good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a moment. He has no comic skills or timing. All the situations are completely false, not based on any breaking of the truth, especially enough to laugh at us. These characters are basically drawn by joining SEEM to the lowest lowest common denominator. Look at the "scene marquee" scene, "classical classic" hair gel scene. One of our crazy anti-heroes opens a medical cabinet and sees the vibrator Meny (Peet). For some reason the light shines as if he had found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men react in this way to vibrators I do not know. While diving, he drops to the toilet and then tries to catch his bare hands as Mena looks at him. Oh my side. <br /> <br /> But strangely, people really like this movie. Of course, people like "friends" and reality, so I should not be surprised. All of this has a common thread. "Whipped" is a great proof for me that America has a huge pocket of people who will laugh at any joke just because it is sex. They will enjoy any show or film (or think they like) just because they are dating or relationships. It is a lack of any quality that does not concern these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want white teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated blindly lapping something dating / relationship-related sales are cheap, empty, effortless television, movies and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only tutorial will be that when I die because I've seen this movie, I have the credit to get 80 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br />
