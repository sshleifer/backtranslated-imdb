The only reason I'm worried about commenting on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and perhaps your money. I bought her ex-hire for Â£ 3.00, it looked interesting, so I got a chance. Within a few minutes after turning on, I realized that I made a mistake. All cast should be stored until winter and then willed to the nearest firewood where they could meet more of their kind. As for Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), it should only be done before he did this waste. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it in stores, run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
