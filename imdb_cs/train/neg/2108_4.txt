Several brides are mysteriously murdered at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen on the way to the morgue. Journalist Patricia Hunter has decided to investigate these mysterious kills. She finds out that before each ceremony the bride was given a rare orchid (allegedly from a groom) that contained a strong drug that subtracted them. Patricians are told that the orchid was first developed by Dr. Lorenz, who lives alone, with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz responsible for the crimes by brides in a suspended state and using his gland of fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenzo on a medical background around his wife), is trying to force Dr. Lorenzo's hand by setting up a fake wedding that will eventually bring Patricia into bad medical connections. This film had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many shots and other faint scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and the coffin deserve better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (even for not giving Lugosi one of his unforgettable performances, even with regard to his monograms), because Countess plays Lorenzo's role with the qualities of the many stereotypical qualities of many of today's Hollywood prima donnas. Weak and conceived will also end up. Rating based on B, 4.
