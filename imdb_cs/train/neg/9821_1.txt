I often do not look at a movie that is as bad as this movie. I kept on watching, every minute she hoped it was just a joke, just to find out that she needed to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre asks. The game was shameful, and the situations were frightened and clich√©s. If the movie was made in 1920 (for example) And should have the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) towards it, we would think the cinema was naive at that time. As it happened, this film was shot in 2000 and I still saw a silent era movie that has such a magical feeling as this one. <br /> <br /> Surely not for a serious filmmaker. /> <br /> [Not rated]
