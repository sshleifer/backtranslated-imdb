<br /> <br /> What is this movie somewhere on average 6 stars is outside of me. The script is so banal and sincerely an insult on which life is based. Cinematography comes straight from the smooth world of advertising, and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show surprise by participating in this movie if we look at her tracklist. Overall, it's a "high-end" movie that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
