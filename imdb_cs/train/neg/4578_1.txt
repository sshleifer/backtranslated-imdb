Another cult strikes again. It's not a spoiler, because the end of REAL comes after you've been exploring the people who brought this too long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramth's School of Enlightenment. If any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like screen, I left. Thanks to Ramth I saw a borrowed copy of this movie on a friend's recommendation ... that the useless expensive resources on this New Age lobotomizer would be tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can walk on the water" to get this leadership to a "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, drown ... or close :-) Like a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" to its entertaining value, especially to create the most distinguishable character in the film history (the roommate photographer ... eeeeeek!). If you have to see this movie, borrow it from one of the people who invented the brain who recommended it.
