There are some movies that you know are going to be bad. Even if you have completely forgotten the work of Ed Wood, look at this commentator from "Plan 9 of the Universe," and you know that you will not see another film masterpiece. That's when I saw Uwe Bolls' first film "The House of the Dead," with that guy sitting in front of the house, who started with his introduction and tried to sound desperate as if he had just arrived from Sin City, m in for helluva. <br /> <br /> So the movie begins this way - first the main character says everyone else will die. You know, to keep you. Then he starts to load the rest of the character with rows like "Karma .. thinks he's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia ... my ex ... recently we said goodbye, I had to study and she had to get busy." No, I'm kidding. Anyway, this group of 20 people who could not get out of a wet paper bag would go to the "Rave Century", raving in doubt were several tents, a porthole and a dirty stage set on a small island in the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately it finds a way to get there, how a fishing boat runs Kirke (Cpt Kirk, make sure the guy who wrote this script is a genius) and his assistant, a bastard child from Simpsons Cpt McAllister and the murderer who knows what you did in the summer. <br /> <br /> In order to shorten the long story, the gang gets to the island, no one can find except the bloody shirts and then decides to take the hell out of here. No wait, they do not, they really like each other and it's like it's free booze. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the film throws the rock bottom and then continues to go up the hill against every chance. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there's some shouting and shooting, our gang goes to a house to meet some other gang, they come out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some policeman (who has about 500 free weapons) and then you decide to return home. Somewhere along the line they transform into S.W.A.T. by entering the Matrix, the boys will start to breed like bacteria and start crying because I paid for it. To add an insult to injury, every few minutes there are video game shots on which this marmot is based, and there is a cute play-through cut-scene for several characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I really hate this movie. It does not even fit in the famous category "so bad it's good". It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are horrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad. The list simply goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie just because of its terrible reputation. No. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
