As other comments show, this movie could scare you when you are a small child. (And that's probably all that's good for.) If you're older, but this movie does just one thing: mainly suck - and I do not think that acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like this. I'm simply talking about a "plot" (if you can call it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> (if after reading this video you really want to watch this movie), but if you have gone to any school, it is just a big insult to your intelligence. When I watched it, I was amazed most of the time because what was happening was just stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: - UNITE formation (evil UN-association) <br /> <br /> -> we only have to believe it is bad. is it evil at all? if so: why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - a sign of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> is not necessary to save people, so why the hell (no word toy) do it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> so ... just say prayer before rising and you are saved - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> So the rating of 1/10
