"Private Practice" is based on the relatively successful and well-written "Gray's Anatomy". The theater is wonderful. The assumption may even work. But writing is just terrible. The pre-pilot, hiding like Gray's anatomical episode, was my first warning. The story was just fool. I thought maybe it was just a noise. So I set the DVR on the tape pilot and all the other episodes. As I watched the pilot, I only wondered how a performance with such a cast of subtle actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot must suck people and let them return. It had to be excitement, glimmer, great writing, an interesting story with cliffs that must be answered for the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this show had nothing to do with it. I was thinking it was just a noise, just watching the second episode that she hoped would be the best. And although it's a little bit better, it's not close to what needs to be interesting. I can not miss the television. I just cleared this show from my list of shows. It is not worth the IMO's effort, and I would be very surprised to see it even in the middle of the season. Go through these people.
