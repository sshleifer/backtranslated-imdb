All the ingredients of b-movie cult. Topless (and bottomless) girls, kung fu fucking chefs, slave traders, evil Germans with whiskers, Cameron Mitchell, and a sword-dominated zombie. And, of course, Camilla Keaton's breasts, which are best-known images, appear in the feminist exploitation of the classic I Spit on Your Hrogue. We also have to mention the Shepard jewels who play in the recent movie The Cooler Swing. Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in the bar, and a boatload of martial artists heading into some island zombies where bad combat artists go to death or something. <br /> <br /> Tops and bottoms look easy and frequent, as travelers are well mace because of the ship owner. <br /> <br /> Then the catastrophe strikes when their ship is destroyed and landed on the island of zombies, where the mass monks sacrifice young girls to the dead warriors to resurrect them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yum Yum Big fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Only thing for another zombie fest.
