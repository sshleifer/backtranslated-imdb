I could not believe it when I put this movie on my DVD player. I thought I would laugh good because I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn it off when I had a company, and they wondered what I heard. I ended it later and I had to leave it for soft-core gay clown porn. No, it launches a lot of jokes, jokes, incests, racism, dressing like KKK ... This movie is insignificant for anyone who has ever played D & D. No wonder it looks real D & D would not allow them to use their game. Who would want their name to join?
