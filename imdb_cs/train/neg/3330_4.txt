This film contains o.k. score and poor performance of David Muira as Dr. Hackenstein. Initial and final credits, together with most actors and "special effects", show that it is a low-budget movie. There's nothing in this movie that you could not find with other mad scientists, horror / comedy or low budget movies. It's not strange for lovers of naked scenes or lovers of bad movies. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Deller are not enthusiastic. If you are curious as to how I was and can really find you, you realize the truth about a single line of summary.
