This show is painful when you look ... It's obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, from constantly changing "jobs", buddies and cast. They seem to want to paint something on Amanda Bynes ... but they had no idea what came up with this dirty show. They filmed her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty-thirty years, and put her into adult situations in repeatedly unsuccessful attempts at comedy. Soon they realize they need "tapping" and throw people until the end of the 1920s to try to pass through as a teenager. <br /> <br /> As the show survived the 4 seasons it is out of my reach. Somehow, ABC decided that it was a "family" show and fit it into the afternoon ABC Family.
