Complete mixing. The unfortunate manifestation of hypocritical, toxic cultures ten years ago. In this film, pedestrians crawling for slavery go hand in hand with colonialistic overtones (an annoying redhead who serves Shaka rice?). Forget about historical reality. Did not most West Western slaves come from? The American slave easily captures Shakah with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been so unpleasant. Can we just think how he should go to the miniseries? (Fastest Sudden Distortion). The miniseries were excellent and it is unfortunate that DH should have hands on something unique and made it a secular one. (I tend to think he had a hand in creating this fiasco).
