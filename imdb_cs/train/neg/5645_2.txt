"I thought I would be locked in a padded cell, and they would throw the key." (This is a paraphrase capture of dialogue from the "state of mind." One is surprised by the entangled forest of Paula Milne and her co-worker finding the magic sponges they had to eat, creating this weak "whodunnit" and bringing such waste to our screens. Niamh Cusack has done the best (as well as the other actors), but her talent deserves a better vehicle than this. The culmination of absurdity has been achieved and this "state of mind" is best buried and forgotten and certainly not only "placed in a box and locked in a drawer".
