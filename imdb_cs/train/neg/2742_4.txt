It just happened that I came across surfing on this movie channel. my first reaction was, "God, no longer!" it's so swinging that you're playing a retard at this time, that it's become demanding and sincerely contemptuous. for some reason I stayed and watched until the end. maybe it was my belief in the actor and hoped they were giving me something that could make me happy. Ken and Helen can definitely act. also the film advances to something better towards the end and actually does it. <br /> <br /> helena bonham carter also surprised me by its character. jane has the middle side he uses to maintain distance and repel pity. then again she has a soft side that seeks love. the only thing that surprised me even more was the Branaghian figure ... it was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing special. Find out if you're an acting actor ... if you're looking for pure fun, you can skip this option. it sean penn seriously! oh, my, it was a bit harsh, it contains a couple of jokes ... not for the getaway.
