How did the spell flush the fat Italian, which can barely get rid of the martial arts without the need for a heart? In this film we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of success - since his career began it was a constant drop to the poor over the disgusting behavior that confused his career. In this movie, it seems that most of his training consisted of ordering fetuccini alfredo in his restaurant every day. He is bold, slow, and very old looking in this film, barely a fighting artistic action hero, more like the laughter of a clown composer. It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why. <br /> <br /> Plot: A fat Italian guy with a big reputation for strength gets wind that a criminal group can play around with a drug designed by the army to make the final reaction of the warrior. This pretense, though pathetic and ridiculous, gives the opportunity for some over the top combat scenes that include wall blasting as a comic book. Did I mention that this movie is completely upset and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yeah. I did.
