I liked the initial assumption of this film, which led me to hunt, but the problem I quickly discovered is that one knows a lot about what will happen during the first 20-30 minutes (the pair will come behind the mirror and take over all. <br /> <br /> There is no real action (which is fine), but the final revelation does not make much sense (how can it be without the uncertainty and fear of the whole movie if it is bad behind the mirror?) Scenes behind the Mirror "they were cold when they first appeared and the blonde murder is also effectively scary, but unfortunately it seems to be a movie that seeks a story or a more compelling scenario, it accumulates the atmosphere of the atmosphere and over the top of the terrifying sound design for 80-90 minutes it really does not cut , in fact, it's pretty boring.
