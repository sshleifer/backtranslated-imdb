The film has several stories that follow several different characters. Different story lines do not feel like one complete piece that makes this comedy very discontinuous and even annoying to ever watch. <br /> <br /> It may sound weak and clich√©, but it's true; You're much better watching the Crocodile Hunter series on Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and fun than this movie. I'm sure both actors and crew have a lot of fun shooting this movie, but the film does not give us great pleasure. For comedy it's simply not funny and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors even when they play it themselves! Their madness is simply not good enough to make the whole movie around and their scenes long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times. The film had quite some potential, I think Steve Irwin is one character that is strange, both interesting and fun to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about crocodile hunters, it was my first reaction; brilliant! The film, however, is heavily suffering from a faint story and incoherent story lines with uninteresting and dysfunctional characters. The film has a certain amount of fun, at least enough to make this film traceable at least once, but I would definitely recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a waste of time. Still this movie can be watched only once when it gets on television, on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but the stories of the line really completely destroy the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
