The film is based on an original novel from the 1950s. Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners," "City of Spades," and "Mr Love and Justice." I read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, perhaps an experiment that is not over. But McInnes's work is highly acclaimed; and right. This musical is the ultimate nightmare of a novelist - seeing that the fruit of her mind has changed into a passing, ill-solved and soporistic one-dimensional apology of the film that says it captures the spirit of the 1950s London era, and does nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Colin McInnes was not alive to see it.
