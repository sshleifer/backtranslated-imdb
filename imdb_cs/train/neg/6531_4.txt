First of all, I would like to say that the user comments themselves have left tears in my eyes laughing. One remark that bad SF films are good comedies is just a sign. MST3000 has fed that. <br /> <br /> If you look at ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you will have the job. All the elements are here: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often cheerful childhood. The attitude of a teenage boy to sex, with the captain "gigolo" (good choice on it, guys!) Looking at the occasional "scientist" with the hair so red, it is a wonder he does not issue fire alarms. Sensual concept of Mars as a planet so strange that everything is red, yet one extraterrestrial monster has a mouse face and a blob the alien has an eye that rotates like a toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) That sounded like he never finished his 8th year at Brooklyn and had a psychotic fixation on his ray guns. And, of course, the very fact that a stranger is dangerously evil. If these people met with E.T., they could be bored in two seconds! "OW" really! <br /> <br /> Do not do me wrong. Rate this movie is low. Yet it is never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make it all the more ridiculous), and you have to admit that in your little core you will jump several times. <br /> <br /> Well, then do not admit it. I think you've never been 10 years old.
