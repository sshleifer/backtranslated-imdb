I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this wreck a wreck of the movie and suppressed the poor Stevie Wonder into the eternal blending of his beautiful music with this theater disorder. I also do not like the way she uses bad guilt as part of the normal prose of professional blacks. Abusing his possession of ethnic films is a pity. Scenes that look like they are made in blue and have nothing to do with the theme or the sub-themes play as if some college boy wrote it. Especially I think about the absurd scene where both eyes are playfully sparring for no reason and the cops come and snipes up snipes. Overcoming leadership leads to the feeling that Spike has no respect for his audience or no idea what the movie is about. The final scene seems worthy to justify the use of a hammer hammer to get closer to the point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the word F in a casual conversation. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same pool as he is not being grown as a filmmaker. I think his connection with Scorcesee in Clockers was wise. He should apply for documentary films, such as four small colored girls. Shock movies do not make Oscar.
