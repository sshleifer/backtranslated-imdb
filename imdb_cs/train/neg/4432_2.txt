Tatie Danielle is about a haunted old hag who, by loving excitement, hurts her loving and unknown family. There is a subtext that might be about the French colonial past, but mostly only Danielle does such things (such as deliberately leave the little child in the park) that soon will have a teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, it will not happen here. It looks good and the acting is fine and the concept is not really bad, but it's just sadness. God, this film loves itself. It's a pity he's not as smart or fun as he thinks he is. The only stimulus in the show - sorry, the movie - is that Danielle becomes sharper and sharper and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly unlikely ways he does it. That's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what it is, with the added "bonus" of glories of grandeur and 110 minutes of running.
