I guess the reason why this movie worked so well in the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first film from "Beverly Hills Cop", so when he was hot. Since one produced more than two hundred million and it was R and it made about 80 million and it was pg says it was not so popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I did not care too much. This one has Eddie as a search engine for lost children. He has to find a golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is not comparable to special effects. In the 1970s I saw better things than some of the things that this one offered, Ray Harryhausen did better things. Still, the main reason why you see such a film, because of Eddie, unfortunately is not funny at all, and it seems stupid to put him in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scenes. I think they're hoping to be fish from the water, but it just does not work for me.
