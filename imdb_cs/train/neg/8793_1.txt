For those who decide whether to watch this movie and read these comments for review, I first offer these four words: Do not waste time! "Chungking Express" was so filmed, quick-knit and seemed to be perceived by someone standing in line with Hong Kong Burger King. I can not remember that I have ever been watching a movie with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters who have tried to pass through the scripture of this worldly world! It's an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers a terrific revelation that "tears can be drained by the fabric, but the water needs time to chew"). The same character is also seen in a deep, meaningful relationship with towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, and so on. Restless, traveling, manual camera work was another annoying feature I could do without. And if it's not enough for you to get into your popcorn, we hear the 60's "California Dreams" from Mamas and Papas, which repeat over a sound track over a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loss to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions, although for life I can not find why a man might bother with his talent. He was known to have commented, "I'm glad I love the film so much." Many of us, however, hope to concentrate on making their audience satisfied with other valuable discoveries in the future.
