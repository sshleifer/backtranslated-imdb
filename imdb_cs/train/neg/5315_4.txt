Kol, a space-based space prisoner, can carry a space shuttle and escape into the woods of America, where he and some of his newly discovered friends try to escape the "cybernetic" Alienator cyborg machine. the best film about Fred Olena Raya's career, "Hollywood chainsaws," this can not help, but it seems to me a bit disappointing. Just like a low budget like the previous movie, but not as fun as I had with him. None of the actors really give up on me. The film is fine for a non-discriminating viewer during a rainy afternoon, but that's good for me. <br /> <br /> My rating: D + <br /> <br /> Where did I see: Showtime Thriller
