The original Japanese film "Gamer" from 1965 http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was basically an update of the darker and less sensitive Gojira (Godzilla) for the sensitivity of the 1960s. Gamer, of course, is a huge flying flaming turtle that literally consumes energy - not as big as some versions of Godzilla but generally similar in most directions. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and recruited by notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Godzilla King of the Monsters, the "Gammer invincible" is more than just spelling. The American scenes are not nearly as absurd and annoying as those who joined the Grand Gojir, but they do not add much to the story, because they are not very few. <br /> <br /> The film begins to promise, there are several scenes worth the character of development, and there is enough personality to create some tension outside the main plot. But as soon as Gamer appears, the film begins to fall into a relatively running kajju movie. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty good - even American accessories are fine. Direction is pretty good for this period and genre, and special effects are not bad at all for your time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are really good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is, of course, that there is little about this film. Gamer, however, is developing a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a fan of Kaiju.
