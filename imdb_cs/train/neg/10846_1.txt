Not since Caligula had thought about halting the movie halfway ... but then with that I was only 15 minutes when I thought about it. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure not. <br /> <br /> It's not that the cradle of fear is shocking or cruel or spooky or scary or sexual. It's not one of those things, but so desperately everyone wants to. Instead, it's boring, tedious, common, predictable and incredibly badly done (video-clipped, special effects in high school, no sense even for basic visual narratives, dialogue barely audible ... not that it's worth it to hear, when). /> <br /> This film proves the argument that even direct video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
