I can not stand in most of the reality shows, and this is the worst than Paris Hilton, and it's definitely his company. But "you are released" or "you are hired" for how many seasons? After watching the show, I would not want to work for that guy with his ego and everyone, and I think I watch the paint on the dry has more entertainment valve. I'd like to hear only one person get up and say "Donald ended up taking some money and bought a decent haircut." I see that even trying to buy fame in the WWE. I hope he hurts him, so I do not have to see his sad face anymore. It must be sad that you want glory so bad and you do not have the talent and do the ass that you are trying to buy. I would give this show a negative mark if I could, but it gets 1 and it does not deserve it.
