Of the ten actors who portrayed Phila Vance in the show, Edmund Lowe seemed the most visible, but in this scenario, the audience is far ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the joker, Douglas Walton, looks obviously in the universe, apparently hypnotizes and says something like "I have to go and be killed," I felt stupid that no one was picked up after his killing. Police thought it was suicide because he said he would do it! After the hated owner of the Gene Lockhart horse is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort is doing the same thing, saying he is about to kill, and then lethally jumps off the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally screamed "I have it," as if it were a revelation. The wine side was cleverly hidden and there was considerable tension when the party began to hypnotize Lowe to force him to jump off the roof.
