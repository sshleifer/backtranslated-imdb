Oh, the spirit of '68. Parisian streets rebelled with wild rising, hippies were high in the spirit of love. How did Britain mark this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm, by appearance, the dear Old Blighty focused on making films about boys in boarding schools. If ... contains evil. Contains a rising uprising.

It's obviously anti-establishment movies in the form of bad top classes that rule in prison and obsolete autocratic practices of pish-posh public school. What does it do when ... it's unusual that for all its radical sympathy it does not mean that it is clear that there is utter tension between human decency and the despotic school system, instead it is just such a swimmer: missing conspiracy and lack of personality . <br /> <br /> Surreal bits disappear and appear occasionally and the movie slides out of black and white into color again (is it because of a low budget or is it an artistic expression?), but there is little interesting talking.

Apathy is more like, the only man that a lot of viewers will want to stick to when she looks ... whether she's Lindsay Anderson.
