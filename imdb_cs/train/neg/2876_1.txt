I touch the theme of the creators of this fictitious description of the BTK killer motifs. Are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think the people who deal with this monster are enough injuries? What unexpected disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like an experiment on the personality: What makes you more nervous, slaughter or human murder? They used the real names of some victims ... this movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film have used this tragedy for their own program! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
