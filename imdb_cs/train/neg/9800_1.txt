Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, allegedly based on a Japanese television show that began in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese action movies and serials, you would think I was going out of this show. <br /> <br /> You could not be wrong. What worked in the Japanese version became the complete abomination of a television with powerful Morphine power rangers. MMPR is based on five teenagers who gain the authority to become superheroes costumes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this premise is far more and more ridiculous than anything in one of the Transformers films, but the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked. bad and I mean really bad movies and the players who play in this series have completely disappeared from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you choose, try to look at the Japanese Zyuranger series. > <br /> What's happening with the terrible long rainfall of 1990 and all the earrings on guys? It all looks like a woman!
