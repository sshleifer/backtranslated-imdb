I miss this program! There is no humor and it is too far away to call it "fun"! It's too excited for me! The characters are very stereotypical and uninteresting. Land is redundant and morals are repeated over and over again. Where's the fun? I also feel that it has been too long for the BBC to broadcast too much. Does it really need to have a T.V slot every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to return some of their older shows like Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Coon, and Count Duckull. I thought the BBC where the Danger Mouse brings, what's wrong with that ?! 3/10
