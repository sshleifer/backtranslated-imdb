This kind of movie has already become an old hat, right? The whole thing is a syrupy nostalgia that has appeared in some feedback. It sure sounds like a good idea: a great cast cast, some good gag and some human drama about what it could / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event linking them together, as was the case with "The Big Chill," one of those key films that have become copies of movies like this one. You will end up wanting to see more than one or two specific people instead of getting in for a short time. The above average is not only unpleasant, it's crazy. The below-average script will not help.
