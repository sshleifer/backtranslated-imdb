I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in a propaganda film and boredom. I hoped the film could be a real documentary about visiting Michael Moore at my local school, the UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to hit conservatives and the local religious community. It certainly seems self-service to the filmmaker to create a document that reflects only his prejudices about the problems. What's more surprising is to see all the "10" voices sent out by his actors. Did they even see a video? Golly gee Batman, this must be rated by all presidential men! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /> <br /> Yeah, like saving voices on IMDb will help lame movie. Maybe my voice will help balance it.
