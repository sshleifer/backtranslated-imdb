While surfing the channels we found this film with its promising summary. We were horrified at flat acting and drafting. We found fun screaming scenes from the car, incredible shots and sets that collapsed with tyro-foam and cardboard. What was even more fun was to see all the recycled scenes from "Dante's Top" where the front of the church falls into the school bus, the business queues separate from the main street, the overpass collapses, and the red car accelerates along the aisle as the bricks fall on them. It was a good laugh, though unintentional, and lets the viewer wonder if it was originally intended as a low-budget spoof of catastrophic films.
