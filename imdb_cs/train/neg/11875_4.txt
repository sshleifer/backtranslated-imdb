Mmm, does not the big stack of pancakes have a good sound? Maple syrup and fruit are preserved at the top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Make another bite. Other. Other. EAT. EAT it, you! Keep it in your throat for as long as your face does not fade with nausea. You just lived through Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I came across this show in the winter of '98 and was immediately bent. Just like the stack of pancakes I tried. But the experience soon lost, as the figure of Ally McBeal (who seems to be cute and cute at first glance) will soon become the most unpleasant, uncertain, whining complainant you've ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my wife to the spine.) Gags and tricks are also hackneyed, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is in your face) becomes a grid, and the constant character of change and transcription make a show into a damn soap opera . My advice is to make this show in small installments and quit as soon as it becomes annoying (and it will). I got it in 2.5 seasons before I enjoyed the fun. It was good when it lasted, but as a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it became ugly when it survived its acceptance. And next time you go to IHOP, skip pancakes. Order something healthy as a fruit cup. He'll be much better with you.
