This film thinks that the others I've seen with Combs have been an accident. The plot had more holes than I thought I'd ever seen in a movie that would be more than a "b" movie. The negotiations were so ridiculous that even the memories of the previous Combus camp triumphs were not enough to save. Considering the scenario, I have to imagine that there is not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am completely upset that I have paid for declining prices for these garbage. The fact that it was made for television was something that would help me avoid this atrocities, and frankly something that would have to be warned of those poor films. Avoid this movie no matter what.
