In today's modern Eastern Europe, life is difficult, and for young women, prostitution is one of the career paths and the only one Melania has reluctantly accepted. It attracts American attention, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying her more and more money until she finally wants to buy her. She has two pussies with different emotional attachments to herself and she is generally passing around like a piece of luggage that does not have any of her own feelings. We are, however, in the area of ​​"modern art in cinemas", as a narrative structure, the illumination of the building so that it can be seen, the camera techniques that supply rather than disperse from the action and vaguely coherent conspiracy can be abandoned. Many times I did not know what to do, and I rarely cared about it. People started to leave the screening just before the last late partners arrived, and I do not think I ever saw so many people who left. The pictures are important to the director - the characters slowly emerge or disappear into the dark screen, we get long lasting shots of nothing concrete and one sexual scene takes place in the infrared light. In fact, for such an unconventional film, sexual scenes were remarkably common; missionary positions among the naked people in the bed overflowed and there were no drugs or related strangeness. But perhaps it is common in these days, it is unconventional. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost without merit. <br /> <br />
