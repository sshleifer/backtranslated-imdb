The BDSM "sub-culture" Los Angeles drummer serves as a backdrop for this low budget and a clumsy mess, apparently a venerable piece for his best-paid player Celia Xavier, who also produces twin role-playing scenes as sister Vanessa and Celia's twins. Soon, the question arises as to whether a somewhat exaggerated camera, lighting and cutting pyrotechnics will never reach a point of association with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by the viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the Los Angeles region, while her evil girlfriend has become an icon in her fetishist world, mainly due to erotic performances on the CD-ROM, but when the disaster hit "Mrs. Vanessa" Celia, determined to uncover the evil assailant his sisters, begins a new job in a private Castle Club as a "sexual slave" where the specialty of the dungeon party is. Two FBI agents in the field (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is seemingly needed due to her involvement in the BDSM website), besides the police detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, are designed to investigate the crime and, at the same time, try to ensure Celia's security, the new profession is so moved by its customer that it has created conditions for personal danger for her. There are shortcomings in logic and continuity, such as the murder attributed to the Operations-South Bureau, the metropolis area that is far from the location of the film. Direction is not blurred and does not support irregular post-production editing and sound reproduction. This photographic gymnastics culminates in a top-of-the-range fitting near the end of the previous film, but tangential to the script. Between this troy, one solid play appears: Stan Abe as an aggressive agent of the FBI.
