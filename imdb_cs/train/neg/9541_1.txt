I think many people comment on / review their first IMDb movie because the movie was spectacular or terrible - I write about the other. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to continue with the "Wargames" .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once. In 2008, I had great hopes for what she would do with this movie. Computers, gaming, terror, military exaggeration have grown so much since the first film and "Wargames: The Dead Code" has the opportunity to bring it all into a big movie. <br /> <br /> The film has failed almost at all levels, but especially blamed for writers and anyone who has had some input about the realism of game aspects. The "Dead Code" was an Air Flight Simulator from 1990 with several people on the ground waving his hands. Meanwhile, Will Farmer will push around 7,000 orders - none of which affect what's happening on the screen. Until he eventually "won" by clicking on the frame on the screen with a mouse that releases a gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody near the gas). Because he defeated 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, RIPLEY says he is a high-level terrorist threat. Although every 5-16 years could complete the same role - the government believes it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "My expertise on bio-terror" ... He showed less knowledge than anyone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Bio-Terror Wiki. So then the film's long chase scene continues with about .01% of the budget and the excitement of one of the Bourne titles. He has about 1000 opportunities to catch him and to clarify the whole matter .. sometimes they are crazy that he is barely missing .. but sometimes masterfully create opportunities just to let him intentionally follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I'd write another .. but I've lost 1.5 hours watching this, I'd rather watch Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac toe for 1.5 hours.
