We all said, "Why do not we run the slasher films that were just fine instead of overturning those that were great just to make it better?" well with Prom Night rebuilt the average but creepy fun of the 80's Jamie Lee Curtis movie and they did even WORSE. It's a painting by number slasher movie that clearly tries to attract young teens (hence no violence etc.), The knife in this slicker flick is blunt. The director spent so much time concentrating on trying to make a pretty attractive killer look a little scary that something else goes out of the window. Castings that include Britney Snow (which was great in Hairspray), try their hardest, but the material does not give them anything to do but dull and look scary. More annoying is how the deadly scenes will be heard, but it will not be seen). It also looks like the only place where the knife in this movie was working in the editing suite, because the movie looks as though it was crippled (I think everything that makes it terribly terrible ended up on the dawn floor so the kids are not scared). pouring money from the Americans who sent this movie to number one in the box office! Slasher movies are a lot of fun, but in the Prom Nights case I wanted to download the original. I've seen scary OC and Dawsons Creek episodes
