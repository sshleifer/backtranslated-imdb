Twins brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) reunited for twenty-five years to avenge their parents and take back their tunnel in a million dollars. Double Impact runs after two hours and basically does not give any real access to the conspiracy of Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while an evil twin brother is just as embarrassing as a good twin brother. Also, the action sequences are not so exciting this time, and Jean-Claude relies more on shooting and then on his martial arts. Also supporting cast is useless and in two hours the film is just boring. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
