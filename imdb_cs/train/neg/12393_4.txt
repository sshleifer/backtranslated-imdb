When I got this film from my work, along with three other similar films. I followed with very low expectations. Now this movie is not in itself bad. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in the movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's not that bad for cheap excitement. I would probably never watch this movie. In short, it is a movie you would see either late at night on a local TV station that wanted to take some time or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon at a local TV station that is trying to take some time. Despite bad behavior, clich√© and subgroup. I did not have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend it never fits into my DVD player. The story is often performed in many films. This is no different, neither better nor worse. <br /> <br /> Just average film.
