Lack of content in this movie surprised me the most. First of all, even though people compared it with Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say it's worse than Rock On! So, the story of Creepy Cast Ajay Devgan You have to be kidding with Salman Khan and Asin. The music was fine Khanabadosh was the movie's trace the rest was bad! Vipul Shah is not yet learning from Singh's Critical Comedy to the King. Now Asin .. where it comes from apologizing for Asin's fan out there, but she feels a bad actress in this movie for a long time, she did not look good in any overdose of makeup! My final verdict follows Aladina with your family, and you're wasting your time instead.
