I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch her because I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early films. The film is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from NYC to LA to get past her recent loss problem. Shortly after I moved into a fellow who falls in love with her, it is obvious that she has the evil twins = doppelganger who pursues her. The film is pretty poor and bad. Both dialogues and gaming make the film really worth seeing. The summary is something for Drew Barrymore fans for him.
