How does the Scottish kilt love in purple heathland like it? Very, very carefully. Now I have a clear advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans take this simplifying nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four feet good - two feet bad", as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has the accent that production of "Brigadoon" Wells - the next-the-sea Amateur Dramatic Society would have bounced off. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with ladies - wore a kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmother once left the train in Edinburgh Waverley. And Auld Enemy, where would the Scots be hated without them and blame for everything? "Ms Roth, Cox, and Hurt should be ashamed of racist stereotypes." Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison, and at least Alan Rickman was funny.
