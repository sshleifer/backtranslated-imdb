Wow! I remember so many terrible movies that have been turning around high school since the early 1980s. They usually had an incredibly tight conspiracy and a lot of 27-year-old actors who looked like students. When I watched this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia growing up in the 1980s. However, I find out that this film was made in 1989? Tell me what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right here, it's just bad. In the park, the city is preparing to close a high school and threatens buses to all students in high school secondary schools. Which is special because the students of this school are rich and rich. In fact, the main character lives in the castle. Wondering how they can not find the money to live in this school, they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here's a kicker. The school council says they will keep school alive if students can earn $ 200,000. That's what the seniors do. Hmmm, you get $ 200,000, but instead you save for college, you put her on high school rescue, you're senior? And why exactly do the exhausted school end a year ago? And ... remember that this movie was stupid and made in 1989!
