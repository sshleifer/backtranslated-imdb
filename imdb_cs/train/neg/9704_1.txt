Well, if you have a few hours to waste or if you really hate your life, I say I'm watching this movie. If something is nice for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad that they are probably prohibited in most states. Seriuosly, the "PG" rating is also quite humorous as soon as you see native porn extravaganza. I would not give this film to my late nephew. You could not even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is prominent and clich√©, stupid and stupid. The game is terrible and the end is so painful that I watched that I actually started pour salt in my eye to give up my opinion of the idiot filling my television screen.
