Unfortunately, it shows up on star films in Thailand in the last week or so. It's complete rubbish. As another member said, this film is a good example of "not doing". I have not seen the film so badly acting for a long time. Actors (can you call them "actors"?) They are completely flat and bring their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to really understand how bad acting is, you would have to see the movie ... but it would be like torture. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed when the front lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or invented) is just as disgusting. Another actress with a fake British accent was pretty, yes, but a good mistress was a terrible accent. Mix with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She was supposed to say nothing, and I could accept her as a pretty girl. Oh, we can get to the scene where the loving front lady says, "Do you really?" after the forced crying scene from her. Ridiculous. No, I just laughed loudly. Sets and art directors offer the film a certain saving mercy. Some files are colorful and some of the scenes are pretty nice (minus actors). An old magic lady? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love that was in the movie. This is totally inappropriate for the period 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered a "big budget" at the time of its production in Thailand. I would be really excited to be the producer of this film. Just show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even average) movie. I would give King Maker 1 of 10, but costumes and sets to save the film from these ratings. 2 out of 10.
