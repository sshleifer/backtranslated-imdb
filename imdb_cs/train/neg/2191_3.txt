A doctor who is trying to complete a medical dream about a transplant secretly experiments with corpses from a hospital with various successes. His latest best story comes when he loves his girlfriend's head in the jacket when he rescues him from the burning vehicle. I was looking for cheese, and with this assumption I believed I found it. She has everything that bad movie hunters are looking for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons leaving the untouched white shrubs, unique camera angles (I always love tracking the rear personal car wheels), a cheese clarinet stripper and one of the longest deadly scenes in film history. But unfortunately these are so bad - good times can not overcome too bad - they - smelly sections. <br /> <br /> Jan in the Lord upset me, her droling monologues in a bitter whisper, somewhat less than a bad laugh, and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian homemade coffee and two DD batteries. I could not even talk to herself with an inexpensive and moral self-righteousness. Usually such a ham does these films have to see in my opinion, in this case I was bored with it. The best part of the film, in my opinion, was the 1960s version of the "body of shopping" and I even found out that I was going to yell at it. <br /> <br /> Do not scream money for this - there are better bad movies to entertain your sick sense of humor.
