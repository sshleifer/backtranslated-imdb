Okay, the first time I saw this movie on Cinemax 9 weeks ago, and I thought it would be a prize, boy, it was. This movie was great. I think the mother of the monsters shows her true form at the end of the film. I'm going "That's it, why does not she show it a little earlier in the movie?" The story is a mother and son on the blood of young women. It would not be better if they just went on, you know killing the fun of killing like a few young women, then when the sheriff or policeman learns and gets into the old way of killing monsters, rescuing a young woman / woman and killing 1 or 2 other people in process? I think it would be much better. It is also angry because the son is the main character and he first kills. Why first get rid of mothers? In addition, how does she have the strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She thought she was too weak. What was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never ever refuse to act on any movie of an actor, after all, trying to do the best. If it was not a good deal, I would put this movie 1/10. 3/10.
