Dark Rising is your typical bad, of course, quickly produced horror / sci-fi / fantasy film. It has a strange, inexplicable conspiracy with holes so large that you could plant an elephant. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on, but it did not matter, it was a simple demon hunter who came back from the hell of a dimension to save the story of the camp with confusing things about witches and a book of evil with fence elements and characters that make no sense or completely disappear without reason. Acting is bad, but frankly there is not much they can do with this script I'm guessing. There are a few impeccable scenes, which is probably the only reason this bad movie gets (like many other bad movies). Give this if T.V. there is nothing else.
