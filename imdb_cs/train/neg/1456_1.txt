Simply put, it is a simplistic and one-dimensional film. The title Rise to Evil should say that he will not try to be anything deep or much with Hitler's character. Rather than the first few minutes of the film, when we see that Hitler looks bad bad music playing in the background, we get a look at Hitler, who represents his supervillian caricature, seemingly torn directly from a Saturday TV show. The film really wants to make its case that Hitler is evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler is bad? In the end, it is such a unilaterally evil figure, both boring and confusing (it is necessary to ask how innocent, fysical in the cold movie sometimes convinces the nation to follow it or is the time man of the year). This movie had a great opportunity to take a character who committed the worst acts in the 20th century and tried to dive into her mind. Instead, he just says, "Hey, Hitler was evil, he just thought you wanted to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still being attacked for showing a very sympathetic view of the character. Give me a break.
