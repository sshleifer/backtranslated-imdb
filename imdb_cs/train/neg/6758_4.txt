Perhaps the prettiest woman in showbusiness and the northernmost, Debbie gives another great performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film. The cast is full of typical Melrose Place types, carved features and seductive curves I have never seen before. Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I'd seen before in a similar Delta Delta Die. The conspiracy focuses on a group of California arrogants who initiate a naive debbie Rochon on their crank. They tell her they have a murdering club, and they have to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to accept these great people, and so quickly kills a man, and now the group has to decide what to do with her after she falls for her joke. Debbie Rochon has several musical scenes, as well as many musical scenes, as well as many musical scenes, as well as many of actors and actors who are not named.) Pool party seems to be just an excuse to make everyone naked, just like a man and a woman. the character is gone after the first five minutes.) STORY: $ $ (You could get a higher voice because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot is a filler between the boring scenes.) B-Rate films often use nudity, but it is a borderline excess ). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (The purpose is at least below the level, Rochon is always on the reat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmares was better.) Danny Wolske does a great job Debbie's target of lust, but other actors did not have anything to write about).
