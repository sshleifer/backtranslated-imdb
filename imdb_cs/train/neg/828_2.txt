We'll see. In the St. Elsewhere final we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing was in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended by telling us it was a dream. And "Roseanne" ended by telling us that it was all in her mind. "It was just a TV show and it was not a reality at all. It's just that when you get into a great movie or TV show, you end up at least by wanting to believe it's all "real", at least in terms of the reality it displays on the screen, and this type of final series was twice earlier and was an old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch, and now "Newhart" is a dream - at least in a creative form that has far outstripped the expectation of everyone who loved the show, the idea was not fun, but it was so great that it was probably the finals in the finals, and Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being a loyal fan.
