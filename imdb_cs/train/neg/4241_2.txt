Yeah, Madsen's character - when he talks to a woman from a TV station - is right: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this film will not change anything about it. Okay, here are good cops, moral cops, even black, Christian, martyr. But that's a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not that. And most important for action fans: The shot is boring. It's just shooting, filming and shooting. Nothing more. Counter Strike, then you have at least what to do. The only morality of this film is: The LAPD is now good. No more bad cops. If you like uncritical, euphemistic ads for police and military service, check out this movie. It's the longest ad I've ever seen. (2 camera points and editing).
