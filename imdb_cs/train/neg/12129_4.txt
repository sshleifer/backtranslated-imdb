Before this film, I saw only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the evil zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), known among horror fans for his unforgettable performance from Man-Child Petra Barka and the pleasantly shameless giallo Strip Nude for your killer. Not one of the films was a particularly spectacular cinematic film, but they both talked in their own special way (and the fact that a lot of gore and nudity did not hurt). However, the massacre is dull, boring, boring, despite the relatively small mourning and strange place of unreasonable naked flesh. The story of a series of murders in a hotel where he played and the crew of a horror movie that's in the shoot is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin is not on the show, the film is a real fight to be seated it took four attempts to end, with infinite scenes of unbeatable characters who defend and make very few notes, and the only interesting point of the film is that his producer Lucio Fulci used several of his deadly scenes to release his mega-horror film Cat In The Brain AKA Nightmare Concert.) And if you've seen the movie, then there's just a few reasons why the massacre can bother you.
