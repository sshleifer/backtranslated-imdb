Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I always think. My wife and I were bored in our minds within 10 minutes. Not to mention boredom, it's absolutely unbelievable. Women (non-lesbians) do not buy together - nor kiss "unintentionally". Brothers and sisters do not live together in their 30s and go around the swing, dancing together and fitting into the night walks in the central park. Men do not know that their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and never met with the woman. Absolutely absurd. Heather Graham is perhaps the worst actress in movies today. He smiles when he wants to cry and vice versa. The only film ever to be done is Boogie Nights - not because it did not work. I can not emphasize enough how bad this movie was.
