How can the major German television stations send such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid everybody's talent. Even the famous Gottfried John acts very poor - especially in the scene of double murder - as amateur .......! The screen plan is very, very widespread - maybe 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to hit the track! The set is apparently very often a blue screen, f.g. scenes on a ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, sound and dubbing are very bad - probably the reason: different actors' languages ​​- but other international productions will do much more professional. WARNING: DO NOT watch - it's a devilish waste of time!
