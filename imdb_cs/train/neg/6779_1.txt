There is a high degree of expectation when you sit down and watch a comedy starring Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further reinforced when director Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so obvious, among others in DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes or so, it seems that these expectations can be met and then ??. Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy is cast into lead, heavy melodrams, catchy catching. Relative newcomer Suzy Parker was often criticized for her performance or lack of one in this film, but in a film in which even the big Cary Grant often appears flat and wooden, she attacks Parker's unfairly. Even a bright light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day would not change the richness of this gruesome, sad and utterly unnecessary scenario that stretches itself apart and pulls the interest and patience of the viewer with her. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, is still trying to breathe some life into the lead, but the terrible scenario is out of resuscitation. Desperate and hostile attempts to attract sadness from an honest audience in the final moments of the film serve only to add insult to injury. This film is nothing but the main disappointment at all levels.
