The guys who even blinked to watch this movie have already gotten some disturbing walk through their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack Ripper (actually you thought) his next B, I mean an E-Grade movie composed of a bunch of horny teens in certain sexual scenes that are being watched just before their spleens have scattered on a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or funny. If you really feel like a bloody stuff without conspiracy, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not get halfway through directing this dirt. Be careful if you absolutely have nothing to do in life and the one thing on TV is that Oprah Winfrey is crying on TV.
