Hatefully sad karate / horror thriller with lots of graphically violent violence and unreasonable nudity and a totally absurd and bizarre "conspiracy." This is fun with a low and low level of entertainment that will only appeal to audiences with a particularly fragile taste, but it is a bit cheerful and I have to admit that I was looking at it ... (* 1/2)
