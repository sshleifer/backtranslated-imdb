Bizarre for the Cinderella story. It's a terribly bad scenario, but Kathleen Turner becomes quite a decent bad step mother. <br /> <br /> In some parts, it is visually stunning, but that's all about it. The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 90s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save you full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for the Cinderella story - I recommend "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Glass slipper".
