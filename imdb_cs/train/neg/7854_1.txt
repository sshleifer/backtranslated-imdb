wow is the worst movie ever. the only reason I registered to IMDb was to complain about this movie. I never went out of the theater or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped it (and should have it). but I watched it until the end, just to get down with a totally terrible end. Wow, if it's all you can make, it's a long time. I have never seen the first and I never see this. his terrible deal with a terrible conspiracy. hey, it looks like somebody shining with a mirror lets us go see us. and the sad part is that when this movie came to the DVD it was completely turned away in a puzzle forever. so I feel bad for all the people who have seen this waste.
