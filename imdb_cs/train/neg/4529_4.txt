I will not describe the story because it was done elsewhere. We are great fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were interested. <br /> <br /> No wonder we have never heard of this "movie," because in 1992 it was a BBC TV film. Because of this, poor production values, grainy images, jamming, and poor sound are the reasons. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But you do not mind the mechanics because the story itself will fall asleep. It's an interesting human story, but not convincing at all, and it's hardly the end. You do not really care about the characters because their lives are as boring as your life watching this boring movie. Save two hours and do something to make more time.
