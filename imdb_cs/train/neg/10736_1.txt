The film starts with a pretty interesting scene, three people drink and make a small talk at the bar. All of them create a bit horrible stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the worst story is true. However, the film is not interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation becomes almost half the time in the film, and frankly, there is not much to see. The rest of the time, the director persists in God's deserted Russian village full of sad and haunted old ladies. Sure, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but admiring them goes too long, sacrificing any possible development of plot or character. I found this movie as another example of either a miserable or lazy film shooting where, instead of trying to make an interesting story, the filmmakers are concentrating on strangely fascinating pictures, and through a few hidden stories (the story of a meat trader's story) to find out all the chances and endings. The surface has an artistic appearance, but in this particular case there is nothing but a talent shortage.
