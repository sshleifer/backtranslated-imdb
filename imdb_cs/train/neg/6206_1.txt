Thomas Clay mixed with the wrong types. These are problems with young people today, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> It should really be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and somewhat annoying and turns into a drug that falls apart as if, like a director, it does not have a place to go. We are familiar with the main character, who is a little outsider, we see him at school and at home, which is not quite tasteful and felt uncomfortable, as do so many adolescents. Robert has come up with bad guys and started attending school and enjoying drugs, and before you realize it, he's a psycho-rapist. The film really is that Clay does not fully understand the links between violence and violent acts. It seems Clay thinks that the generation of crazy youth has become evil war scenes on our televisions. but he shot the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy real? If Clay did not see YouTube maybe he is naive and unconscious that he will be doing with the brutal top of the scene from his film? Anyone who wants to see is the worst scene since the end of the movie and I'm sure it will be what people are holding. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is useless in committing such violence to Clay, not only damaging young people who are actively engaged in preventing the war, but also committing themselves as the perpetrator of extreme and gratuitous violence for a better reason than his personal personality status. <br /> <br /> Damage to all involved.
