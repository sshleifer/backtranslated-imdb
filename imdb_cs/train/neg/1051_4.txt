Although Frank Loesser's compositions are some of the best that Broadway offers, they are linked by a lethargic production and an uninformed presentation by Joseph L. Mankiewicz - when it's over, you barely feel like watching a musician. It seems that Mankiewicz does not know how to present Loesser's demanding but melodic melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, "Adelaide's Lament", closes the Adelaide finale (Vivian Blaine) beauty salons; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual "Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat" has his support choir sitting in folding chairs while he's just standing. Mankiewicz writes all the fun of it by letting the static scenes go on for too long, and his dialogue (adapted to the Abe Burrows script) has nothing to do with his films like "All About Eve". Part of the blame must be on the guides, probably all of them are miscast: Marlon Brando looks confused why he is in the musical, Frank Sinatra plays a very nice guy and has no edges that make him so crucial (the songs are not adapted to his style) and Jean Simmons barely notes the way Shirley Jones could. Only Blaine, like Adelaide's love showgirl, gives us attention as Broadway for. The colorful artistic direction of Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created dazzling sets.
