This movie has its share of negative commentaries and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever to be filmed. It is true that most of the films based on King's works are quite bad, but this goes beyond the wrong empire. There is no frightening moment when you do not consider foolishness stupid. These are typical royal garbage - the myths that leaned around, it made no sense, combined with the obvious and frantic "Fear" that are as shocking as the PeeWee's Playhouse (which is at least fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, the smallest of whom is Alice Krige. When she goes on her shoulders and starts to act like a villain on the old Batman TV show, she is so absurd that she is bad. All the people who were in this area (including John Landis) are lucky to have a career. But the pointless part must be cat's costumes to the end that look like cheap rubber clothes that someone bought at K-Mart. The best part of the film is the look of some real cats who really perform in the movie.
