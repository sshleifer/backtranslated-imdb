I read reviews for this and if you do not expect a private private Ryan, I was expecting a movie of some substance. The film starts very lob-sided with the usual introduction of history and how the unit came to being. But right now it's 1944 and you're not sure where they are all. Accents, etc. They are very bad because this unit is to be Hawaiian / Asian America but they all speak in a very bad way on the Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person. I gave the film 3 out of 10 because after 10 minutes I could not watch. The figures were dimensional and although they were most likely based on real people for which I did not feel and it left me with no interest in them. The very bad direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on a cable channel. I avoided and tried to make more effort. It's a good story, but I deserved a better reputation. You feel the director saw a band of brothers and he thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch a group of brothers, Tuskegee's Flyers, Glory, or any other movie as if the streams faded ...
