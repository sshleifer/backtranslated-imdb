As a player, I can not say I like this movie. The fact is, I hated it right. I tried to watch her as closely as possible, but when it comes to it, it is quite insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> There are several reasons for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I met a lot of players, all different social strata. I do not know someone who acts as one of the characters in the movie. It is like filmmakers taking the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and putting them in five people. Most players are more social, some have an active life. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The Mokkumentary style is poorly adapted to the subject of the film. A real player document would actually work better. Although it is good looking (I.E. purely assembled), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It seems like any real world is missing. Players swear, I admit it, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is missing. While suicidal humor is the basis of my group and several other groups I've met, it's less self-deceiving and much like toiletry humor. Likewise, much of the player's humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not humor. Most players would avoid and avoid anyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: Precision. I do not mean rules but dynamics. This film will always be compared to even the lower prices of The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which represent players as real people who play in a real game. The Difference, Gamers: The film is a situation where you want to beat the gamblers against The Gamers where you can say something like, "Huh, I know that guy ... Yeah, that's definitely like Gary."
