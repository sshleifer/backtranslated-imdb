Look, I loved PROPER Anchorman, but that was really bad. What kind of wrongdoing will make you come back to your life, which is bad that thinks about "what on Earth thought the movie first", the kind of evil that brings you if you entered the kitchen to be they made refreshments during the movie, it would be another 50 minutes, causing the leprosy to look funny, which is bad that you think you want to hire Pauly Shore instead ... Seriously, I can not explain how it was bad. <br /> <br /> When I said that ... there were some semi-fun laughs, but they are all a lot less fun than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the whole subplot left of Anchorman that was there was really omitted for good reason ... it was not that good either. <br /> <br /> Take a favor (or in the US, kindness) and do not look at this DVD ... it will destroy the good movie that Anchorman is and you do not want to do. > <br /> Well ... I'm fine.
