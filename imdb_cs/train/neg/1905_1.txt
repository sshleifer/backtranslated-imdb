I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comics and probably reviewed more of Buster Keaton's IMDb movies than any other person. Every film he shot from the beginning of his career until the beginning of the 1930s, with two exceptions, I looked, so you can say I'm a big fan. For this reason, I found this episode so painful and difficult. I loved the movies of this man and I thought about it "Buster, how could you?" Well, now that I think about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton played this painful episode of REDUCED ZONE. He lost much of his wealth after a disordered divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a front man was also long gone. Now in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and loved his recovery in popularity, so he slipped over to everyone who was willing to pay - appearing in film plans and this mess of a big series episode. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with an episode is that it's just terribly written and Buster deserves much better. The show should be funny, but it's not just a respect for silent movies - especially with Keaton introducing the silly helmet helmet as well as all the badly executed thickets. Make a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation size once Keaton's career!
