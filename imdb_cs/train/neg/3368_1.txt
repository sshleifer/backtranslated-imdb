For movie fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and never seen Robert Wise's production in 1963 with Julie Harris, this remake will look pretty bad. For those of us who have it, it's just terrible. Bad Performance (What Do We Think of Neeson?), Improved Computer Enhancement, and another deviation from Jackson's story about this remake. <Br /> <br /> Take a favor and rent an original movie. Still effectively scares without hockey special effects. The game is professional and trustworthy. For the reader of the book, 1963 follows much closer.
