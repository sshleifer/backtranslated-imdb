First, I must admit that the Batman: Animated Series is the best batman series. We saw it when it was on TV. I did not realize there was a fourth season. It was not. BTAS ends with season 3, and should be stopped there. Why they had to have a good time. Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. Joker looks scary, it seems that every time he adjusts his look, he looks more and more. He does not seem to have pupils anymore, and now he does not even look distantly to the human (though it is). Bruce Wayne is spoken by Kevin Conroy, who does the best batman. Even now he looks like a superman. There is nothing to separate him because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. The night wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred only has pupils out of sight, looks more like a character from the eighties. I was looking at three episodes of disk 1 in the series and I've found that this version is more violent and graphic (there's blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: Animated Series, there is no season for 4 batman. It was this series that included Season 4 for merchantability. If they just released it as an adventure of a new batman, I do not think it would buy so many people. <br /> <br /> Save your disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3.
