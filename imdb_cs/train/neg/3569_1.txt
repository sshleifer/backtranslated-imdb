Wow! Only a movie that is so terribly horrible could cause similar "Showgirls". I think where to start? An insuperably horrible thematic song? Pia Zador's insignificance in the whole movie? The fact that, even though he is in Los Angeles, aka "the land of the cast-off couch", every man (and woman!) Sleeps with each other to sleep with Pius Zadoras by any means necessary? Or what is the fact that every person in the movie is totally indecent because they are either stupid (Pia) or apparently scorn (everyone else)? And because this film was written by a really "screenwriter" (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of film-making industry (who Hell would admire and kiss on SCREENWRITER?) But that's (unintentionally ) Funny, how the hell. "Scene" scene itself will giggle you, and after looking at the climatic "I'm not the only one who has had to go </a> to her top-level" scene on "The awards" (all in the usual bargain basement that we expect from such high-quality actors as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia has really re-used this speech when he "won" his Golden Globe, do your day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you are a fan of the bad, tashy camp, do this otherwise unpleasant movie.
