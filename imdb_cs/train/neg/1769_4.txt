1st observation 4./29/2007 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Camping vampire Stephen King movie has so many strange and volatile elements that you start laughing at the extreme strangeness of about three-quarters of a trip to the movie and wondering if you are, if this movie can have fans of the king. It's a story about mother and son who are sleepwalkers who move from city to town, looking for virgins to feed themselves to stay alive. They appear as normal upper class men, except for secret lovers and cats hanging around their house, day and night. Cats are lethal to them, so they have traps in their yard to try to keep the population. We see them breaking a couple of neck when they attack (which is also the first of my movie experiences) - I hope that no real cat has been damaged when filming the movie. The boy is after the sweet girl he is thrilled to until he becomes "sleeping" and then only wants her body. There are so many films unique to this film that it could be better if it was a full-day satirical comedy in suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every few minutes until you want to just get him and get the gore . Eventually it will happen and the film returns to the typical final step of Stephen King. The movie is interesting because the king's humor comes more than usual, but its peculiarity is also very present, and what you have is a movie that fans will probably like and have in their collection but as a valuable film experience it's really not a cut .
