This movie was so badly written, directed, and acted that it joked through faith. It should be done with a better script, director and casting. The worst problem is acting. On the one hand, you have Jennifer Beals, who is polished, professional and absolutely trustworthy, and Ri'chard, on the other hand, is pitifully indignant in this particular piece of work. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are simply terrible because slaves own (and keep) a pair, although both normally do a good job. Actors (and director) should not be trying to do at all - they are inconsistent and incredible. It is much better to concentrate on good work in English. Casting is ridiculous. Why do the children of the "African" merchant (less socially desirable for the Gens de Couleur society) have very pale skin actors, while the allegedly socially desirable Marcel has distinctive African features, including an apparently blonde blonde? It is as if casting directors could not bother to read the script they cast, and to select suitable actors from a large number of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's so strange! It could be a great movie and it should be done again, but with people who respect the material and can choose suitable and qualified actors. There are plenty of good actors and it would be fun to see Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata, and Gloria Reuben do their best with a decent cast, good script and decent direction.
