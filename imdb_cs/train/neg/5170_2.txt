Wow, it could be such a good movie, starting with Brittany Daniels bound, Im thinking we'll have a flash back but nothing, the movie starts again with the filming of a baby. This movie would probably be better if it was not about acting. I think acting was mostly horrible. Although with the lines with which the poor actors had to deal, I think they were doing the best they could. Still it really destroyed me. The twins were the only one, some acting skills .. The film stretches to long for the supposed shocking conclusion .. In all I saw worse low budget movies but given the hype with 8 films to die because I was very disappointed .. By the way, some reviewers said it was a gore and so. I saw the same movie ... Well, this is four out of eight and only one was good.
