Bloodsucker is leading a dance - that's a ridiculous title, so totally misleading. No wonder the filmmakers are trying and introducing us because it's a terrible movie. The story basically involves the mystery of murder in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> There is very little going on in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupor, it is always an unintentional comedy in the form of a terrible dialogue that is presented by a hopeless group of vocal artists. These guys are so bad they're making actor who gives voices to appear as a group of madmen on the way. It's really hard to determine how bad acting is when you're dubbing this incredible. But voice artists can not be blamed for scripts. It's a travesty. Inadvertently the best funny, in the worst case pathetic. The story generally is, at least, unequal. Female characters are particularly idiotic; men are either scary or boring. The whole society is trying to clean the audience. It does not do what it promises, and even when the murders (finally) begin to do, they are all out of the screen. All we get is a couple of elusive cut heads. Several people said that this film is giallo. I can not agree with this opinion. Anyone who likes Italian thrillers should give this film a wide berth because there is nothing exciting about it. It is basically a pornographic film of a soft core with a horror angle. But it's not too erotic. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it to anyone.
