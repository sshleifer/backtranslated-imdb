PROM NIGHT (2008) Director: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Cast: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) the death of her entire family in the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who crushed her a little. Now he is preparing for his senior ball with his silly annoying friends. Once there, they die one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because her ball was obviously too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> For: I have some good laughs from the movie due to the terrible dialogue and the stupid character moves. Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone will decide Donnai will not say that the man who is obsessed with her (he does not look so great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They do not want to question her in front of all their friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of slasher. Usually I can have fun with the bad ones. I even like some horror films PG-13. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a deep slasher film that is rated PG-13 has nothing to do with the fact that I do not like the movie. <br /> <br /> At first I had a big problem with the story. I like Slasher movies that do not even have stories. At least they can be fun. She is a teacher who falls in love with her student, so she kills her whole family. A few years later, he will try to say goodbye to him by destroying the ball and killing all his friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt if someone cared about them. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights with her boyfriend, has cramps and can not care for her. It was Lifetime, not remake PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... it's a movie with a deadly deadly movie. Nor do I care that it's not such a throat that some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not so shameful, but they still had effective murder. Here we have half the characters dying in the same room outside the screen, the woman was stabbed several times without stab wounds and a close look at the face of a bad actor when she screamed in agony. I'm sure ten-year-old girls were terrified, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. It was Donna's unrealistic girlfriend, Bobby (Scott Porter), and I can almost guarantee you never meet a friend who's sensitive in your life if you're not a homosexual. Then we had Donny's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis) and the token means Chris's girl (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were uncomfortable, try watching this movie. And do not let me start with Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me memories of Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add a predictable conspiracy, soundtrack and a great lack of respect to the original material and you have a lot of killing.
