I do not think I ever felt that I had dropped it before. After I loved two previous movies by Guy Ritchie (I do not count Swept Away - I was a pussy blind), so I was looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The rating was bad, then again, I do not believe the press. More disturbing is the fact that the internet buzz was that it was a little bit stingy, so I gave a little anxiety to my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not try to explain this movie mainly because I have no idea what is going on, and at one point I was sincerely honored to stand up and ask if it was just me who it did not get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have gotten into his wife's trap to get too seriously. It seems that it was not good for him to make films with good drawings, laughs, signs. It's almost as if he had a checklist of the films he wanted to tear off, here are some of the things I noticed: Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, common suspect, Vanilla Sky ... I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of two major actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were really good and it was a really self-styled story and editing / direction that left the film down. <br /> <br /> So big, big thumb from me.
