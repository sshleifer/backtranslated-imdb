In fact, it has never been. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate the comedy of the 1960s. What annoying shiver! None of these people are approaching Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc. And today's audience is not as sensitive to this lightness. Writing is trivial. Hackneyed fence is a sharp girl and obvious. There is no chemistry between the leading characters. Interestingly, Julia Roberts thinks it's a reincarnation of some great stars from the "Golden Age of Hollywood," whenever it may be. It's an effect that tries and can not reach again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
