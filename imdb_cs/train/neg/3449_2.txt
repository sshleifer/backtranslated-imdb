It is merciful that there is no video about this hopeless western that would have been for Big Frank at the time of his career. The story of a las who lives on the reputation of his brother from a large weapon and who drove out of the town the bad guys to return to the gathering with the cities with the new found courage had to write a writer. Overall, this show is smelly. The story is basically boring, poorly conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to deviate completely from the second reviewer who considered it "... underestimated ..." Critics at that time struck and deserved it. You'll have to catch him at the last show if you're late and you'll have a lot of insomnia. But if you can sit down, you have more power than most of my movie friends.
