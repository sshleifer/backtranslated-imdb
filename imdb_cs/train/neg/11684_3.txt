This film makes no sense at all, there are conspicuous holes that are large enough to drive enormous NYPD vehicles. Characters do not act in any way. I'll put my comments on the chat, but you'll save time and money, it's stupid. I can not stand up when Hollywood spends millions of dollars for flash bang equipment and uses fantastic editing and great music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together on the most basic level. But it is nice to see that Denzel W. prevails over a man who has three flavors: Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain von Trapp. There's a sweet kid with a video game that's pretty.
