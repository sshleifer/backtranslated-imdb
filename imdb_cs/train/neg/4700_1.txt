I totally hated the movie. It was so slow. They need some acting lessons ... no, wait, it will not help because Naked Brothers Band slows down. Do you know why I'm here, even though I'm a naked crazy fool? Warn people before looking at the silly film so that NBB does not get any money from him so they can not make other amateur silly songs that are so late that an old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only that song lyrics slow down, they sing badly. Okay, I got a little out of the movie ... anyway, it was boring and it worked terribly. It was not funny at all, even though they really tried to make it. I think he deserves some credit for it ... well, the film is not worth your time. Just take a look at his rating. The film (and the series) is very painful when we look at anyone who has even half the brain. Seriously, if you like it, you have to watch movies where the actors actually act, do not fool their lines in monotonous. I'm in a dramatic club in my school and some people are really better than those who are Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I really thought Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this poopie. I do not even know why I went through the movie. I do not think he deserves to be called a movie ...
