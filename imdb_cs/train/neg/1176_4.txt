Revolutions are always opportunities for dramatic movies, as most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated by excess boredom. One does not care about who wins, loses, dies or lives - it's enough to quit as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. The scenes of Paris and French landscapes have cardboard quality. It could be better off on the bare stage and let it go. The dazzling effects of "House of Flying Daggers" or "Golden Compass" can not be expected, but it is digitally mastered production in 2002. It seems that the characters enter the scene due to the entry into the scene by losing the number of times the character will enter and leave the room. In my opinion, this film transforms the French Revolution of 1790 into a "papier-mache" revolution in the world of "paper collectors".
