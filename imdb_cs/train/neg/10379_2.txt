The film begins in 1840 in Japan, where one breaks his wife and her mistress to death and suicides. It's a very bloody sequence. Then it jumps to today ... and 1982 to be accurate. Ted (Edward Albert), Laura's wife (Susan George) and their annoying little child moved to Japan for a tough job. Rent a house a - surprise! Surprise - it's just the house where the murders took place! Three dead people are like ghosts (makeup is hysterically bad) and they make hell for the family. <br /> <br /> It sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending and NEVER happens to be in between. There is a giant crab attack that is just honest! They look so fake - I swear I saw strings stretching out in a row - and mumble !!!!! In the first 20 minutes there is an absurd sexual sequence (probably just showing George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but it was necessary for the conspiracy) and really stupid exorcism to the end. The battle scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be considered credible. As for acting - Albert was fine because the husband and McClure were quite good as a family friend. But George - as always - is amazing in a miserable movie. It gives this movie the necessary elevator - but it can not save it. I only give 2 for her and for opening and closing. This is a very boring film.
