The only reason I did not do it is that Sibrel proves he is well versed in the technical aspects of shooting a movie. It's a technically competent film. Once said, it is a film based on lies and deformations that are quite easily eliminated. Most of the document is exhausted using propagandist techniques to consist of a cosmic program, rather than actually. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that the landings were counterfeit can easily be dispelled if you know anything about orbital mechanics. I do not recommend watching, but if so, check out google video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity.
