I have heard about this novel long ago, many of my friends have recommended me to read it. I searched for it everywhere, and eventually I found it. It's a book everyone should read because it's genius and his vision. I really liked each page. I knew about the movie and could not wait to see her. When I finally did that I was very disappointed, the many things that are in the book are not in the movie (I do not think it's a spoiler) that just makes the film not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but bad writer. Especially like a bookie. The film is not at all dark, writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I've seen myself as Winston Smith. What annoys me most are people in IMDb who said "The best adaptations ever" without reading a book! Or know something about writing on the screen! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brilliant story by reading the book, do not consider it an alternative. As a fan of the book I was very disappointed. The points I've made for this film are for acting.
