This movie is really bad, with a script full of "memorable" lines and incredibly poor performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to them to believe it. Only two short themes (about 30 seconds) are repeated throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
