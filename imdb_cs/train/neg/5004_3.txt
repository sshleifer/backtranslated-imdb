Wow it's ironic because this movie was for a while I think someone else JUST reviewed it a few days ago. Anyway, I watched this movie simply because Nick Stahl had a record. br /> <br /> The film was ridiculous. The characters brought me INSANE, it was SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had the worst dialogue I've ever heard. It was too much plot conspiracy too. There is one scene in the movie worth seeing, however, the scene: "Warm Heart, a Cold Gun" where Nick Stahl kills an unpleasant girl in the shower. (Well, in fact, everyone was uncomfortable.) But his acting in the scene was excellent. The look on his face resembled my American Psycho (good movie). The scene is worth seeing, but it is not worth seeing the rest of the film, do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
