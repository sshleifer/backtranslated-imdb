My words fail. This movie was extremely difficult to watch and I really wished I did not do it. Although I tried to sit until the end of the loans I must admit that I could not last for more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. This film, however, will require the most remarkable final third in the history of filmmaking to be awarded a revision that is nothing but sinister. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch any part of this movie.
