I just watched it. Some laugh, but nothing to write about. Jason Lee looked as if he was having fun. (Long) DVD gag consists almost exclusively of having an uncontrollable laugh. Selma Blair seemed to be doing the lesson, but then her character had to be in the mud, so it's "well done"? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles's father (merry) in 10 Things I Hate About You is also funny. It's great, but the best aspect of this movie was casting Julie Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her folding clothes and feeling like I did.
