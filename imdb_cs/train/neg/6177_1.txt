The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top comic, in other situations from Stooges. He had some success because he was very entertaining and smart. Moe, Larry, and Shemp have really met him, or at least for many years, and he liked his work. So what's happening on Earth when he joined the unit as a "third hundred"? Of course nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" shorts, more often than not, the boys are opposed to each other or Joe against the other two, and that's not exactly the Stooge label. "One for Everyone, Everything for One, Everyone for Myself", quoting Curly from "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how everyone tries to use each other or slap when the chips are really down, comes to help the other. In this particular case nothing will happen. It's almost like watching a dog fight when you try to cheat others or be bad and unpleasant and not for a comedic effect. One could assume that there is something going on behind the scenes, art imitating life. Perhaps it is because Besser has not stayed long with Moe and Larry. Check out the history of other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
