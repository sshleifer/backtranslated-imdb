Matt Cordell is back from the dead for the third round, although I'm not sure anyone cared about him, except for the MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected by voodoo and is now hot on the trail of a few dirty people who are involved in shooting a colleague whom Cordell loves very much. I missed part of this early nineties with a low budget, but it was nice to see Cordell smash the body in various, threatening ways. The problem is that the overall movie is quite static and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. The interest is very fast, even due to the fact that the great physician B-film Robert Forster as a doctor who finished with the brain was mixing. Keep the first movie in the series, which is fun and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
