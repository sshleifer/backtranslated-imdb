The film has risen over the past few years with an army that has set up an electronic tracking facility in the desert where attacks have been made in the first film. The crew is killed before a group of soldiers appear on training to find nobody around. You can fill the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a payout picture all around. There seems to be no passion in any performance, no one behind the camera. This is a film that was made for money and nothing else. At a certain level, it should work, it could be even more menacing southern comforts (where national guards run around some people in the marshes), but instead it does not do much. For the most part, you can blame the script, written incredibly in part by Wes Craven, who has repeatedly encountered the same old goals. Add to the clutter the fact that the direction is dull and the sequence setting is so lacking in gloss to remove any of your own tensions in any scene. Its not as bad as it is, but badly made and boring. Let me put my feelings in context: The reason I saw this movie was that the local multiplex took over and launched this film instead of children's films on Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused screaming (I think movies have so much common - he says sarcastically). I'm convinced that this movie will scare only those who like the last Mimzy.
