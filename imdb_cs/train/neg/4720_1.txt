When I saw this document, I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda again in action. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the breakup in Yugoslavia, Bogdanovic, whose name tells us he is Serbian and his film, is not far from objective in this "documentary" document. This is one of a series of lying practices enforced by the Milosevic regime. Everyone else is guilty of the Serbs being right and sacrifices, although most military criminals have tried to be Serbs in The Hague, although Serbs are the one who committed genocide against Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all independent nations, UNBreakup of Yugoslavia was not excluded, because the Serbs did not want to release the adherence that nationalism introduced to the federal Yugoslav government, so that Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent states in order to protect their interests. are interested in an objective documentary about the breakup of Yugoslavia and the fact led the documentary. You should watch "Yugoslavia: The Death of a Nation," made by the Discovery Channel and the BBC.
