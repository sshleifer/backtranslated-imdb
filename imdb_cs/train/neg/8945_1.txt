I have to admit that there are several books with the corresponding films that I actually read before I saw a film adaptation. Nineteen and eighty-four have become one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was a fascinating and interesting prophecy. But the movie is just soaked up. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not shut down after the first five minutes was the fact that watching the film was half the two-part job for the class. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to get the right atmosphere. The effects were not above average, and because there was not much to do, it was a real disappointment. For example, the book did not seem to me that Winston was able to refute more than just one syllable at a time. Dull, disturbing, and visually uninteresting, the film totally cannibalized the book. Wait a minute ... Is not this the British?
