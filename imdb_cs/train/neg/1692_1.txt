Well, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. He's trying to be frightening just because he's working poorly with the camera and loud sounds, but he's unlucky to fail. For example, if you say so, it is weak and rather full of holes, how could it have a consciousness care center that Yoko did not show up for work when there were not people who lived in the house? And it is not entirely clear what Bill Pullman has in common. He just got out of nothing to hand over the conspiracy. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the room, little boy or dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when a boy found her in the care center? There were too many unanswered questions, and I was too bored to think about it more.
