At first, I thought he was naughty about credit documents saying that the story and script was made by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood scriptwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was basically based on the story of Robert Louis Stevenson "The Bot Imp". A good person gets into possession of a bad object that gives him any wish, but eventually he turns him into hell. It's alright. Nobody said that scriptwriters had to be original. Actors are generally very competent due to the average writing that they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero thinks he has discovered the way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in some other way in order to save an innocent man. It seemed to work first, but it was true for the modern horror film code, he feels he must give one last horror at the end of the film. This is a stupid convention. Older horror films have gone well and have enabled the hero to win at the end. There is nothing wrong with the fact that good triumphs over evil, no matter how it seems that the current creators think. You can give the audience a good, healthy fear and yet feel happy at the end. In fact, I think it's better.
