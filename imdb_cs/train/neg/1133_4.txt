I've seen romantic comedies and it's one of the simplest / worst attempts in one. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play way that strictly adapts to the romantic comedy genre. It's usually okay because we're dealing with the genre, but the challenge generally is that it's original, new and inventive. This movie does not do that. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of who they really are, except for Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of the movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√© and become nothing but simple puppets that serve the purpose of a very light narration. Film stimulation may be unpleasant, the rhythm lacks, and editing is filled with unnecessary details. I should also mention overly stylized decors that make some scenes that they lack naturally, or rather, that the attempt naturally seems too obvious. Of course, along with that, you have real-to-cue sappy music, which unfortunately often sounds bad. I can not believe that a movie that makes a distinct Woody Allen disruption ends up being this fraudulent. If you expect a good, romantic comedy, it's not like that. Or rather, this bad attempt to do so. You leave the theater just because you wonder why this movie has received such praise when the cinema has been for over 100 years and there are far better Quebecois directors doing better moves. Les Aimants is a good movie what it is. But it is bad if you consider cinema as art and directors as an author.
