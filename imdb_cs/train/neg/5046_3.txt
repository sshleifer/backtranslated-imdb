The lethargic direction will spoil the otherwise compelling historical story that Zhang Ziyi's astonishing marvel as a woman joining an extremist group in 1928 in China just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and reunited with a former lover who is now working for Japan . Every dramatic and forward-looking story is exhausted by director Ye Lou's directing style. The characters are still looking at each other for long minutes, they do not say, handhelds hold forever on the faces, which show endless reactions longer than they need, edits repeat that the same response is triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters, because the story begins and there is little new information as the story goes, only silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, who intertwine with silent dances but do not share any obvious emotional intimacy. Very sleeping film.
