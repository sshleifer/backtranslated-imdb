A certain, inexpensive sci-fi thriller, made with almost complete lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from space, controlled by only one person and is very poorly guarded at night) and full of sound effect. Christopher Lee is not just useless, but he also gives one of his several "executive performances". (* 1/2)
