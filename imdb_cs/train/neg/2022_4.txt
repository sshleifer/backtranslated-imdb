Man, this is a lot of good reviews in review books. Frankly, I found that it was too slow and inapplicable from the beginning. I waited for a while to pick up a little steam, but it never happened. This movie is extremely overvalued. Shakespeare, with King James English, never liked me so it could be just me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film, as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello. The good points of the film are - thanks to the restored press - some decent cinematography and the young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's just too boring, too many repetitions in some scenes to watch again. Besides, we all know that most actors are nuts, but Hollywood, that they prove it in this story.
