If you've seen previous movies and Rodney Dangerfield's performances, you'll recognize a few jokes that are made in this particular piece. Written as a sitcom, this film can not come up with any kind of chord, from the self-confessed doctor who plays Sexy Silky Silky Molly Shannon on "I Am Fatty and therefore Witty" by John Linette. The 5 women themselves are pretty characters and if it was done as a pilot for action adventure, it could work. Instead, it looks like a man's fantasy that hardly strives not to be politically wrong.
