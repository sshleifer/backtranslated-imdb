I saw some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Who Shagged Me, Batman forever), but this movie is so awful so BORING that I got about half way and could not bear to watch the rest. Damage. With talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall, and the story by John Grisham, what happened? Branagh is a long time attorney who has one night with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung his cat, etc., so Branagh sent him to the walnut and immediately escaped. Somehow (I could not figure out how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed in a story that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like it and as a big fan of Grisham I read the whole movie and I (stupidly) expected something interesting. This is frankly the best movie I've ever seen and I wish I could get the money back. * outside *****.
