drss1942 really took my words from my mouth. I loved Segala's early films and I felt the only one who was still faithful to him. I just saw this movie (ok, fell about 90% so I did not see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on a DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not do any of the other of the movie and dared not find out what happened at the end. There was something weird about Segal's voice and others. Something reminded me of the original Mad Max, where the voice was dubbed, but in the same language (Australian is English, right?) Anyway, if I had 10 inches, everyone would now be alerted to this injustice.
