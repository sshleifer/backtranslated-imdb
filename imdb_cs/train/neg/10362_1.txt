Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie was set in the 1960s, like the book. And I really could deal with cheap special effects to save the budget for more accurate adaptation ... I'm glad maybe someone might be influenced to read books ..... but the Red-Eyed Man Interchangeable as IT? And what's happening with volcanic shock? Where was the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Already (1978) I have heard that the European version of this film exists. I'm sure I could do it. I can only imagine that this may be closer to a real story than this bad adaptation. This movie must be X'd.
