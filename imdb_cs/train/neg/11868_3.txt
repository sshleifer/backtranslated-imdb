At first glance, this film has everything psycho wants: a true story with a "no under 18" restriction, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatic fanatics, and even homosexual cop! But this film is the result of a bad story (so thin), bad acting - with an absurd English accent that will make you believe you're looking at the bad Monty Python -, bad music (80th hard rock), video tapes are horrible, the end is real shame ... Plus sex scenes are ridiculous, gore is not very impressive. And those vampires are reflected in the mirror and are not afraid of daylight! You will be very disappointed if you do not see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust one day gets to bottom 100 because that's his real place. I think it might be fun to watch if you have friends and a lot of beer. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
