Guy, what a crazy thing this mess was. But it takes only an hour and I only paid for living for ... unlike the whole cast of this cluster of 1933, which is now all dust. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a small village begins to have bodies that are rotating that have been exhausted from all the blood. Local yokels will start talking about vampires, of course, and a little louder than any body. The City Sheriff or Watchman or what it is, starring a wonderful actor Melvyn Douglas, will try to tell them differently. When he mentions that the dead have one big hole on each side of the neck, instead of two holes nearby, local people simply say, a huge vampire bat. The constable insists that vampires do not exist, and it must be the human culprit that makes killing. But Melvyn does not seem to worry too much either. to get in the pants of his darling, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix, the city is simple, played by Dwight Frye, it seemed that all the roles played the same role in all the movies he did. Other residents were terrified by catching bats and drinking their own blood. Lionel Atwill plays an urban doctor who apparently tries to help the constable solve the crimes. he sometimes smells like herec.Atwill is so close to the cardboard in this role as he could get.And Lionel Barrymore is also on this stuff .... lots of big names are so pile of guano. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ For me the high point of the film is looking at Frye, he's a strange stranger's nails strange, but other than he did not offer this movie much. And then when you find a reason for weird death and see a special effect thing that required all of these blood "It will really be let go." Bela Lugosi did a lot of terrible pictures, but at least he was fun and interesting from this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you will feel how desperately bad this mess was. If you can not make a good horror film from 1930 at least give Lugosi it.
