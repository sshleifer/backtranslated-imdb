I chased this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ... but the first problem was that it was not really a story ... or actually it was a story it made no sense. The second problem was that these characters were not set ... yes, I think everyone went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized they had nothing in common and did not like each other ... so why are they still meeting . Error number 3 ... the director, although long pauses and close shots from the camera even matched the tension (especially with the typical thrilling music dubbed in) ... he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch an amazing actress like the time spent by Amber Benson trying to restore life ... My only hope is that the money she made here was focused on producing her own film.
