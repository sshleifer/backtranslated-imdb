You have to look at this show once to see them, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim is doing something so good, but he upsets his wife, at the end he finds out what he did is really for her, she caresses his face and smiles as she looks at her hesitantly. In fact, the stories are so feeble and formal that I will have a sting on one now. Episode "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jim's wife notices that all of Jim's wages have disappeared a week, then explaining to her that he has lost at the casino. He shouts and leaves the house, how he feels horrible. Then, on a Valentine's Day, he appears in a limousine with ball tickets (and explains the missing wages). She realizes her "mistake" and the usual "Oh Jim, you are so nice". Ending Another very obvious point is that the character of Jims is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can get away with being fighting and unconscious when he tries with human beings that does not work and Jim just comes an arrogant, self-confident asshole. <br /> <br /> IMO's only reason why it's successful is simply because we are now so much of a human being with TVs that you can now imagine the idea of ​​a man who isolates the walls and you get the audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other side is fantastic and cheerful.
