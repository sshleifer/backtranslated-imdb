Power Rangers is definitely the worst TV show and a totally ridiculous plastic toy in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing, or distantly entertaining about this terrible TV show. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with horrific actors who dress in colorful spandex suits that look absolutely ridiculous. The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, no redemption of this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Children of today should try to watch better shows such as Toy Story movies instead of these garbage.
