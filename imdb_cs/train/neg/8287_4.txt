This is a very television version of the story, the film begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with a small meaningful description of dialogue or character. After some time it becomes a bit more substantial, but all the characters are still cartoon. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is evil and sexually suppressed Frollo, he wanted to grab the walnut in Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> Its also a liberal version of the story, Frollo is suppressing the ideal of enlightenment, like Abbot in 'The Name of the Rose' and Quasimodo is the winner of freedom. The shadow side of the Quas is ignored, although it brings fluid to people. He is really just an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. Perhaps the film is designed for children, but I doubt that Frollo himself is crouching when he wants to grab his monkey. Mostly uninteresting and forgotten, but not terrible and sometimes fun, telling the story.
