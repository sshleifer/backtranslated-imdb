As a longtime fan of the Star Trek series, I found it a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of "memories" that Will Riker's use is both positive (and predominantly romantic) and negative (lots of pain and death of the crew) was a money-saving device, as well as many of their "showcases" (episodes in which all scenes take place in Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who has also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserves a finer look than her character. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) Also they were shortchanged. This was the last episode of the second season; the season ended "not with the bang", but with "the kiss".
