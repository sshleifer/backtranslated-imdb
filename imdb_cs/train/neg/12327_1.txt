The previous reviewer said the movie is not that bad. What?!?!?! The film celebrates child abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so we'll give her 5 out of 10 stars. Why not full 10? Since filmography was "agonizing," the child's shock was "unrealistic," and the fat friend was "irritated." Nowhere in the reviewer, he made no exaggeration that the American film in 1981 featured scenes of a child who had sex with an adult woman. It happened to me that I caught this hood of the film when I was at the hotel that had Showtime. For me, even if a fat friend was playing a storm and deserving an Oscar, I would have to give the film only one star. That TV, Howard Hessman, played in the movie at the same time as WKRP, is particularly ridiculous. But do not forget it!
