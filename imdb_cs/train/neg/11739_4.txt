Frequently Reliable Leonard Maltin says it's "beautiful romance" and that Sanders is "excellent". Maltin had to confuse this film with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and excellent as usual, ?? you can imagine delivering his line of adultery, "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so hard that they have to be carried by three," but boring, wooden and dated to describe this movie more accurately. The story itself, autobiography with Sanders as the famous jewelery thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes the police chief, but barely resists the love of fine jewels, is fun enough but has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood healing, such an epic period as Marie Antoinette *, and certainly pitiful * Forever Amber * (who screams for an elegant remake). Although Sanders is trying to add some depth to his character in his defense, it's all for nothing. I am an unfortunate fan of Douglas Sirk, but this is 1946 and it is one of the earliest American attempts Sirk, lacking many signatures that would define his florid, breasts potboilers. Sirk's been stitching his legs here, and for the next ten years he has made a number of undeniable films until he did gold with a * Great Oblivion * and struck his footsteps and bombed us with such estrogen celebrations as * All Heaven Allows *, * Written on the Wind * and * imitation of life *. But * Scandal in Paris * is hardly his best job? a relatively low budget with small sets and inefficient costume.
