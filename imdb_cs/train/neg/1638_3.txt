I look forward to seeing Amanda Peetova play another good role after renting The Whole Nine Yards recently - it's easy to hire, but it was not. that the trailer for the Whipped was somewhat funny and a plot of three surprised New Yorkers, twenty years old, all falling and manipulating the charming Mrs. Peet, that was worth it. So one afternoon I convinced two friends to get to know me about this movie. This review is my repentance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have three leading caps that tell about their conquests in the dining room. What was funny, or at least say, would be rather pathetic. Was there a redeemed quality of three men and their encounters that we should get out of it? <br /> <br /> [And if I do not mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, I wondered why nobody in the dining room turned when the stallions talked loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. Do they do it every week on the same dinner? Do you think anyone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: the other two guests will notice in one scene. But that's just setting for the punchline. Everyone else in the dining room is deaf.] The second law has all three hammers that fall on Mia and then develop brain mourning, neither require each other, nor do what is really going on between these four. And I still asked myself that the cubs still behave like the ones they see as the redemption of quality in them to keep them longer than once? Does it begin with brain rot? I long hoped that Eric's character, a married friend, would become something more than an annoying bag in this act. His task is to clear advice about getting married. But why bother to talk to him when they do not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third law solves what a plot is, but this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me that they are still waiting for something really fun and I have to agree. The scene that explains everything was reasonable and able to explain all questions and mysterious dialog bits throughout the movie, but we just checked them out of the list. ("Oh, well, that's why it happened Brad and Jonathan says it and ...") What we laugh at was a stupid conspiracy than something fun. Even the outputs during credits were not very fun. In the end, I left nothing but a desire to warn people about this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
