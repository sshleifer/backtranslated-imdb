After seeing the low-budget crazy version of "Universal Soldier," I was hoping and praying that Van Damme played his role as Luc Devoreaux in the second film Unisol. This prayer seemed to have been answered, but not as I had hoped. Universal Soldier 2 is just as intense as the poetry read in your local library. No, it would be even more interesting. Combat sequences are the top quality of Bruce Lee, the only redemption factor in all this miserable film justification. This and have a former WCW heavy-guy legend "Goldberg" playing a villain. However, placing Goldberg as Lieutenant Seth would be better. <br /> <br /> I was most offended by the setting of the film itself. It's like some film school students did it together. The story of the plot is all the bigger than the ego Kanye West is what really makes this film in. For example: Luc's daughter, Hillary appears to be at least 11-13 years old and the first film was shot just seven years ago. How is it possible? Say it to me! The part in which Luc's partner was killed and transformed into Unisol is unnecessarily crazy! You want to tell me that the experimental Unisol was naked in the underground of the research complex at the beginning of the film. Come on. The director was able to spend more time with this film first, and all the punches drove. But ooo nooo! <br /> <br /> Talk about the plot, IT SUCKS! Compared to the first filter, the Universal Soldier 2 earth site was destroyed and worthless. Where are the bizarre excitement Unisol goes to berserk, and will he recall his last memories in the supermarket when he thinks it's a desert storm or something? It was the dawn of the millennium, you would attract more audiences if it happened in a dystopia / orwellian type of future cesspool. Corny is the correct adjective describing this sad, sad, sad, sequel. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3 and hell, even the wardrobe / no Terminator class "Class of 1999" is more fun than this!
