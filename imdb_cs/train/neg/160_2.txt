I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane" all in this story! Add Gary Coopera as the lead actor and it sounds great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found out that I was looking at my watch for only 40 minutes into being bored. The character of Jean Arthur was somewhat annoying, and James Ellison simply did not look or resemble a "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was not even in his best shape, it sounded too wooden. It was several years before he hit his main actor. <br /> <br /> In short, his western shots. Go to the pass and watch the next one because most of them were much better than this one.
