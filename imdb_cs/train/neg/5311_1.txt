This is almost the worst movie you've ever seen! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling a carpet under this, for me. Aid is a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis". Space scenes seem to have been made in a power plant in the 1950s, just before demolition. Music is upset. This is wood and ham. The characters they display are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and hopelessly obvious when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of direction adores faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it just to experience what must be one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever. This is an invaluable example of a silly movie!
