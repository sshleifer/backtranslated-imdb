This show made me physically ill and completely separated from British society as a whole. There were programs like this and Blue Peter that pretended there were no class divisions in Britain. They always said things like; "Go to your attic and you can find it." Or "Go to today's garden and ..." - what working-class girls who never had "loft" and "" that was no more than 1 square meter of balcony on the 14th floor of the block? Public broadcasting - yeah right! Besides, it was terribly depressing to see those silly, middle classes, their own children doing their backs, with pieces of old plastic that have "fun" ... they make me a favor and "that" you go and cut your wrists or overdose coke for money "mothers and dads"
