I do not know why I realized that I read this waste film. If you stick with him long enough, in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising? No. After a perennial, formal, predictable dialogue and acting, he finally breaks out. The internal scenes are so brightly lit that you think that if the camera was zoomed one millimeter further, you will see the key lights. Costumes, hair and kits are starchy, molded and undamaged. Should we imagine that ordinary people really lived such as Arizona in the early 20th century? Other reviews of Sam Peckinpah are insulting to Peckinpah: At least the director has tormented his violence into the context of chaos and chaos. Gore HARD MEN is a free explosive toy made of wooden pretending villains with nail polish. Huh?!? I can believe Heston thought he could do something about this movie. (Captured the pistols in cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he signed up for this travesty. Do you want to see the movie about the end of the West, as we know it, the end of the West as we know them? Watch SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST HARD men are a ridiculous obituary for the West.
