From a visual point of view, this film is stunning. She has some wonderful black comic moments. But overall, the conspiracy is very clich√©, just like the seeming message. If you are a fan of supernatural violence in major movies such as a hostel or seen, you will love it. If you are looking for something extra, avoid. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06 and I chose it just because I was looking for something worrying. In the end, it is not disturbing. Just grind and unpleasant to sit. If you really want to be attacked, look at something like The Lost. If you want to be exhausted or tell your friends about a really dirty movie, then it's for you.
