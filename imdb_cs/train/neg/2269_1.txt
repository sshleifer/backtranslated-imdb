It allows you to make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically has everything that happened on the show! Well, if this idea does not deserve you, which should not be, stay out of the rings. I was dissatisfied with seeing it in the theater, and I was really able to sit in this mess of the movie. I think jerry springer is not playing alone, as shown by the cheap props for his show (so it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he's just known as the jerry in the movie. The story (if you say it) is about a daughter while living with her mother, she decides to start sleeping with her mother lived in a friend. So the great idea of ​​a mother is to call jarry spring show as well as get it with her daughter's friend. (It's a coincidence that they live in an outboard park). Meanwhile, somewhere else in America, she finds a woman with her boyfriend in bed. So, of course, call Jerry's American therapist! I would talk about the rest of the film, but I'm thinking about the film now. Jamie Pressly, who plays a daughter, looks absolutely uninteresting in the movie. And do not forget Michael Dudikoff that the cartoon from the American Ninja series will happen? Well look at it like white prey. The point is that he really looks too horrible and informal to call "contact with his clue". But if your idea of ​​fun sees Jerry Springer singing a village song about his own show or guys who are joining the transvestits ... well ... just just watch out for the whistle! ... At least Steve was smart enough to stay out of this movie.
