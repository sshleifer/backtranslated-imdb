romance without feeling, drama without problems (or drama) .... This movie is supposed to be everything and it fails on every account as if it did not try. Or as if the director / editor / screenwriter team did not really try. Actors are able - they need better support. One item that does not disappoint is George Delarue's score. Beautiful and moving. What disgrace is attached to this film. In a good movie actors and words moves and music to synchronize and enhance the impact. This editor focused on music, regardless of dialogue and movement. Love is particularly cruel in this respect: an insult to the talents of leading actors. <br /> <br /> There are also other films in the movie: movie location. Especially one moment at Grand Central Station. I made a preliminary realization of what would happen; but how it was shot in this environment was amazing. Some commentators on this record have pointed out that American assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists has actually become over these years of fear from MacCarthy. The moment the movie begins to look for a serious American society, it switches to conventional romance; Before any human feelings can move us, it's off to a (predictable) "thriller." <br /> <br /> Just as the film offends the actors' talents, it offends the problems they pretend (and fails) to accept. <br /> <br /> You are warned.
