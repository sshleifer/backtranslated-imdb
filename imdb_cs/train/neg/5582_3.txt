The 60s was a period of change and awakening for most people. Social shocks and unrest were common when people were expressing their opinions. Race tension, politics, Vietnam war, sexual promiscuity and drug use were part of the daily structure and daily news. This film attempted to embrace these historical aspects into the entertainment film and to a large extent succeeded. There are two families in this movie: one white and one black. During the first half of the story, the story follows each family on an equal footing through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the other half of the film is almost devoted to the white family. It is true that in this family there are more characters and stories are changing, but equal considerations are not devoted to the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good and historical shot mixed with color and black-and-white original shots that give the movie a perfect feel. The film is a fictitious piece of work, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to determine the time line. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie but the situation was predictable and the story was one-sided.
