STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Long prisoner Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to a tougher prison than reopened Alcatraz. He claims to be closer to his lady, but his real motives are a little more grandiose. He goes through the paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg), who can take care of himself. Twitch, though less muscular, is the same mouth and is quite the same. But between black and Hispanic prisoners who explode into hostile takeover, a gang war is triggered when a black gang leader is shot dead and a finger on Burke. But sh! T really hits a fan when Cortez (Robert Madrid), a real killer and leader of Hispanics, takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter as a hostage. Steven Seagal does not do a sequel (supposedly very unlike Under Siege 2 and only agreed to do so on condition that the film company he was in at that time let his own film shoot), despite the fact that it was a sequel to DVD, the main role in this round is Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some films from the first movie that is coming to an end.) But there is a reason why he did not do a lot of work from the soldier 2 because he is not much actor and not much of the action star, nor is he driving a character that begins as very dark and indignant, but hopelessly turns into a standard action hero to run awkwardly from the dull one-liners. The support of wise veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, jumped to the extra work. This is a movie that tried to copy the original style quite well. dim light, dark shadows and rap music. He does it well overall, unfortunately he can not cope with an indestructible hero, an equally cartoon villain, and an unfavorable story that the creators seemed to have succeeded in. **
