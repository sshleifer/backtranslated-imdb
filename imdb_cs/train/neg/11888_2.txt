If you want to make a movie about the supposed end of the world, you should have some facts and realism 1. We never tell you why people believe it. 2. Location is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. PLEASE LIKE YOU ARE YOU THINKING MY THINGS WHY IT WILL FALL IN MINIMITY AND WHY (IN THE BAGS) WERE WORKING WITH SEPTEMBER 3. Acting was in this neo-a-natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual stories were totally sad and without any purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to make it as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> rating 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB <br /> <br /> thanks I am as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSMAN
