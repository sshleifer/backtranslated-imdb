I have never been a big fan of Taiwanese film production, unlike Korean, Hong Kong or even China. Strong actor's quality is barely in them, as is clearly seen in this film. I do not consider myself a viewer because I am in fact a fan of Indian films. However, this film shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I found out that I was down in the middle of the plot. Arranging certainly does not improve. Rainie's acting is subgroup because she "exaggerated", trying to be infatuated and cute. Although I have to admit, it is a pleasure to see. On the other hand, Isabella Leong plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, pitiful, extremely reserved figure. Overall, I find this film a disappointment.
