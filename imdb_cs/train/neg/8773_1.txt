If you've seen a lot less movies, it could be great for you. If you've seen a lot of movies, it's a joke. Playing real heroes is shown very badly. Not to mention the scriptures, lots of shots and, most importantly, the battle scenes are stupid. New characters, good directions, would do a better job, but since it contains all heroines / heroines, you can predict what will happen next. If you do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they are losing are terrible, mainly because we saw this actor in 1,000 other Hindu films. It's supposed to be a realistic movie, but it can not show up. Sometimes you're interested, you have thousands of armies stuffed by soldiers moving and Pakistani bombing them, and none of their bombs are attacking. Are the guys really bad at targeting or the director to look stupid? There were few characters that were very good, but when it comes to the plot, the action is misdirected. This movie could be short if they chose songs, played back, and held.
