Okay, here it is: "The Nazi mountaineer is spinning with the Dalai Lama." What we are doing is that we first get a star with no idea how to make a German accent, and let it fly after two hours between French, German, American and British. Then we set up a series of wildly unlikely events and deployed them very broadly, so the fence joints almost imperceptibly. Just to make sure the viewer is not asleep, we throw in details that are shockingly absurd, like our hero who smokes a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. Of course we also have to note that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so every character, even the smallest peasant in the forbidden closed city of Lhasa in 1943, speaks perfectly English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the bottom part is how to deal with the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: We have Dalai Lama friendly with the reformed Nazis, because the other is so good that they have to deal with film projectors, radios, antique automobiles and all other facilities representing the freedom of the capitalist West. Our hero, in return, will learn from his young protege some vague, undefined Buddhism that is never really done or seriously treated. We also have lots of scenes where the hero attracts all the marks of respect and protocol that other Tibetan societies admit to the Dalai Lama, even though we pretend that the hero has a profound and deep respect for these people and their spiritual leaders. In other words, we expect viewers to believe that this guy is Buddhist today, in a way, though we do not seem to know what his transformation is or how far we want it to go. Last but not least, at the end of the film, there is a statistic about how the Chinese have treated the Tibetans with shocks (which is certainly true), and so we have accused us of making a "political" film, even if it is nothing like that. So, here's my thought. Zat zinkujete? Can I make a movie?
