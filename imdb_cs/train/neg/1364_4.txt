the more I think about it, the film about this movie was not redeemed. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I met the director. he seemed to be so insignificant what he did or did, and if I could say he did not like the movie either. he even agreed that he did not know what he was doing, and he was forced to do certain things because he was digitally shot. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was trying hard to fit into a formula he himself built: "9 people have to be connected in some way. <br /> <br /> We can get from the 'A' to point 'B' "so that we can get from the prostitute we see at the beginning and back to her at the end of 10 minutes on each person's relationship with another person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> to one redeemed part of the film. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi is one scene where it's amazing. and it is done. as I say ... 4 of 10.
