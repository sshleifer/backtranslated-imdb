The poster that called this word "Plotless and meaningless" literally took the words I would use in the subject. The only thing I would add is "no passion". For a movie created by a real married couple and representing a lot of graphic sexual scenes, this film will be able to do what should be a vicious situation in one for the ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look dull during sex scenes and the viewer could also take Valium and do it with him. Also, women in the audience have seen WAY too many used swabs at their time, and every guy who is turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pull the bloody swab from his wife's vagina needs therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the film (if any) is a restaurant where the waiter explains to eternally sleepy Dafoe what is "deconstructed jambalaya". (All the ingredients of the dish are still splitting rather than together.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: a haunted, isolated house, a dead husband, a scary violin, a strange guardian who comes and goes the way he likes, death from a car accident and near death, characters with a secret past. Basically, every thriller clich√© you can think of, but NEVER gather. Everything just sits there and never encounters a continuous conspiracy or even an artistic mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe goes to "deconstructed jambalaya". Prospective tenants of this mess should leave this deconstructed thriller on the shelf of the video store well.
