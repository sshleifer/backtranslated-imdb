If you're looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected by live artists. The visials are nice and interesting to see throughout the film. Now, when you say that, visuals are the only thing that's good with Captain Sky. After ten minutes, I knew I was looking at one of the worst movies ever. I was hoping to improve this movie, but never achieved any interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to go out was growing and growing. Now I have more than 2000 movies and I've probably seen this number five times. Still, it's just the second movie that I felt like I was leaving my whole life. <br /> <br /> There is no --- act. The three main artists are pitiful. Jude Law (even in the next movie I wanted to leave) is terrible in the title role. I prefer sitting in Ben Affleck in Gigli before I look back at the law again. Paltrow is trying so hard to be a cameraman that her face is getting worse. The last article I read said that Paltrow intends to stay at home and be more of a mother than to act. After this speech, I would appreciate this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soap opera is better to write. The story behind Sky's captain begins badly and gradually worsens. <br /> <br /> Mode --- none. Everything was given to the special effects that the story, acting and direction suffered greatly. Even a "fantastic threat" has better acting and it does not say much. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie "0" of "10". Do not forget to pay for theater fees and wait until you release the video.
