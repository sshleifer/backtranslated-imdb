I came to it with my hopes upstairs, I could not let it go down for twenty minutes into the movie. Even though it was another terribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... maybe someone could do it this time. It is obvious that Prom Night is on the same level of quality as the recent reworking of April Fools, bad scenario, bad direction, cheesy exaggerated acting and generally horrible horror. From the beginning to the end, it's boring, repetitive, about a dozen eye roles. We've seen it before and we've seen that this was a million times better. If you look at Prom Night at the theater (say, wait for DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh because they will laugh. Laughs are not in movies that should be entertaining, in response to the key "exciting" moments in the movie that are so badly done, you feel like watching the latest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be remake or spoof? The filmmakers so badly lost the mark that a large number of viewers in the theater I attended walked around the film. Which one from the back view would like me to do it. Neither did I have to torture and stick with it, I hope it will be better. Needless to say, it was not. Horror scenarios are a joke, not because it's about playing, but about direction, scenario, "special effects" and working with the camera. The film can look as if he spent the fortune to make it, but it still came out of the microfilm. I was expecting some props to see dollar signs on some props, and I always thought I'd see some porn star somewhere. <br /> <br /> These scary movies are fine, if it's the future of a big budget horror, then the horror genre is doomed to extinction.
