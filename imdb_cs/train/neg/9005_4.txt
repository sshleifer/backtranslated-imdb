If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci-fi horror films are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and get this down. The film begins in a merry old England around 1100 and then moves to California today. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new head of security and military advisor for a scientific laboratory 400 meters underground. Comes (Carver is a helicopter pilot) with the lead Scientist and soon we find it a cloning lab and have something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the films above, hell is falling apart and our characters are starting to pick. Special effects on Monster are pretty good for "movie right" movies, and Dean Cain does what he pays for. But do not forget the rest of the group when we find out why we've never seen them before. Again, you do not go with high expectations and you will be fine.
