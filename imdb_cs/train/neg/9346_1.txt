This movie was yawning from titles to credits, it's boring to what's going on, and the acting is wooden and curled! It is true that director Richard Jobson has directed his debut, but who on earth has lit the script as badly developed like this one? It looks like extra money from drains of the government project (Scottish Screen are credited with surprises, surprises). I almost fell asleep three times, and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one. Please, Mr. Jobn, what did you do before you were directing this sedative from the movie, go to him!
