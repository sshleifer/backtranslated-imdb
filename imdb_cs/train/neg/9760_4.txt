The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territory, so the film was dominated by the Israeli party. I was struck by almost completely opposite views of mothers. An Israeli mother lost a child who had the chance to live a life of great happiness. A Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the possibility of life of despair and despair. With so completely different views, no encounter had any real chance for any meeting of mind. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. The room of Israel was safe. With such a gap, is this movie really good? I finished the feeling that I was watching the absurd propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
