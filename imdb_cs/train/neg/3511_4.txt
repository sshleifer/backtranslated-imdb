"I'm working for a sinister corporation that is doing industrial espionage in the future, and I'm beginning to be confused by who I am. I have headaches and things are sprawling, and there is no other sublimatively fast noisy set of significant yet mysterious images ..." I rented because some reviews were all good. Why? Cypher is an inexpensive, boring, boring film set in a poorly conspicuous future world, with wooden outlets and a ridiculous end. The enchanting sense that something interesting might happen will keep you watching a series of constantly stupid and unconvincing events before movie makers clap in the face of the ending that links the worst Bond to the video of Duran Duran. It is painfully obvious that they earned production by Dr Who designed improvised special effects to include a couple of good (if small Babylon 5) CGI pieces. This sub-Fight Club, under Phil Kick Dick's new thriller, strives for a much wider range than its modest budget allows. Cool blue mood served with a serious feeling - unsatisfyingly stupid. This is not a smart sci-fi, it's a computer game site.
