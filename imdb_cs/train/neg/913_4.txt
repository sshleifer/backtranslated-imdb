OK, you see. What was fun in the first movie? I know people with funny accents, people falling in the water, ship crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie, the accent has shaken part of the max, nothing good. A lot of people fall into the water for no good reason, no good. Boatcrash, check. Fun comments between the two teams tried, but failed. Also there are too many personalities who are watching in this movie. This movie should be about what's happening on the water, not on the ground. I'm sorry it's too far between the fun parts and the movie sponsors are exploited to max. It's not good. Overall, I gave him four out of ten, because he has some funny parts.
