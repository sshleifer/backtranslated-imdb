The latest film Tarzan, starring Johnny Weissmuller (a surprisingly old year after "Tarzan and Hunt"), is bad, despite all the trivia that can be added to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO attempted to say goodbye to Weissmuller, to shoot in a beautiful scenery in Mexico, with the top star of the country (Andrea Palma) and many award-winning cameraman Gabriel Figuera, and bring the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin the score. Although it may be less costly to shoot abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO movie in a series using Acapulco beaches and real pyramids like Aquatania with impressive decorations for all scenes connected to the Balu temple, especially the exterior built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann was to remain as a director instead of Robert Florey, who is giving him a very slow pace. Neumann did a great job with "Tarzan and Amazon", "Tarzan and Leopard" and "Tarzan and Lovec" and completed his career, which was the classic "The Fly" a year before his death; while Florey became a television director after a few remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee who plays Cheeta is not as good as the other, but the worst figure is Benji, an unpleasant postmaster singing spooky songs (which have Caribbean air in the place to be Africa and shoot in Mexico!) A dull and definitely dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller Tarzan.
