I would not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. However, he performs as an important poet / musician in his literary / musical heritage. By far the most precious feature of this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Stunning and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians performing at the concert did not talk about the nuances of Leonardo's musical-literary way. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were exceptions, although Leonard highly values ​​the interpretation of Ruf Wainrights of his songs. What was really unsuccessful in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how the musicians join him. There is a lot to say about this, but the viewer does not learn Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident from interviews with Bono and Edge. They consider Leonard a special icon, but they can not translate the exact value of Leonardo Cohen. Cooperation with U2 is a farce. All live signup looks like a hasty job. As in the entire film, only his Leonard Cohen remains and can tell himself. The whole set-up and script is similar to an out-of-school project at high school. Effects such as echo, slow motion, or flash shots are poorly positioned. Some camera work is grim. Part of the score hardly resembles any association I expected. Sometimes the filmmaker seemed to add psychotic elements to the film. Possible reference to his once-use LSD. Some unintentional humor ... at some point, Leonard tells how he influenced the musical genre. At first, he can not remember the name of the genre until he finally says it's punk, the punks really picked up their music. Another scene in the movie is a live cover "I can not forget" ... <br /> <br /> "And I can not forget, I can not forget I can not forget but do not forget who"
