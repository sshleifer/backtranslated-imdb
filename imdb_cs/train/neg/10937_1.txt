Once in a long time when a movie appears, it will be so terrible that I feel forced to warn people. If I work all my days and save only one soul before watching this movie, how much will it be my pleasure. Where to start a debate about pain. For beginners, musical installations were every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was stereotyped. We were blaming a guy, a fat guy who ate donuts, a fucking foreign guy, etc. The script was as if it were written when the film was shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it seemed to me that I was watching a junior high-profile video. Do they have directors, producers, etc. Have they ever seen a movie? Halestorm worsens and worsens every new item. The concept of this movie sounded so funny. How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But believe me, when I say it, things go wrong, very bad.
