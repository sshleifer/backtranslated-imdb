A reviewer from Poland must be a feminist, as she finds out that "Young Catherine" is a great film and historically accurate. Nothing can be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, for many years, I have, with YC, made an exception at almost every step, and especially her politically correct depiction of the boss who unilaterally moved Russia into the direction of dominance. Truth? She was brought to St. Petersburg only to be a woman and mother, and she found she had to "bind" with the court, the warrior and the military to survive. Until she doubted she was able to afford her cultural wishes (to fill Hermitage with artistic treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "great," but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit fluffy from Ted Turner, who as "Peter the Great" in 1986 is another example of how much Russia is portrayed in the West.
