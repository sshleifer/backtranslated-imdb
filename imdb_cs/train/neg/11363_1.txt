This movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every problem. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But boy, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood movie about film in the movie. The shadows are so clear that we are not ready to produce "big Hollywood movies." I'm not a film critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. Just like my subject says it's nothing, then loops. You can just watch TV without seeing anything. That was the feeling we had when we saw Shades. Shades are PRODUCTS !!!
