With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season One. I can not imagine what they think. As a horror fan, he can tolerate a lot of gore and soulless chaos, but this series gets worse at every trip. I can not imagine how it must be frightening for actors and crew to go to work every day and try to earn such bullshit. STORY! Is it too much to ask for? CHARACTER! How can we do some damn fate in these stories? If we are not engaged, who is interested in whether they are dragged or what? Almost every episode ends with insignificant blood, which happens in a brutal shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion, or the REASON of why we were subjected to an hour of bloodshed. Even Dante's efforts in this season had some worrying sexist violence, and he was unlikely to conclude. The irony is that production values ​​and performance are prone to speed, while the content is a total cache. I have a great chance of winning Garri's Garris VALARIE POD STAŽIÍ, but we'll see.
