"Crowded" is not a common move. It is very bad to be common. One man goes to the other with machine guns. The other man firs one wheel and a man with more firepower falls without a lead hail falling over him. Guess which one is a good guy. Spirit. Such is "overcrowded" through and through. It's not a good film hit, not a good movie, not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels, because its B-movie veteran actors mechanically move the motions almost as if they know they're really losing. It is not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
