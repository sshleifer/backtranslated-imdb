Um ... Okay, I think I have the whole gorilla shooting technique, but unfortunately I think the gorilla could make a better movie ... This was just a complete mess. Bad behavior, bad direction, bad story, and terrible cinematography. As this piece of waste was released, I will never know, but unfortunately I watched it. Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across the Eyes," I'm supposed to look like a Blair Witch movie, but just ... Well, the nose is diving off the cliff. I was really embarrassed with the young women I had promised to the Hollywood star, but it ended in a pile of dung. Dialogue is ridiculous and really makes you worse when you listen to it. How horrible it is, there is another secret because there is nothing even remotely frightening about it except the fact that I was watching it ... Try this to the size: It's 5 of you and 1 of her, do math and beat her ass. .. "End". The peasant went on (and he) for another 95 minutes of mind-blinding stupidity ... I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
