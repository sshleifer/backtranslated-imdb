I have a high tolerance for bullshit, so I'm looking forward to it. It did not disappoint. Obviously based on classical Carmilla Sheridan Le Fanu, she follows fathers and daughters of hunting female vampire who fortunately travels with them. Then we have the Santa Claus (or the general, as he is called here), who runs over random zombies. Did I mention that there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are coming back to life, but no one seems to be too concerned. We have zombie construction workers, zombie soldiers, and even Zombie Trinity pupils. It seems that Santa Claus is looking for a daughter who has become a vampire. Oh, wait, they're not vampires, the girl's in the madhouse, and Carmilla is her nurse, is not she? Zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I love zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like simulated licking so the juices flowing. When do we see vampires fighting zombies? Is he a vampire or a madman? Or both? Is Carmilla Hot Sexy Lesbian Vampire or Nurse? More makeup, you never have enough licking. This is where the Third Third Zombies come. Chain time !! More lesbian sex then zombies kill and eat vampires. I think the zombie won or not? Conspiracy? Who needs a story when you have lesbian vampires and zombie pupils? And kissing?
