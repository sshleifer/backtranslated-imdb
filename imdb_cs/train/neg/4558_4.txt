I was frankly disappointed in the "Expiration Date". Very clever title and interesting premise, but I do not think it was delivered. What was it about? The main man's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or, most likely, it was his need to overcome the fear of death. But he was not set up as a man who lived in fear - it seems as if his life was fine, but he should start looking after the approaching day. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the supportive characters in the film do not seem to have the needs that slip into the umbrella story. They all did their thing running parallel to the main character. Also what was considered a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he simply intend to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? These are my critics, but I loved shots in Seattle, the cinema was beautiful, acting was good in times when it was not great.
