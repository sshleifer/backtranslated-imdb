Known for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), it is the unclear biggest advantage, it seems. Hey, it's often better to talk, rather than actually see when you can not back the "legend" with substance. The film has played in Los Angeles several times recently, and is available on home video, so the veil is slowly rising. While there is still a lot to offend the masses, it is more likely that they are bored than to bring true passion. In addition to the voluntary and lengthy sex scene XXX between a pair of horses ("Nature Documentary" someone?), Followed by almost an hour of boring arranged marriage melodrama. When sex and nudity begin, it is a continuous sequence involving masturbation, a recollection of alleged "beauty and deer," and a naked woman running around the house (nobody, even her allegedly protective aunt, seems to even think about it give some clothes!). On the video, I think you can move over banality, but it really does not fit. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something far more substantial than Bertolucci THE DREAMERS. Try to find someone "moral" or "symbolism" in the carnal, I doubt it is a good one's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the film better, the acquaintance of something "forbidden" has been canceled. And this animal was tamed.
