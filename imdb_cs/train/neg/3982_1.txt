For love to God please do not see this movie! It's a waste of time, a plot is predictable, as well as a romantic scene. I'm trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame. The characters are not being developed and most of the film is shot by footage from Rome, which is much more interesting than the real movie. On top of everything, acting is a shame. I know everyone is trying to find their place, but it really is a disaster. I can not believe that someone has actually paid so many million pounds to make this movie on screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, look for your grandmother or something worth the place.
