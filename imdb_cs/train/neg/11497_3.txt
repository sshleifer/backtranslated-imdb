This warning against anti-Semitism is well thought out and could have its purpose at the time, but it does without the slightest idea of ​​how to make a movie. The director has no idea of ​​mission-en-scene; cast differs from bad to even worse. Great Austrian comedian Hans Moser is useless. In his part he ends up in madness for asylum, which is designed as a set by Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; one asks if the creators had all their mental abilities. The restored copy I've seen (the Dutch Filmmuseum) gives the impression that some scenes have not been put in the right place, but the original layout may have been bad too.
