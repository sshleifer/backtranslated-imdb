Anyone who would find the redemption of value in this bite should examine his head. We have a captivating, heroin-dependent, partially sophisticated woman with a tearing-in all over her body, the ruptures of repeatedly whining an abusive son. Now they crush breast milk on the floor in the kitchen, so relaxation has given him a similar opportunity to put Helen Keller's hands into the running water. We have that husband who begins under the auspices of a prostitute who becomes his daughter (she is angry with him because she has come too quickly) and ends with the murder of her colleague, sex with her corpse, and then she breaks her. We have this boy who is tirelessly bullied by his classmates, who returns home and beats his mother. You know, it's all circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this haunted pile of dwarves is when the father kills his martyrs. It's a good thing that this turkey was filmed on a video because otherwise it would mean losing a precious movie. If the guy who thinks artists are interested in this promise is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are crazy. We saw this filthy movie, and then they breathed "Zero Woman, the Accused". Oh God, it was bad that was worse. What's happening in Japan these days? Sick, ill, sick.
