I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and poorly introduced film is a filmmaker whose other work I have enjoyed. The experience of LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word, but "permanent" will do) left me in a nasty mood, a condition alleviated by just reading IMDb's ali-112 comment. For Rohmer not only sought to see the world through the genre art of the 18th century French, but, as revealed by ali, proved (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of the two classes of revolution that inspired the eyes of the elusive woman time. The director has done something undoubtedly difficult, but I wonder if it's worth the effort he needed to do - or we can watch the tedious results of his work.
