I just watched American Pie: Beta House and I have to say that it was such a pile of rubbish. The first three American cakes were merry, the last three were jokes and should not be called American cake. How did you realize that the title from Beta House is about brotherhood, youth, girls and the most original part of all, in love. Of course, the guy who has the way of the young is Stifler, who, along with his friends, will try to complete another apparently impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It's really predictable and the conspiracy is so weak. Both sides of the college fight to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To summarize: awful action and blunt script + bad use of American Pie franchise = total time wasting! This movie is unbearable. I give her two out of ten, though most of it was soaky, there were lots of nudity and pretty girls like 2 funny scenes :)
