I was expecting a movie like Deuce Bigalow that I enjoyed. This crazy, however, seemed to last forever. It's one of those movies that enjoys the sad location of PG-13 without being suitable for children. Jokes are not just jokes, they are rough, crazy, and many acts cross the borders not only for bad taste but for legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been sliced ​​to get a PG-13 rating ... too bad ... it could make a bigger splash like R rated movies if it's funny. (Overstatement - this movie does not answer, it's a waste of time ... and I'm a film lover, and I'm ready to release something else.) After 45 minutes, the movie felt as though it was supposed to look ... and the kid was ready for it. it's quaint, but it will not save the rest of this swamp / hiking trap for rent. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a single ... it would be bad to pay hard-earned money for this beam)
