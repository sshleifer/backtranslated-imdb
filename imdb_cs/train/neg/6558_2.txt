We borrowed five films for the New Year's Eve weekend and we first looked at it. All I can say is there was no place to go, but after that. It was useless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script had to be easy to write - just two of every three words cursed word. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in character, but the film has nothing but to recommend.
