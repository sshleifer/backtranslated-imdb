It is likely that if I were to watch again, I could be physically ill, the film is so annoying ... until you believe in psyche, reincarnation, and other hocuspoque, what it supports in the long run. "Recycling Souls" call it here. Puh-leeze. This story has taken place several times earlier with such films as "Heaven Can Wait". It was also much better. It was a shame they had to lose the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cyblo Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it is a rather tame film, language-wise. This is probably the only redemption of the quality of this film.
