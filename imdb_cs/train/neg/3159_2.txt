I'm sorry, boys, I've written my opinion on this movie, but today I was the first day I looked at some other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what's scary is that there are some people who really like this movie. I do not want to write ugly reviews or criticize the opinions of other people, but I think it is fair to point out to someone who could discuss whether or not this film sees it. It's not a good movie. I like movies very much and I will only look at anything, but this movie got to the incredibly short list of films I watched and was happy to have left half. If you're really incredibly tempted, check out the trailer ... that's the bug I've done because the whole movie is basically a trailer ... after there's no surprise, just some shocking bad dialogue that's going to take time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop the other people who spend their hours in a movie like this!
