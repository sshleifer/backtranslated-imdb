My mother keeps the tape of this film as a general threat to any loving film that is poisoning her. Everything was pissed about. <br /> <br /> As such, it's a real classic. Who gave her 10/10? Were you inadvertently watching a good movie and you accidentally voted for this? Everyone involved in the filmmaking process should be forced to watch at least a small part of the film. It should be an indelible stain in the minds of everything that keeps the film sacred and is worshiped as an influx of cinematic horror.
