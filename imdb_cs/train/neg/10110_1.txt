This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not even talking. It was bad and actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie my friends and I could build up for themselves. The case that the movie came is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie on the front of the case. It seems that a director or make-up artist has just put a black eyeliner under some eyes and called them a zombie. Loans at the beginning of the film take almost 20 minutes of film. Which credit tracking was the best part of the movie. It was a really horrible movie and I could not believe how bad it was. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes they were like, "What's wrong?" The sound was terrible, and the action shots looked like a couple of teenagers looking around the fake scene. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about renting or buying this movie, I advise you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how terrible it really is. I wish I could follow it before I leased it.
