The zombie rebellion is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's pretty far off the list. When the expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover a zombie trick after the First World War, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for their own bad ambitions. And it will succeed, at least initially. Love triangle complicates the story of some. It really was a lengthy movie, with terrible talk that made it hard to tell who the zombies were and who was not. The dialogue was somewhat better and the conspiracy was incredible (not the zombies, but the parts related to "romance"). And while I'm not a student or a cinematographer, working with the camera apparently did not help in the movie. <br /> <br /> While I saw a few worse movies, it's unlikely anyone would please. It's bad, and not so bad that it's a good way.
