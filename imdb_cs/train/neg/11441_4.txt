After the promising first 25 minutes that make you feel warm inside, you are quite convinced that it will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film shoots to the worse. <br /> <br /> A warmer feeling may still be there, but as others have said: The plot is so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is accelerating and you get the impression that you are either going through it fast, or that the producers have decided to fit in less than 1h40m and have to cut out a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a viewer, I'm quite convinced that this comedy is not deliberately unrealistic, it's just so. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad scenario, I think the performances are mostly good. If I only rated the first 25 minutes, I would probably give him eight. As it happens now, he gets four. ... And that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you're fun for a romantic comedy, you'll probably have a great time as well. If not, I would recommend that you look at something else.
