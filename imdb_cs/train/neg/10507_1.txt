OK and my friend rented it a few days ago because we wanted to watch b-movies since we were alone. The envelope contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and so ... and Tom Savini! There is no way this movie can fail! Right? poorly!! It seems like this waste! It was not really a story, the dialogue was horrible (there is someone there, X 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they really missed any personality ... The effects were horrible ... and what with them long artistic shots of terrified people, who run around doing nothing .. with extreme eye details and the like? We sat the whole movie and waited for something ... whatever happened ... but no ... "oh, here come nymphs! Super! Oh .. I kiss ... again ... and now for violence .. OK ... nothing really will happen ... again ... oh, now running around ... and close up your eyes ... again ... oh, heres Tom Savini! ... all right ... OK, maybe now something cool or even interesting happens .. no .. oh ... Cool ... cut off head ... end ... oh tears ... "And finally, because I'm so full myself .. I say you this! Give me a van, six actors, a strange-looking house, Tom Savini, some naked girls with fangs and blood buckets and I could do the best movie you've ever seen ... I made zero-budget movies in two days better acting, better acting and better scenario than this ... what does Johannes do this guy do? Making great movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I was really upset!
