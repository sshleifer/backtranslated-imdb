As the summary says you have just written the most ignorant comment I've ever heard about the RPG. Do you really think they're gay? Are you retarded? If you went to rescue your best friend and someone decides from the good of your heart to help you, then you are in serious debt to this man. Lavitz was a good man, and each time they helped each other, they made them closer as friends. They were not homosexual lovers, as if it happened to you. And to know, the game is set in the Middle Ages. At that time women prepared food while men fought. Do you even know your history? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the army today? This game has a lot of realism, although it's too damn slow, and of course you need to earn some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your misconduct to interpret the story.
