He spoke like a really cooked gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster films, but never ever mix this movie with Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. But what the film regularly watches painfully is all these Italian Americans who swing around how bad gangsta lines look like in a worse fake accent. Pacino would be great if they could just call him. I was looking forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but their thigh accents ruined the fun. And well, the scenario is not too hot. Dona Corleone would have disappeared five minutes after meeting, smiling and tapping him all the time.
