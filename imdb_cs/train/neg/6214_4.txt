What?!?? Why do people say it's "blowing the mind?" Just imagine the end is at the worst end of cinema history! 4 left and the whole world ended! Not to mention character 9 was an idiot all the time all of them killed him. 1 was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9, then it would not have happened. People who give life there for a stupid cause and for what? ... to make it rain? I admit the movie if it were his parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many of them were clich√©s one by one. And someone else got the feeling that it's like "The Lord of the Rings"? Characters have died for stupid reasons, there has been almost no character development, and sincerely ask yourself, it is good to have four men in the world; his nonsense and stupidity. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thank God! How robots rotate against people in a creative way! It happened a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, watch the movie that is worth watching as Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, that's good movies!
