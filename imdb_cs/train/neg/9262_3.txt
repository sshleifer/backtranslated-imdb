On the surface, the Omen 4 idea was good. It's nice to see that a devil's baby can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when the girls are obsessed or they are whores, it is very effective. But in Omen 4 it happened. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she might be a little girl, but she is a child with problems. Problems that maybe only a therapist, rather than a priest. It does not look frightening or devilish. Rather it looks embarrassed and moody. This film had the potential, and if it were made by the same people who made the previous three films, they could work. But it's really insulting to really go on in one of the most popular horror trilogy, as with specialized television films. <br /> <br /> It leaves it down on so many levels. It's cheap looking, acting is hammish and the effects are typical of TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy and you have no way behind them. I recently watched her again after somebody brought it to Christmas, and that was terrifying. <br /> <br /> If you think you're going to follow, I suggest you do not do it. Watch one of the others or watch the Exorcist, or see The Good Son. Do not waste time on this!
