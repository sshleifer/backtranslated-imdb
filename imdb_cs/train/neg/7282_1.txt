National Lampoon was a once funny magazine. Whether you liked the stone hippie days of the late sixties, or the seedy and deaf day of the coke heads in the 1970s (when the comedy was fortified with lots of nude bucks), it very much depends on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that in the early 1980s the age they lost all the remaining sparks of anarchist humor that did not have drugs, and sacrificing like this film, and more and more terrible Sprinter records capture more holes in the hull. Apart from the extraordinarily illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this uniquely depressing smelly. If you go through the covert introductory segment, "Growing Myself", I hope things get better, hard luck - no. Who thought that a woman brutally raped by a butter was a comedy gold that she deserved to put his head on dog dishes. If ever there is a global lack of guitar races, the negatives of this constant, incoherent ragbag with crazy thoughts and horrific performances can well serve a purpose.
