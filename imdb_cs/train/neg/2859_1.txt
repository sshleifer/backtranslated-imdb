It's made in 2007 and CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. On the one hand, the movie stops moving the dinosaur shot, which actually looks good, but it just makes an extremely amateur work on CG things look even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, playing, directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible. It's so bad, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... clean bullshit! Again, as with other films, the only scary part about this film is that it actually happened and is now being broadcast on a science fiction channel. I still can not understand how to get people who have some acting skills in some way to act in these movies and then make them somewhat as horrible as everyone else in the movie. For those of you who are not sure the second poster is of course to be sarcastic in his review ... or he is one of the people who worked on this film.
