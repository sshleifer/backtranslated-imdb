Not that I was really surprised ... movies are never as good as the books they come from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because it's one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I hoped he was pleasantly surprised. However, they have strayed from the story of the book too, and the movie version did not tell how terrible this house really was. The end was different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of really bad cosmetic surgery. The game was at best indelible. Perhaps if the theatrical version were made so that they would not have to stay so much in the lifetime box "made for television movie", it would be a better move. If you've seen this movie, I highly recommend watching and reading the book. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you like it just as I do when I read it.
