I was fully used to seeing this movie. I waited a year for her to clean up in New Zealand. I did not have to build so much because it was so disappointing and it is undoubtedly the worst movie Clark There is so much wrong in this movie. First of all, some actresses are great, especially Nick Stahl as "The Bully" and a girl with curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most of them were so unpleasant and unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films and he was so great in the "Kids" category, but in "Bully" he is investing his series with such a festivity that his scenes return to parody practically. The screenplay felt like it was written by the first film student. I'm sorry, a high school student ... one who had never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Has he attempted to point out the absurdity of these children? He certainly could not prevent him from getting into a damn good pervy. I'm not violent but every 5 minutes I did not have to see teenage breasts and buttocks. I still say that Clark's best movie is "Another Day in Paradise". It's fantastic, and I do not think he's ever overcome it.
