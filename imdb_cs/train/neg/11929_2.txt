I was looking at "Eye" before I looked at this. I really liked the "eye", it was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror cinema. So I chose "Bangkok Scary" because it was the same director and it was a popular round here. But man, what disappointment ... "Bangkok scary" are three stories of love, revenge, spirits, etc., which are not at all scary or disturbing (like "Eye") ... nothing. I can not even fill out the 10 lines required for comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My number: 2/10
