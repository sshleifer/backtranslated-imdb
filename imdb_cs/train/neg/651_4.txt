I saw this movie a few days ago, and the gamma jumped up during the scary parts. I have to admit that I found it quite decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters are saying. Logic problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit guy, will not make any sound of killing. Do not you think he would at least try to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When it turns out that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was in love with her, you do not have such remarks if you have half your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> cars and drive away, far, then bait the house with HRT and police forces, so the killer has no way of getting out? I could go on. And further. And further. In fact, the plot was decent, the characters were not enough to really feel any empathy when they were defeated and too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie may be suitable for teenagers or young couples looking for a fun night. If you do not believe all goos, it's an average movie.
