This is the last time I hired a video without logging in with IMDB. Limey is directed by Steven Soderberg, who also wrote a really awesome Nightwatch with Ewan MacGregor, and directed such a scrap as Out of Sight with Jennifer Lopez's anti-war. Terence Stamp is a fine actor, and it's a shame he's involved in such a bad movie. There is often a mumbled editing that seems to have been the decision at the last minute to cope with a flaw or story, filming and just common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What did they think?
