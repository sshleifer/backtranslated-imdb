It's a terrible movie, a terrible script, a bad direction, and a meaningless ending. Also poor performances, with the exception of Clancy Brown, who is criminally neglected here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was cleansing - you do to expose enough bad karma to the movie so you really can see a good next line. The film features fathers and sons who seem to be unable to be related. Part of the male leadership is not well written and appears to be non-harmonic in this role. You can see that the plot is miles away. The actions of women's leadership and that of her brother, cop, also do not make sense. So the main action from her side at the end of the movie does not make sense for the script.
