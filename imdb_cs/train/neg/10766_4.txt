Everyone who sees Tammuz's children knows he is a director who can do better. Hopefully it was not too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And that's the case of the other jitters. Characters are one-dimensional and are used more. The scene is stunning and beautiful to see the Pacific Northwest. Cinema is great. Covered almost entirely outdoors, the pictures are sharp and beautiful. You can almost feel the wind blowing through the leaves. Technically, this movie is as vibrant as they come - it just lacks the heart.
