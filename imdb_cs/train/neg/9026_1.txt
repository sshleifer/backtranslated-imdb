That must be the worst direction I've seen. Proximity can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but a close, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery with Mexico, the canyons, the magnificent manor house where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty city of Costner is moving on his way of revenge. Unfortunately, we only take these places quickly before the camera switches to a big, giant head image. Even the transition scenes, in which Costner drives himself all over Mexico, will quickly retreat. <br /> <br /> The score is dramatic and disturbing, dictating all the emotions we should feel. The story itself should have been much better. Among other things, too many people have emerged from nothing to help Costner - it's just a bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical story about thrillers, but many others have assumed the same premise and done great things with it. Cost No's Out had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better film. <br /> <br /> The end was completely anticlimactic and suffered the most melodramatic score of the film. This movie has never been great, but if we saw more Mexico and less giant heads, this movie could be observable.
