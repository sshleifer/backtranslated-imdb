I've seen most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager at Cliffhanger Theater, which ran after midnight at the local station a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater appeared at the beginning of the nineties. Time was not kind. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I can think of special effects that were very impressive for a low-budget series of 50s (Commando Cody's flying IMO scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman in his TV show). And I can adapt myself to "acting" and fight choreography. with the exception of the guy who plays the lord of the Moon. It's incredibly bad. He looks and behaves like the one who comes to fix your installation, not the despotic ruler of a strange race. Even the crotch talk works correctly - they all cruise lines like stunt strings without waste of time or stopping things like "thinking" or "introspection." Since everyone is doing this, the viewer absorbs it after a while, and even to my modern feelings it does not bother. <br /> <br /> What really irritates me is writing and drawing. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the moon, or about rocking boats on soy or a flying suit that has controls labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow". I do not even worry about the resilience of the distinction to the dudes who end each chapter. I'm talking about our supposed heroes being stupid than fence posts and not having cumulative memory. And, even though the dialogue sections hide as an express train, the plot goes through the same movements over and over again. <br /> <br /> Dig: Commando Cody and his friend are the top secret secret hi tech scientists in charge of protecting the Earth (or at least the US) against the insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front door. So bad guys go right and beat the crap of Cody and his staff ... not once (maybe understandable) but SOME TIMES. They even kidnap their female assistant on the second attempt. And they never became smarter. To further prove my point, let me show how Cody jumps into his flying suit and flies around as he gets into trouble and never seems to be able to catch someone. It's been doing it over and over again. Cody is also flying his boat to the moon (the female assistant comes to the cooking), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and returns. Cody captures one of the atomic beam weapons ... and immediately loses him with bad guys because he can not bother him to lock him. And so you would think that if Cody's effort was so important to save the US from the moons that he could ask several soldiers with carbines, several helicopters and two tanks to support him instead of working with the local police all the time. It was a military operation, but they act like another "Gangbusters" episode. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty heavy stomach. I appreciate the fact that the creators were seriously limited by their budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is really a hard hombre (even if he loses half of his battles). But I just can not help shout "DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when the gangsters simply go to their lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no safety measures at the landing site ... nor a fence (!). <br /> <br /> It's OK. Of the three television series I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better storyline, and the "Underwater Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but that's fine. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "Radar" men? They did not use radar, they used atomic rays. Should not these titles "Atomic Ray from the Moon?"
