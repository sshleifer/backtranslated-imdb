Some rapporteurs and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about the zombie epidemic, despite the government's control of the media. The filmmakers do not understand that George Romer's zombie films work only because he consistently sticks to his policy in the backdrop of most of his films (the "Land of the Dead"). This satire is about as smooth as a face brick or a bullet on the head is more suitable for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle when you see a military man masturbating for death and destruction? Did anything differentiate between the different ads that are linked in the movie? No way. In addition, acting is evenly horrifying, the characters are detachable and the chart is unpleasant. Add this all and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie movie because "C.H.U.D. 2" behaved it's a nasty head. <br /> <br /> My level: D
