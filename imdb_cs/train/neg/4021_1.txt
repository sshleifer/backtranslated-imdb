That's probably the worst movie he ever did, it's just a bad name for Roger Corman. I could have understood this in the early years when it had lower budgets, but there is no justification for the birth of it today! I'm "B" a film degenerate and some people all I love is postponed by "ordinary viewers" but they take my word, Vampire club makes my list the best of the worst It's hard to imagine vampires without fangs, a musical score is completely out of the box, the sound effects are simply ineffective, and eventually Mr Svage does not seem to know he's in the vampire movie at all that he's bad because he had a "bad" career. Let me know that I'm hard on this cause when I do not like a movie I've rather forgotten to be a good site.
