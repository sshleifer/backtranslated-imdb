Generally, I will not do minus, and if this site could give this movie -3 out of 10, it means I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll was the worst in the dark I've seen, but at least I think he gave him 2.5 out of 10 (Stephen Dorff shot at nothing that made me laugh, so I got some ratings). Hell, if it was compared to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win Oscar for the best film if they were competitive. Now the plot is about a BTK killer who is fine but could do better. Start started to look OK, but I had to do it mostly because it's sad. I love killer movies, and even if they feel they can still get some great deaths. I'm not a movie fan, but believe me he would shoot if he saw it. I'm sorry it happened, but that's not good, because it looks like somebody shot a video camera and made this ... this disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of the worst movies ever taken. I'm sorry I could not explain the conspiracy (if there was one) but it was the best I could. Now that you do not mind I crawl and move back and reminds me how bad this movie has scared me to life ... OK not for life
