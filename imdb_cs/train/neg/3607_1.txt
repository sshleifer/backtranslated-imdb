I'm starting this review with a great giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read more ... here it comes, turn away your eyes! The main actor, a girl who always survives in other Slasher films, is murdered here. Here I saved you 79 minutes of your life. This is one of those cheap films that were thrown out in the middle of the 80's straw-era. Despite the killing of a heroine, it's just an incomparable junk. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad rap. They are portrayed as oversexed, sociopathic fools who have too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college school life ... and college students come even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just gunk to put in your video recorder when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your heads cleaner tape would be more fun. It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, fury, very short female nudity and sexual links. <br /> <br />
