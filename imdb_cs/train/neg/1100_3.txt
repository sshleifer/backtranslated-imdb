Since most reviews of this film are already decades ago, I would like to add an even more recent version, the film is open with the B-17 bombardment photographic record of Germany, the film is shot on the sign of Hauptmann (captain) Wusta Oskar Werner and his helpers, who get into the shelter when they get into the Hitler Führer bunker as soon as they are inside, are informed by the staff of the bunker, the film is then replaced on one of the many conference scenes where Albin Škoda gives a decent impression that Adolf Hitler collects his officer on "Ultimate Victories "while Werner's character is shown as slowly coming to the realization of the bunkers of the denizens are trapped in the fantasy world - some non-bunker events are depicted, the most notable is the metro flooding system to prevent Russian overtaking over them and a small subset comprising a young member of the Flak unit unit families with survivors - This film suffers from a number of detailed inaccuracies that the German film produced only after 10 years after World War II were not included; the Goebbels actor (Willy Krause) wore the same uniform as Hitler, including the shoulder of the eagle - Goebbels wore a brown Nazi uniform with a swastika bandage - SS soldier wore a German army camouflage, a well documented Hitler scene giving an iron cross to the Hitler youth boys, (it was done outdoors in the courtyard) and eventually Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian browning model 1922 - most accounts agree that it was Walther PPK - but some also seem to be totally inaccurate with the drunken dance scene close the end of the film, which is remarkable, this bit is depicted as a cabaret skit, with a drunk wounded soldier (his arm in the head) maniacally goose - passes to music, while the sister makes a combination of striptease / belly dance, all with candles ... really embarrassing watching - the most incredible is when Werner's captain Wust gained the audience himself with Hitler's Hitler, Hitler is depicted as falling on the wall, stunned and indignant when Werner's character starts to question, Hitler starts shouting, which brings the SS guard who mortally hurt Werner's character on his back with a shot - this fictional scene is not based on any true historical account -Verner's character then pulls away to die in the hallway while Hitler is preparing his own end, Hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but suicide is out of the screen, the last second of the Hitler film show the funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into the haunted image of the face of the dead Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust - this film is more alert than historical and anyone interested in this period would be better assured of newer movies such as the remake of "Hitler: The Last 10 Days "or" German film "Downfall" (Der Untergan g), if they want a more accurate quantification of this dramatic story, the latter two films are based on first-person eyewitness accounts with the bein of "Hitler: the Last Ten Days," compiled from the autobiography of Gerhard Boldt as Fuehrer's bunker officer and "Downfall" from Hitler's mysterious "Let's Take Away" screenplay is taken from the book of American Justice Judge Michael Musman of the Nazi Nazi War of Ten in Ten Nights, which is rather a compilation of the event (many apparently fantastic) than the history of eyewitnesses - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's account "Last Day of Hitler" was never shot in the film.
