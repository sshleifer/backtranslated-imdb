This movie is also fun and painful. "Cinemagic" almost made me an attack. Despite what they suggest, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical process. She was "developed" as a result of an accident and used it because they masked the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. I also do not think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". This movie is good for laughs if you really are looking for a movie made in 9 days for $ 200,000. It's fun; at least I can say so. The color / rat / spider is highlighted.
