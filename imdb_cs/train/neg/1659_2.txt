This movie is terrible. Dimming is waiting for a point. There is not much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to some great lines ("I found a tooth in my apartment") and the main characters involved in the killing itself, it is a collection of allegedly mysterious sounds. <br /> <br />
