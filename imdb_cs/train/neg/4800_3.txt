If you shot the genre at the end of the 1980s, you were basically 50/50 likely to be underwater or in jail (unfortunately we never received an underwater jail). In a murder interview, Maurice Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), ends up on the death penalty next to Frankie Sarcinello Jr.'s brother-in-law brother. But that's the smallest of Derek's problems as a dirty government agent (and a crowd of stools) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) uses the prison as a test site for a new supervirus. This is the only film Saxon has directed during his story career. For a man who worked with a lot of directors, it seems that the only one he got from the tips was the Italian cheap. Sure, it's a low budget, but in the first 15 minutes you can not apologize for cramped staging, shooting range or clumsy exposition. Because of his efforts, Saxon made it a bit horrifying and working in a merry naked scene (our leadership is doing well during the prison revolt just to fancy the female scientist). Cole, who looks more harsh than Jan-Michael Vincent, is as good as stoic lead, and Franciosa - a really bad carpet - gives him everything as the clich√© of the crowd. The ending takes place in the popular spot of Marty McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
