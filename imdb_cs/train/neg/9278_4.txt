The fact that I was watching this whole movie says something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. Seriously. But terrible was the way that kept my attention in such a perverse way that it resembles the observation of the tragedy and can not turn away. It would be a great MST3K! Most of the things that make a terrible movie a pleasant one are: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, fictional plot sequences, absurd pseudoscience. You will recapture the deadly death sequence, the poor victims with the agape, and waaaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their imminent debauchery, facing the terribly conceived provider of their deaths. Your heart gets warm with the old action scene clich√©s like when two women fight for a gun and it goes out but WHO'S SHOT? They both look at themselves, then on the others, then on themselves, then (it seems, 15 minutes later), finally going down. You will, of course, sing (in Latin, of course) with street strollers that will turn into a ghostly death-chorus that for a moment threatens to turn the film into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you believe that when I do it when the movies get worse, they are getting better, it can be a decent choice for you. It's not as fun as a popular favorite sci-fi schlock, "Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's much more fun to watch than films like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10.
