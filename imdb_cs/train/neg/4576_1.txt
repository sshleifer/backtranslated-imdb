At first glance, this documentary / fictive / cartoon is quite fun and thoughtful. Of course, when something raises thought, then it can be explored. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with insinuations and insignificant conclusions. The connection that "what the color ..." you see between science and spirituality is actually not rooted in science at all. The transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that group meditation may in that case reduce crime in the area, Washington D.C. In fact, the HIC (Homicides, Rapes and Assaults) crime rate was 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was no drop in the rate of killing during the study. In fact, any statement that links metaphysics with science can and is revealed. The conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a bad attempt to blame people or a joke. Either way, I suggest you do not waste your time. If you are looking for a long film about science that could trigger thoughts, you can think of Mindwalk (1990).
