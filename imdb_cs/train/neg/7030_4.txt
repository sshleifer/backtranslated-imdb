One of the cornerstones of a low-budget cinema is to acquire a well-known, classic story and complete bastardization. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The scriptwriter takes over the permanent story of Phantom of the Opera and moves it to a shopping center late 80's. The goal of Phantom is simply to avenge those who are responsible for his deformation and murder of his family. Special effects provide good laughter, especially when parts of the body appear in yoghurt stalls. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as unpleasant as could be expected, mostly because his fifteen minutes of MTV's fame has not yet arrived. If you are looking for a few good laughs at the expense of crew crew and special effects, check out this. Otherwise, continue searching for another.
