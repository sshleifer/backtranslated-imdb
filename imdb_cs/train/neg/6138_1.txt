This movie was painful from the beginning to the execution. Do the US need to create "star wars" in this remote country? Is that their premise? The way to access the US is to win the obstacle course as a running event where the winner can ask any of the leaders. And who better win this race known as "play" than a gymnast? Of course! Gymnast would be the right choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was operative. For our hero, it is fortunate that gymnastic equipment such as a stone horse in the middle of a square (no reason) in the middle of a crazy city has become a happy place. Perfect. But the terrible, HORIBBLE assumption is the clumsy dexterity of romantic scenes, apparently highly depressing ninjas, whose only job seems to be holding the flag to point to the racetrack and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero gave us the wishes of the US government. Behold, all efforts are worthwhile because the USA gets its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! THIS IS TRIUMFANT FINAL ?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But still it's such a bad movie, it can be very fun to watch. The packaging itself, which shows the machine gunmen, was enough to rent the film. But if I actually met Kurt Thomas (the gymnast star), I would probably kick him in the face after a double berth with 2 1/2 twists in the layout.
