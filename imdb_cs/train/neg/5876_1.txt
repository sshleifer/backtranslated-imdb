I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (the actors bring most of their lines directly to the camera) to camera shots (all media or close-ups ... no scenery shots and very little shots) were terrible. I was looking at it for my spring break and it's very safe to say that I feel like I was eliminated from my 114-minute vacation. It is not recommended with any fantasy section.
