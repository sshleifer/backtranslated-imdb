"It seems that many critics consider Woody Allen's idea to be unbeatable." And for good reason: they are an unbearably wooden and demanding imitation of Bergman. And let's not let ourselves: the critics mostly supported Allen's testimony to Bergman and Allen's whimpering charges on the other hand. What I do not have is that why Allen was applauding for his originality imitating Bergman, but the current Brian DePalma was excreted for "hitchcock tears" in his thrilling / horror movies? In Robin Wood's opinion, this is a strange kind of cultural snobbery. I have to agree with that.
