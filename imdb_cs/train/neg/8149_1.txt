What an absolute pile of pants. After I encountered Chris Brookmy's book religiously when I came across "Pretty ugly ..." I was delighted to find out that this drama was commissioned. I probably had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best in this show - and not even quite fit. How can someone read a book and then adapt it to this piece of straw is outside of me. The characters are changing, situations are dropped and Parlablane sees a dramatic break that shrinks to Nesbitt. fast chin up and sliding open the bay window ... it brought tears to my eyes. I'm afraid I think what happens to "Country of the Blind" if it's a reference ... <br /> <br /> Please avoid ...
