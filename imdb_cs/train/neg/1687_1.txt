If you look at this movie, you will have anger against the movie theater, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to watch! Try to find yourself, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face on this wrong justification for the movie. It may have been more terrifying if Japanese actors just spoke in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to have fun when the film ended ... a real disappointment with all the humor in television and movie trailers that promote this fragile money maker. Sarah Michelle did not really have to act to shoot this movie ... she just practiced her foggy skills. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.
