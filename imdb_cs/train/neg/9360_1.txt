My score for this crap: 1/10 1 for technical purposes only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that makes no sense. Obviously, creating a good screenplay for film or television is almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> While it's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the greatest liars on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We must believe that people are crazy. Perhaps there was reason to believe, because 99% of the films are crappy. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the award we award the Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make movies even more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And strangely it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you want to hear this with ** t, press the super fast forward button (at least 20x).
