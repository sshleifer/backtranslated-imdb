Jimmy Dean could not be more greedy or absurdly grateful. Hysterical when we look into the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I consider to be 10. I think the view of this obese corn pig that dared in Malta would suffice to send you into vomiting if you do it far into the movie. This hideous, hysterical farce should be placed in the form of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". Such a movie like this shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc., are losing their mortgage or getting to the stones to the point of madness. It raises the question: "Who was so stupid to fund such a whale?" But then, with good judgment prevailing and "Ultimate Justice" never been, then we would not have a wonderful spoofing at Mystery Science Theater 3000!
