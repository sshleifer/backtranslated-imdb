It's hard to praise this movie a lot. CGI for the dragon was well done but lacked the correct modeling of light and shadow. The same record is also used infinitely by the dragon, which passes through the corridors, which becomes slightly protracted. I was surprised when I saw "Marcus Aurelius" in actor's credit, and he wondered what the former Roman Emperor was playing in the film! Just like "Whoopie Goldberg," it must be an alias, and someone can blame it for using it if it pops up. The story might be interesting, but the acting is flat and the direction is tedious. If you have to look at this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk when he does it - then it will be nice.
