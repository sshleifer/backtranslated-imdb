On Wal-Mart I found a DVD called "I Dream of Jeanie" in a $ 1.00 trash. When I saw that it was "the Stephen Foster story", as a musician and a music teacher, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was done because it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake in 1939 "Sewanee River". Bill Shirley's composer's portrait is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has NO testosterone and is full! I have a hard time believing that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers made him a favor by publishing their songs ... without paying them for them! In addition, the ridiculous concept is almost Raymond Middleton and his black face "Christy Minstrels" almost a 20-minute segment, played by Stephen Foster, which can hardly be seen. I can hardly believe that anyone would consider this film to be a resurrection in our present time. It's embarrassing and should be forgotten. Fortunately, the songs of Stephen Foster will NEVER be forgotten ... also that Eileen Christy's Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this low point of Hollywood history.
