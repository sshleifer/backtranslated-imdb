STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of Che films moves the story forward in the late 1960s, when a man moved his fighters into the hills of South America, he survived without enough food and water and tensions between the group. Everything comes to his head when he crosses the border to Bolivia and the government forces intensify their campaign to bring it. <br /> <br /> Without the time and place of the last movie, Soderberg's second installment focuses exclusively on action in the hills and can be even more complicated. And even more, the score was drowned, making the second installment more unpleasant air of artistic nature that turns out to be equally imitating. For a movie that never leaves, it's just an unstoppable breeze. You can not blame Soderbergh's ambitions or Del Toro's drive in the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production, things have been so disappointed. **
