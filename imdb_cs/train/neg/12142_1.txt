Please, for love of God, do not look at it. And now I say, I know what you mean, can not it be so bad? If everyone says they are as bad as they say, I have to look at it! Do not do it! It will be like watching a terrible accident involving small children and a gas tanker! You will still be bored ... the picture will never leave you! I could only look half an hour before he became violently ill. Acting is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk losing your eyes and borrowing this movie ... do not say I warned you! Envelope and plot are traps !! Zombie? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same .... right? NO!! Writing = knocking direction = garbage was causing = no action. Still not convinced? Then forever your soul will be tormented !!!
