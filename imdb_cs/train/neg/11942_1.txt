Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It starts badly and only gets worse. Katherine Heigl is a miserable mischief in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo manfully fights with what is basically a cardboard cutout character. The only member with all the enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who defends him as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. The script is terrible, it works terribly and has plot holes that are large enough to lead a two-storey bus! It's also the most sexist movie I've ever seen! The figure of Katherine Heigl is totally uncomfortable. She saw it as an evil, hopeless seduction that enticed a poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. The whole movie is supposed to be a minor, and the message that accompanies that plot simply begs the faith! Finally, he can not even redeem himself by shooting a man who apparently (ha!) Becomes demented with anger and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, redeeming himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Grapes. Do not waste time.
