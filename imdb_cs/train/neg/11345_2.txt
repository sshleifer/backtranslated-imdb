I mean the word "pedestrian". It seems the filmmakers have forgotten to have something interesting. Faith Domergue can do better than this. She is supposed to be the mysterious, revengeful goddess Cobra torn by love to Marshall Thompson (it's an idea, is not it?). Instead, she is a common home woman in the 1950s, and the only flat expression she worn throughout the movie makes me think that they made it all early in the morning before Faith drank her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so seriously "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This is a more productive land covered by Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Culture Cobra" should really be called "Cult Contractual Commitment". Why would so otherwise talented people go about the subject, though it would be a slow and predictable failure of derivatives?
