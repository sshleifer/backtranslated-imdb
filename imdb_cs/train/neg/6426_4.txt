I found a document called Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control, which is a pretty interesting document. The document contained four "mini" documents about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his work and showed his love and joy at work. The sad part, I must say, would have to be the subjects in which these people worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, then they were boring and lasted too long. The video was shot in a very creative way. I really liked the film of one piece with a voice typing. She won a great deal and also liked music.
