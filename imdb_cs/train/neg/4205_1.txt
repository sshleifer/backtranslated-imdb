ALARMIST is so humorously written that you think why an actor such as David Arquette appears on the ground agrees to be in it. It must be one of the weakest lands I have ever seen and without any humor, it borders on the brink of tiring. It comes from a terrible conclusion that seems to happen only because the director was bored and just wanted to pack quickly to get home for dinner. Do not approach !.
