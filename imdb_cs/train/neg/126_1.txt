"I'm curious: Yellow" is a fish and demanding steam pile. It does not matter what our political views are, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that's not true. I have seen R rated films with male nakedness. If they are alone, they offer only insignificant opinions, but where are R rated movies, with obvious vultures and clapping labia? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same is true for those poor cable shows: schlongs swing in the wind, but not in the clitoris. And those challenging indie films such as The Brown Bunny, where we treated the place of the stupid Johnson Vincent Gallo, but Chloe Sevigny is not a pink trail. Before beginning to cry (or imply) a "double standard" in nudity, the mental blunt should take into account one inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no sex organs on the screen when actresses appear naked, and the same can not be said for man. In fact, you generally do not see female sexual organs in American film without any pornography or explicit eroticism. This alleged double standard is less than a double standard than the certainly depressing ability to culturally cope with those women's bodies.
