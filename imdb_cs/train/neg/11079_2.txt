In the course of a few years, when I searched for half of the decent films for my children, I developed the sixth sense to record a really bold, straightforward video that is really painful, eight). I dropped on this ball, and the children spent half the film and asked me, "Why did she say that?" and "Why did he do that?" and my eyes got into the pain every minute or so that the characters really mistakenly introduced the seemingly random changes of the fences. And next time someone decides that absolutely without a sword skill is simply "bring realism" into the movie, please let them run with a boring butter knife. "Prehysteria!" his head and shoulders were above him. Arrgh.
