The effects were terrible and they got both sports bugs ....... not only that they got the wrong rules for skating but also the GIRLS Ice Hockey rules. You can not check GIRLS ice hockey. Also for someone you are not BLOCK. Not all girls are disgusting, mean and big. I'm playing hockey and I'm only 4'11 and I've been asked to go to school like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. Many contemporary girl hockey players were once the kangaroos themselves. We also skate LOT faster than you in the movie. I was embarrassed by the film that gave people the idea that we were cici ....... although I must mention that it is difficult to switch between sports because of the toe to select karst characters ..... also some of those twisting movements, which KAtelin was doing on ice you could not do in a regular hockey game. She has, in essence, suffered a person who is ill. It is also unrealistic that she will receive a HOCKEY scholarship when she has roller skates. I was really worried that a scholarship would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
