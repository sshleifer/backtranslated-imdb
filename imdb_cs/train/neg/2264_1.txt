To submit this review, I have to say I was, I guess, a bit curious about this movie. However, I probably would not have seen my arms slightly twisted. my opinion, this film shows how a man can be spoiled. In my eyes, the worst thing in this Springer phenomenon is not the kind of people who behave like they are on the "Jerry Springer Show" (which is obviously self-portrayed) but that many people are so curious and excited to be watching and hearing them about their life (yes, I think that includes me too .. to what extent is it true). If we did not believe this behavior (as some might say), at least we can mildly ruin our minds and / or be desensitized to this type of behavior. But enough soapbox (something like that). Here's Skinny: The movie has a rating of R, and while it can only deserve it (I've looked away on some scenes so I'm not quite sure), I feel that the NC-17 (the tip of the hat to another reviewer) may be a little more appropriate for a huge sexual content (a cynic could comment that the film was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre and combines the stories of a completely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks who appear at Springer's various exhibitions. Finally, the film leaves one with some resolve - and Springer's rhetoric about the need to see the real world (apparently as seen in his performance). I agree with him there - it is important to know how the world really is, so we can try to make positive changes. When I say that, let me tell you - a worldwide bad news or news story to see, but do not forget the good money to support such a sensational and perhaps formal rescue that Springer is trying to do.
