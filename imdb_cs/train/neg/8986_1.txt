THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It took me a lot to get over the movie, but this movie destroyed my house! I even finished the film and had to stop commenting on how bad this movie is. NEVER HAVE NEVER GONE! Do not spend money on this movie as a consumer. Wait for it to come out on a cable channel or something. It's hardly good TV. I really hate the movie, but this movie is sad! Hardly over porn. He should have and X ratings! A good conspiracy, some frontal nudity (if your ship is floating), but HORRIBLE college works on a level. I do not know how this movie was distributed. (It must be a contractual thing.) Indeed, if you really like watching good movies, do not waste time with this time. From one movie lover to another. WILL BE COMPLETED! Let me also say if you have experienced something like this, maybe you can concentrate and have some value for you. In that case, I say, looking at it, you can take something from it unless you just see something that happened to someone else acting (it has therapeutic value).
