Apparently if you make enough money for the actors, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he's made should go to his fans as a justification for being even associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of B films in 1950 and the effect of the rest of the cast was even worse. As to how bad the acting child was, in my opinion, he gave the second best performance. The English were terribly accentuated, and I think nobody could even speak English, but they just remembered how these words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both "alive" and real.
