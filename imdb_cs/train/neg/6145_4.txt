Although I saw "Gymkata" on the theatrical journey back in 1985, I could not remember any of that, except for the vague notions of Kurt Thomas, who ran and fought against the backdrop of stone walls and disappointment about the end. > <br /> After reading some other reviews, I picked up a copy of the newly released DVD to re-enter the Gymkata world. It turned out that this is one of the films made during the 1980s, which would go directly to the video today. Star stellar filmmaker Kurt Thomas, Jonathan Cabot, received from the blue to penetrate the land of "Parmistan" to enter and hopefully win the "The Game," a suicidal, bloodthirsty sponsored Khan that encourages people by shouting what sounds like "Yak Power. " Mission objectives include the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained, she tries to connect with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white dashes. Needless to say that Cabot finds himself in the running and fights for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to the date of destiny and the game. Star, Kurt Thomas was badly cast by director Robert Clouse, who seems to have never been on stage. The so-called script is just that incompetent. Check out more reviews for a whole range of hryvnia. The City of Fools has a few good moments, but it is eventually destroyed by a bad fit. End ... meh. Still, there is a seed of good adventure. The version in Hong Kong with more visceral events and faster tempo can even be quite good.
