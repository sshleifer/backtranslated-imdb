I have no idea what idiots gave this film Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 because it was terrible! Actually, I was watching the whole thing simply because I could not believe anyone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about acting, characters lack depth, and there is no attempt to provide any atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to shuffle 2 hours of your life by watching this movie, make sure you bring something to throw in because cinematography is just someone running around with your handheld video camera and half the time, see the main subjects. This style has been much more successful in movies like "Blair Witch" because it creates tension. There is no conspiracy and no tension in Rosetta that lends this style to anything. I should have known better when she arrived at 2 am that it would be terrible.
