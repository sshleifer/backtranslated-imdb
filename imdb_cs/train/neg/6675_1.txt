This weekend just passed, I was watching "28 weeks later", which was very good. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you it's one of the most boring so-called horrors you could ever watch. The scene was unrealistic, there was no scenario or plot. The strange creature was unreal. And combat scenes are mild compared to fighting in the schoolyard. And to make it worse, that guy named Cody had uncontrollable loose, dirty tongues that draw attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Health, Mesake C.
