Good news. 3-D is spectacularly well done and does not go into tricks. The film is based on a real story of a high point in human history and even includes one of the real participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. And now is the meat thing: It's about FLIES, for krissakes! Flies with big, googy with human eyes, true, but it's flying. Do you remember when I compared the "underworld" films to cockroach rats? It was not meant as praise, and I never felt that someone would take it literally. This one has even less empathy. Drugs? Ugh. In one of those special confusions of the Hollywood grouping, this flick was obviously on the drawing boards at the same time as the Space Chimps, as well as the creators in the universe. <br /> <br /> Go to "Apollo 13" and you will see a movie with 9 reviews of REAL space (RIP).
