This is badly done, a bad remake of the classic Bimalda paramety. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and is a distortion of the original. But one can afford a degree of creativity, but not a deceptive creativity. The acts of everyone are affected and the whole movie is fake. Shekar's paternal choice of words when exploiting Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) celebrates Lolita is quite out of place with a stream of film and character, it is quite sad senses and it was easy to avoid. Similarly, the sexual scene between Saif and Balan is quite inappropriate for film and a cheap trick that attracts the audience. When a creative work is not original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is pretty good. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene where Saif stands behind him and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. In this number, this film deserves 3 stars. Rekhy's song and dance screeches in a shout and it's needed. The song is melodic, but I remember hearing from somewhere before, and if I'm not mistaken, this melody seems to be plagiaristic. <br /> <br /> Well, they've agreed that times have changed since then. But this film does not even reflect modern times. This happens when Bollywood's modern filmmakers are becoming more enthusiastic by impressing the NRI and capturing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films end up in India and in no other part of the world.
