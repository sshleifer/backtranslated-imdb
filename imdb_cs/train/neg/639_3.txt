The clich√© of the shocking soldier home from the war is boring here. It is a shame that a great acting, acting within the bounds of its high talent, can not redeem "The Return of the Soldier" from his unwavering inability to move the viewer into emotional engagement. The best moments, as noted by another reviewer, are when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but neither Jackson's cracked good cinematographic power can pull the chests of this film out of a cold, never-warmed fireplace. Ann-Margret, the story of a sex-kitten, well-known and too often accused of lacking acting ability, finds her real and rather profound abilities unnecessary - even though she spoke with almost impeccable Middlesex accent. The Hackneyed score, sung by many of the diminutive television ministry slather-to-saccharin emotionalism, is on irritating chances with the emotional distance of the screenplay, the blocking, and the exaggerated directional formalism; with the exception of his score and the hidden scenario and direction, "The Return of a Soldier" has all the right bits but fails to work together.
