Not that I did not like childhood movies, but it was a tearjerker with little redeemed qualities. MJ Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart, and the rest of the talent was useless. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly entertaining, but he has no chance in this movie. It is a sugar-coated sugar, and anyone who is older than 7 years can hardly reach it. Check out Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
