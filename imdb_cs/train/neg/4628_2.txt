Misty Ayers had a smoky body, and that's all about this movie. Pure exploitation. I began to play with myself, counting how many times I had stocked up with orchestral music. Of course, music is not entirely related to scenes. The point at the point: He accidentally went into the room and said "Hello" was recorded with the persecution of music from the Roman epic. I want to know why the film has been sitting on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: Female low-floor panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien Movie Panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes are Misty take off with carefree clothes and wear clothes (except for bra and trousers, sadly). It also includes horrible dubbing, leading to "Watch Godzirra!" effect.
