First of all, I apologize for the fact that you have achieved even 1 review (nothing less than available). The film fails in every department, whether it's script, direction, characterization or gaming. <br /> <br /> 1) Start by saying that the name of the movie is actually a C class (even if the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries best to fulfill his character, but the weak script associated with his pathetic direction eventually makes him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar, Singh has a reward of 50,000 (which was convincing). Here in Aag it was about 100 steps to Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was defeated by our so-called heroes and he had only a few male bikes to go with all the automatic weapons.) Sholay made a Bombay movie in modern times does not seem like that convincing.4) As for Nishy Kothari, someone has to tell her she does not know how she behaves. Why is Ram Gopal Verma again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but it is not so easy for him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are forgiven in the film. 7) The legend of the role played by Lila Misra (Mausi z Basanti) in Sholay is cheaply replaced by a gang of mummies in this film. Please grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your movie. A lot of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) We should not say in the best sense about modern Jai and Veeru. Suspicion, I was shocked to see this film because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classics. Do not waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this terrible pack of silly characters, bad songs and miserable direction. Thanks, Saurabh
