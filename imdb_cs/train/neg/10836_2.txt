"Magnolia" is an absurd, awesome performance, which adds very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a purposeless series of episodes without interest in coherence. The camera goes through corridors and corridors and captures flashes of sad characters. Where is the reason for the care of these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot who can not care about others (except for John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman) and are self-destructive villains who either fall into pieces or die. It reminded me of how much I did not like "Shine" because of the irreparable father of Father Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, inalienable characters, why would we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> After "Magnolia" gives up nothing. Paul Thomas Anderson's designs are abandoned on the canvas. There are two ideas, especially a bomb. Both of them were in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One has a camera switching from one character to another while each one sings one of the Aimee Mann Folk Caf√©. Sweet, but ineffective, because we do not see what's coming together. The other idea I am referring to can not be revealed except by saying that it is completely unexpected and totally ridiculous. "Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. Especially Tom Cruise, who unleashed a performance I did not know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays in the latest recollection perhaps the most decent and really good cop. But nothing is possible. When the secret unexpected event happened, the girl behind me in the theater could no longer hold her and said, "That's silly!" I feel most of the audience agrees.
