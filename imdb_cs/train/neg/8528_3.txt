The poster is written: "He was given six years to be born at birth when he lived ... At the age of 34 he devoted himself to life." Ami is a US-born Israel who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at one year of age. At age 34, after love for 22 years of care did not work well, he decided to come to the US to turn to a doctor who said he would only have six years of his life. He wanted to show doctors he was still alive and weighing 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as me, I even saw this movie. Obviously, it is courageous to live when only his left index finger can move, but why is he so angry about a doctor who has diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that, based on medical history, people with his illness would not live long. What is the reason for the old Doctors to appear? Why is watching this old doctor in the US the way of his life? There are so many things that we might be interested in Ami's life: how can these animations do with the movement of a single finger? How can he live his everyday life while completely dependent on others? How did your doctor's predictions live? How does he emotionally balance himself when others look at him, like looking at a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything about it. Instead, the filmmaker got to the van and made a trip and let Ami show up at his old medical door to show him that he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
