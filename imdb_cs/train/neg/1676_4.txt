Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very interested actors give decent performances. The problem is who does the conspiracy? John Holmes. Infamous because of his good subsidies, a drug addict and a guy who, despite having committed AIDS, has continued to make adult movies but does not make an interesting character. The story surrounds the events leading to and the consequences of the brutal mass murder that occurred in the late 1980s in Los Angelos, to which Holmes was linked, arrested and accused of murder, and eventually freed. As in the case of the Official Journal, the guilty factor, regardless of the outcome, moved relatively high in the "He did it" zone. There is no one in this movie who is sympathetic to this film, because everyone is a suicide criminal. There is nothing interesting here.
