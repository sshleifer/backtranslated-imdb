This is the best example of a low budget that wins over what would be a good story. We bring back Samaire Armstrong (she saw how she works on the OC, I know she can do better) and then find a better scenario and budget. The special effects were so bad and mostly badly created by the computer that it almost lost me for the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And the change of Samaire Armstrong on the werewolf was made by initially reducing her to the wrong GCIF figure before she even started to change (Final Fantasy people, just like Pixar is ridiculous to think of this character as a boring Barbie Doll). The story was interesting, though the thought of blood on the werewolf is nothing new. How has it also come to balance between evil (perhaps) not so evil and the possible end of the human species if both lines were interconnected. The "Werewolf Book", which for some time had some of the other characters in a magical way, was effective, but could be expanded more by explaining what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better script and direction and I would come back again.
