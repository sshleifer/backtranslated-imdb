"Trigger Man" is definitely the most unfortunate and powerful film I've ever seen in my life. Videos from aunt's holiday are so fascinating. Actors seem to be admitted to uglypeople.com. They have no ability to act in a convincing way. They walk and walk and walk through the woods. There is more walking around than in all three parts of the "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I began to read the Porsche brochure and watched "The Human Trigger" on the way. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Total loss of time and money. I give the movie 0 stars out of 10 because it is not possible, I have to give one star.
