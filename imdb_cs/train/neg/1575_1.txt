This movie is so bad that it hurts. The car is doing 30 mph when it's about to go 100 ... a shift lever that's stuck (in Park!) Nurse who drives nearly 2 hours with a mobile phone on his shoulder ... can not any of the 2 angry get the damn phone ? There is nothing credible in this cage. I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this one!
