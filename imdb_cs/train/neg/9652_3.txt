The film was written ten years ago and another director planned it with SRK and Aamir in the lead roles. The film was finally created now that Vipul Shah directed it A Ajay and Salman to play together for decades HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) The film is falling for 90 years and the worst is gaps <br /> <br /> The film trying to pack up too many commercial ingredients and we also hav love the triangle Everything is predictable and movies too clich√© <br /> <br /> Are there gaps like how Ajay escapes from the airport in London and makes room for himself with no one? nor the way he starts his band is convincing. The other half will improve by scrambling Salman in the Ajay story, but unfortunately the peak culminates and the film ends with a bad note. Direction by Vipul Shah is common below average Music is the worst, most of the songs are average Among the actors Ajay gives his best shot though he is not convincing as a rock singer yet is great as a negative role Salman any irritating with his punjabi and talking nonsense he just impressed , when he gets a drug and on it Asin is nothing great just a piece sample Ranvijay should hold MTV Om Puri is ok
