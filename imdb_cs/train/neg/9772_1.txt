There are too many incidents of violence. The film comes from one scene to the next, and it erupts in almost every violence. Now I am not a person who is shocked by violence, and for me, a film without a fight is missing something. But, please, not one after the other. My reaction was no shock or horror, it was, "Here we go again." There's a narrative story between the scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the way through a movie that I completely shut down could not wait for the end. If this is what the best filmmakers can do, they should find something in common with their miserable lives, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
