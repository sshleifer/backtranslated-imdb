I was expecting various Sci-fi and thriller films this year, but he was so disappointed with this particular film. While some people left the movie, I decided to stay, just to laugh together with other audiences in acting, lack of tension, ridiculous ending, and difficult to follow the story. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the movie. The only redeeming of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those starring star films that they later cast. Looking back, I would not borrow at all, let alone pay more than $ 5 that I could see.
