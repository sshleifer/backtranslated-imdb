A group of forest guards and scientists go to the forest to find fossils. They fall to the Bigfoot burial site, they did not notice it. The CGI Bigfoot scenes are terrible, but it's better than the endless scenes to talk that they rarely interrupt. I thought there might be a good Bigfoot movie. But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour salt in the wound watching this movie, ONE pretty girl just is not naked once. And while this may be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (it's not a bad performance), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains "Harry and Henriksons" <br /> <br /> My class: D
