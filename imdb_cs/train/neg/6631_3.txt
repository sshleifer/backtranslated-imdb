Ram Gopal Verma proved to be a very innovative and competent director. He and Sarkar made a remake / reworking Godfather and succeeded. Dotto for Lolita, which he created as Nishaabd. Sholay is a film that repeatedly says he inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointment and finally a boring remake. <br /> <br /> Negotiations ranged from decent to very good, while Amitabh Bachchan was as threatening as the villain Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were horrible and forgotten. Meboboobian Mehboobian song was released as the second video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the tempo and dialogues - which were forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie in the theater, I found out that I'm waiting for a break and then for the end. Some viewers wisely did not have to wait and were seen to leave for the duration of the film. Finally, one of the worst movies by Ram Gopal Verma.
