You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is working at half the speed instead of full gas in the movie, and Incubus is the terrible, worst case scenario of a great actor who goes through billing proposals. In fact, when we see Hamm's scenario and the "Baroque" artistic direction of John Hougg, he can hardly be blamed. The film has something to do with a series of raped murders happening in a small town with lots of supernatural hokum. Somehow it manages to stretch tension and interest from every scene and Cassavetes seems visibly PO 'sometimes. Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well-done creature, but it is not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
