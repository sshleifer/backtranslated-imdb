This movie was terrible. I've been looking at it three times and not on the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch, the story is upset, it's depressing and totally disgusting. I do not prepare any spoilers, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, you'll see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is crappy. I saw this movie in film stores all over America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The effects are all horrible and the nakedness itself is chaffy and ugly. The other thing is that Starr Andreef's other main character was not in such bad movies in the past, in fact she was in the good ones. Just like John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
