I'm wrong, or is the version 2007 just a reflection of the original? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... bad acting, bad adjustments, etc. ... the only aspect of "exploitation" is how we've been dented for our money who buy this cache. It's nothing but light porn movies ... no real gore, no scary pictures, just cheap waste. If someone wants to see an excellent movie without the names of the actors, some slim gore and a decent story ... get Baby Blood ... also made for cheap budgets but well done ... and a real story too! I Spit was a waste of money, but I'm going to just laugh ... it's pathetic! New comment .... Sept 3 ..... I will keep this movie forever just because it's bad it's almost good .... really bad way .... worst acting at all ... real bullshit film!
