All hype! What better way to describe the film about people who are upset because they can not release their movie through their main distributor? As a result, they do it themselves. Otherwise, film humor would not justify content in the movie. The story is missing and could be short. The game is bad, but animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise do not waste your time - do not trust the hype! But if you can see the movie for free, do it. Then you will not have to waste money. Still, filmmakers are doing a good job of insisting on their story and creating crazy fools with their self-appointed miniserials. Otherwise, it is a miracle that never hit.
