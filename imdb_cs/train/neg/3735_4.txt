Actress Patty Duke wrote about her acting career, her crazy love life and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost forever turned her away, a totally funny and fun book. With this rich material from which he draws (and Patty is playing in the final act), he would think that some cracked television director, like Gilbert Cates, could bring them together in the movie, but "Call Me Anna" is the pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the hidden narrative (skidding ahead of time) is not absorbed, we will never allow ourselves to become aware of what is going on, and production seems to be ending with a low budget. Actors are the point and the value that the Duke himself will eventually emerge is not paid - the fake reality of the film is so dense that Patty can not bring stability to the script. The producers seem to have been so honest (and conscious) that they stealthily directed the film for the perfect diagnosis and spiritual freedom of the Duke, but left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
