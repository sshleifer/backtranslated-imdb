What a complete disappointment! Score 6.1 here on IMDb has created some mild expectations, but, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing I'm thinking about is brains, stereotypical university kids. Yes, I know that teens can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed as filthy in the movies? There was one character I thought was ok but he (and not revealing it here) was killed before the trip. The other characters were badly executed and even the supposed hero / heroine did not do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is quite good and the productions evaluate the frame above for this kind of flicks. Acting in general was not very good, Rutger Hauer performs in a small role. But it all fails with lingering and braindead characters. After 10 minutes, you stop taking care of them. 4/10 (and that's generous).
