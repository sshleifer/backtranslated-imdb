Still so bad that the lowest that can go does not matter. Otherwise, it would simply be zero. I'm really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, it was not Peckenpah's name that I would never have thought he did. Actually, one of the people in San Francisco who I know was a lot on a set and almost exhausted says Sam was just blind. It shows it in spades. The laughing piece in the early part of the film is the only thing in this whole disorder behind the second form. Even Gig Young is not observable. This is a real test of masochism. If I were forced into the theater boundary to see it, I would jump. And now I really feel guilty when I was watching all of the boundaries of a very comfortable couch that was too nice to leave. What mess, they seemed less written than made when they went together. It's not just a bomb but a bum. Yikes !!!!!
