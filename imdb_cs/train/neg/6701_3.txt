For many years I have been an ecologist and I really enjoyed this show. I had to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn a few great new things. I suppose I could, if I could get to Rachelle. I'm sure a lot of this is introduced to look like a reality show and appeal to this class of viewers. It does not work for someone who really wants to improve the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. Because Ed is such a great font of information, maybe the second show, which is really serious about the environment, a good idea. For some of us, it is not necessary to do things down. <br /> <br /> I'm no longer recording episodes or watching a show, but let me know if a real green show can be in the works.
