They were doing me to watch it at school, and it was terrible. The film is obsolete. Episodes become confusing because reality is associated with fiction to make the story more interesting. Teachers talked about it as a treatment, but it really was a painfully boring experience. I read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them do what they do in a real-life movie. This explains that cheese works very often. Very often, this story becomes slightly outrageous and far-reaching. I do not like how some lines were written, and he wanted them to make more sense to them. Although it was written as educational, funny, exciting and hip, it ended up as boring, dry, far-reaching and old. I hope no one will have time to watch this movie because you would be fine if you did not see it.
