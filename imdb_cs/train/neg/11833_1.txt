So do not even think about renting out shops because it's really a bad movie. Do you think JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, the rat is flushed out of the toilet and somehow must get back. Fans of a terrible "Shrek" can look forward, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" are likely to turn away. So why did not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For AARDMAN? !! It is clear that Aardman has melted while leaving Dreamworks to do the whole thing. Bad, bad, bad! Almost every character is terrible, except the weird frog that is right for the movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with the borehole watching this movie. No, wait, I actually fell asleep with the boredom watching this movie. It's scary. Fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek".
