I found a film offensive for Americans who lost someone in towers, for American people in general. To pretend that in the past years it has been a tribute to frightening facts, every director uses the opportunity to argue with old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack) or criticizes American political behavior or compares the different political situation of their own countries that have nothing what to do or participate in the atrocities of September 11th.
