This film, which was once stunning for its thoughtful politics and the display of free love and sexual liberation, has been truncated for mere curiosity. It seems absurd when this mostly boring little film has banned and captured governments in many countries. Considering how finally socialist Sweden happened, the "radicalism" of its policy, once it is controversial, seems naive and almost four decades later. And her sexual scenes, suddenly the subject of sensational obscene exams, look quite refined in a modern context. However, the film and accompanying documentary films, detailing many controversies and influences, remain marginally observable as the early relics of the 1960s. One part of the film that is still holding: its self-esteem with respect to the "fourth wall". Every moment the filmmakers are filming. Satirical playfulness still raises laughter.
