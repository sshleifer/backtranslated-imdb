.... CAUSES HIS CROP! The kind of movie that makes you go and squeeze the film maker and say "WHY?" Poor camera work ... counts the time the camera tries to stay stable on one person and can not. Dialogue is ridiculous. The game is comic. They seem to have taken the western city to the west to find out if they could make a film about the smallest amount of money. I bet that $ 10 used home video cameras to do it. Either that or most cameramen were drunk. Really trailers are more fun than movies. If you ever wanted to host the "Worst Film Party", bring this. Want more fun ... stare at the wall.
