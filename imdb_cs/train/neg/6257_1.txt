SPOILS. Spectators with magnificent tastes viewed this film. Allow me to add balance by pointing to the following: <br /> <br /> Scenario: Dreadful. When Tom and Dan "know each other", no matter what the movies are talking about, the speech is obviously about one person, and I suspect it was a director who carefully worded the words to sound intelligent. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard about the HIV virus?" and it sounds about as natural as if you were asking, "Did you communicate with nine other races?" Appearing: White teeth are doing and the carved face does not have a sensitive face. Speedman did well with what was given to him, I think, but Marsden was terrible - incomprehensible, incredible and totally complacent and charming throughout his capture. It's the emptiness of his performance (also see Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Spare me! Moments of flight were not exciting, but irritating and weak. Remember that Marsden pretends to test the keys in the door and then throw them out: "They are not working, man!" Tee-hee. And remember the semi-black-and-white flashbacks that are triggered by some kind of sound taken from the CSI and other crime scenes. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, the evil and the offensive, is the homophobia (external or internal that you decide) in a movie in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have taken a condom or not at all - excuse me where Tom was when they had sex? There is some villain by inserting a partner who comes out as a naughty gay person in general. <br /> <br /> In summary: Attention!
