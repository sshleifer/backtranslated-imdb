For comedy writer Woody Allen he really leaves the audience pay that this lethal attempt to develop character. There are several fun moments, but no more than one would listen to their tumble dryer breaking a tennis ball. Will Ferrell loses his time in this movie, which can not show off his usually funny supplies. Amanda Peet did well, but she did not have room again to move in this otherwise dead movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can not be worn, but if wearing it, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that go on in one scene and really do not do anything just to show that their author can write a few lines of skilful dialogue on the occasion, then you will love the movie.
