There are bad movies, horrible movies and boring movies ... I can watch the most and put them to the end, not this time. Avoid it like a blow, annoying music in the whole text, horrible editing, no comedy, her story but news ... My lover wanted to see that he thought it would be legally blonde material or something similar to observable, but never better than average, chick. It's the first time she'd begged me to press the stop button. Girls, well, they were not great to start (Denise did OK in Starship Troopers and Wildlife) but you sank the gravel. I feel like a cup that spent 30 minutes in this ... Pamela Anderson is almost undetectable after many building works on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take your advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells by dressing up the full coins on the screen.
