This movie succeeds in being one of the most unique movies you have ever seen. But this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails of this mess. It seems to be a series of problems that are designed to see if you are willing to come out of the movie and give up the money you have just paid. If you do not want to feel honest, you will sit through this terrible movie and develop a real sense of compassion for the actors involved, everyone has seen better days, but then you realize that they actually got paid enough money to do it and you lose them regret as you already done for the movie. I can not go on with this terrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would do, and in that case it would be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You have begun to sit open a dialogue you have never seen / heard, this thing should take five minutes. Moreover, this is narrated, which suggests that the viewer can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines is up and running, it's like working only to get the lines to the line of poster tags. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, whom I usually love) and doing the best before drowning, but eventually doing it. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid plays a smart role, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress, and somehow she is still born in movies, in my opinion she should stick to American cake movies. <br /> <br /> Everything in everything you would like to see yourself when it appears on the video, I know I kicked it out, I think we can all be honest, conjure up the shortcomings of others.
