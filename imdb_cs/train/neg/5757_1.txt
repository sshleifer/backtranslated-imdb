The movie was observable while Nicolson was on the screen. But I had to fight the exhaustion of boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep to carry scenes without Jack; she was as gentle as she could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters were rendered earlier - and much better. It seemed to me like a real life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and it is not worth writing or watching. Why did Ephron feel that her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein is so interesting that he talks about my escape. Maybe she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting episodes of their lives on paper is cataract. Well: But why did anyone in Hollywood feel that this story is worth shooting is a mystery to me.
