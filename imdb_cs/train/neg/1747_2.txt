It starts with a nice note just to collapse quickly and be expected. <br /> <br /> Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) characters are not properly built before Mac's boss decides. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem to be forced. About casting, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was unnecessary in the role of the moody chef. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad and is still struggling with furniture, and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving mercy in the movie. <br /> <br /> The other half of the movie is fun sometimes, but in all DUDs (songs are boring) and the main release if you are hoping for some fun and comedy.
