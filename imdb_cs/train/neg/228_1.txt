I thought it was a new movie in New York: wrong! It's a bit of a British countryside. I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because after the story becomes completely "abracadabrantesque", a symbolic word for the French presidential mandate. This means that close to nonsense and motives would want to bring a sincere feeling. Which was? Perhaps, good duo actress: Yes, I know, they're three friends, but the cop in the red hair is a little invisible to me. A tall doctor surprises her strike, and McDowell delivers gentle talk as usual, all in a soft, soft and almost mute attitude. This subtlety guessed me because, like other artists or directors, the same pattern is repeated over and over again. In her case, it seems that regardless of the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, living with infinitely different stories. I still do not know how to set a limit (or fusion) between artists and works. Another positive aspect of this film is its feminine touch and interesting distinct views. Women each have their own way of life, even though they are all free. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning how to hear how the same and unique reality can be perceived in many ways, such as people. Eventually, the film is quite visible, but the great end cuts the desire for another vision.
