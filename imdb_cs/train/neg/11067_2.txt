I'm a big fan of the real crime genre, but I could not sit down over this ruined piece. It was almost as if Dahmer had intended it as erotic as a porn-flick soundtrack. There was no view of what Dahmer did ticking, nor of looking at who was his victims. Nothing but "See how ghastly that guy is." And I have to give the creators so much - their Dahmer is the most precious thing that has ever defied the screen.
