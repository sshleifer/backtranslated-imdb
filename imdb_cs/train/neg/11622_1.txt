Dave goes through divorce and his mind returns to the first love. "Wanders" is probably not a word. I should say she is holding on to her past girlfriend. She remembers the day the relationship ended. Only vague transitions are missing in the senile sequences. He kindly reminds his favorite songs and places where they went. I'm not an advisor, but maybe it had something to do with an unsuccessful marriage ??? Dave goes to the support group and meets the hemisphere (also divorced) who, rather than being "off" by his cowardice, has become interested in him. Did I mention how Dave is creepy? Sometimes he recalls himself in a third person. He does not move his hands when he walks. It's weird. Too short a story, Dave tells him to find Mary (an old friend of Galla) and kill her ... err ... I mean confront her. He does it. Which was really scary. She believes she's got married, she's still flying across the country to meet her. She gives up her house to make sure she's alone before she "enters" her. He has a disturbed conversation that ends with sharing the Gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to a new young girlfriend. We liked the film primarily because of unintentional comic value. I still enjoyed the girls' impressions ... "I heard another song Dave & Mary!"
