Could anyone stop John Carpenter from constantly and deliberately spoiling his reputation? How deep can you drop? It seems that this man has lost all self-esteem. This episode looks like it's a movie student, not even worth talking about what's wrong, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent as the filmmaker or without any motivation ... Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please immediately retire with the rest of self-confidence and stop pouring the bins like this in a bad tradition of escaping from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Let yourself be drunk.
