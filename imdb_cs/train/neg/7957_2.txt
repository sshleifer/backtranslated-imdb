Who. In two cities we have a station that shows "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. This night's film was Carrie Fisher's "She's Back" movie about a really annoying woman who eventually murders her when her robbers come to her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns back to her husband's fear. He wants to try to avenge his killers, and he's "back". And he will not let him rest until he does it. He's always irritating ... even audiences! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). Throughout the movie, I shook my head and wondered who thought it would be a good movie. Bea is so unpleasant. The story is stupid; negotiations are bad; story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - really a really bad movie, check out this. You will not be disappointed. Hey.
