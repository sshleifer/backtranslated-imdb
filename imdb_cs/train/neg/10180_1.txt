This film is a shame for the main franchise league. I live in Minnesota, and I can not even believe they drove Cleveland. (Yes, I realize the real Indians were pretty good and the Twins have taken their place on the bottom of the American League, but they were still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, liked the second and always enjoyed the third when the Indians finally set out up to the series. You can not tell me this is not a plan after the end of the second film. What happened? Anyway, if you are your true fan of the original Major League, do a favor and do not look at this waste.
