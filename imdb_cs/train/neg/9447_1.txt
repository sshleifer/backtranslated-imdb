Most movies I can easily sit on, even if I do not like the movie. I'm a type of person who recognizes great movies even though I do not like this genre. This is the first movie I could not stand. The cat in the hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The game is fine (Myers is good as a cat, it's just that it's really unpleasant). The silly songs that the cats sing are boring and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The plot stretches further and further, and the audience must suffer a bad conversation. "Funny" parental notes are disgusting, not fun (I remember a horrible commentary on how garden hoes compare, what kind of people people call "ho"). Even though the film is really short, FOREVER seemed to be taking it. Do not waste time. I know little kids who hated this movie. If children can not stand, I do not know how some adults can. I would like to smoke more about this movie, but I do not even feel like I've long known that I wrote about it. I did not kick it! So in summary, you do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching it! Check out a good movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever shot.
