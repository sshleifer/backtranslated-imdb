Despite being a 2001 film, it is the direction of the 90th artistic styles that were considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. Cheese cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is pretty decent and a few scenes captivated me a little (like a taxi driver bringing her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective who killed the sister and how he was obsessed with suicide was just terrible. The performance of an actor who plays a married friend, Selma Blair, is really worrying me. However, I have the whole thing, which is rare for this type of random film, what it is - the movie is on TV and you decide to watch.
