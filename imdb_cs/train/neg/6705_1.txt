This movie is just a pity. Orlando, Florida seems to become a more acclaimed film area (like Vancouver's prominence). The brothers were shot in central Florida, and this short film is a bit of an obstacle to the area (which made great strides with India's Walking Through Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth to the Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as truthful as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place for the Brothers movie. It had the potential to give a new shot to the madness of the "Boy Band". After all, N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area as well. But the Brothers are probably weak due to the weak script. Both of the main characters are flat and almost no development (some of them could be amateur actors, but surely this is certainly the way the script was written). Also the problem is the choice of jokes. Many jokes are too repetitive (they like it for the first time, but it's a little boring). Some "concert" scenes are misplaced (and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story in any way). I had great hopes for this, but unfortunately disappointing. I also hope that the best for the upcoming feature based on this short one. But I think the best for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his strong suit. It is undisputed that he is certainly one of the most important creators in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he is now infamous, not famous). <br /> <br />
