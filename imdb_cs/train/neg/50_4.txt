Three parts of a "horror" movie with a guy in the house who invited the viewer not to go "outdoors" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove why. The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who encounters two psyches. This leads to two completely foreseeable changes. Yet it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well-done and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable. The second way involves a man escaping the theft of a large amount of money. His car breaks down, is attacked by a dog and hits a nearby clinic. DISPLAYED, poorly finished and extremely slow. Even after 30 minutes it's too long. Good actor though. <br /> <br /> The third is hardly a horror story. Includes a beautiful, lonely woman looking for the truth. She has beautiful scenes, a nice erotic feeling and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even frightening. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth watching first, but that's all. Tune in and turn it off.
