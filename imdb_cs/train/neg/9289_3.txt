for those of you who were desperately trying to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, there is your chance and then go back to the real world. The one who hid the gold in the first film told Twitch, so he takes over to the next prison where he wrestles with the Champs to look around. Twitch plans to leave prison for a month to get the gold and start living with him. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is captured in all of them, so they move with him and find her and Twitch's wife. As you can imagine, acting is under steam, it's a lot (really annoying) rap music and badly modified combat scenes. On the plus side, it is that the Hispanic guys who play in all the jail / action / thriller he has ever done, keep the door shut. It's not too dizzy, but at least it's harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a huge fan of the original, it's ok. <br /> <br /> If not, you were warned.
