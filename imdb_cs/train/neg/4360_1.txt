First let me say that I have to think a lot about how to write a comment for this movie. The best reviews for this kind of cinema can be just silence. Film addressed to households and grandmothers. This movie is trying to look "real" and characters should be considered "real people". The Italian could never think that the characters could be "real": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. This gives a very confused view of what life is in the Italian countryside. The plot is weak (conspiracy, what plot?) No humor is made by anyone older than 12 years old.
