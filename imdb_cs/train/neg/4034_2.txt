Oh dear. good writing, but writing and managing them art and writing a joke, and a straight joke is a bit of a challenge. Even if you're doing a good comedy, you have to get the time and the moment right. I do not show it all where I laughed, but it was very little. My main focus was on a fast, fluent dialogue that caused some people in the movie to be poisonous. When reading a script in your head it may sound great, but get it out and another task in the camera. Handheld camera work delivers energy to just a few parts of the film. The overall direction was good, but the script was not for me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head that sounds good. Excuse me.
