can a movie become naive? you can not believe it is part of this scenario. and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the fence and the end of the first 10 minutes. the main actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she does not do it, the doll has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ease that the character passes and stays in aa Music School makes a ghost of an opera novel looks like a historical biography. I used to even comment on the depth of the character, but the only good thing about the film is Madsen's performance that can bring life to the meli-like one-dimensional figure. The film is so deep that it sticks to the teeth. I think some 13-year-old Britney-obsessed girls are shouting "Oh, give us a break! If we want fairy tales, Brothers Grimm is always hidden in the attic." I gave her 2nd place instead of Virginia Madsen.
