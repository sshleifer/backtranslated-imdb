I've read some good reviews that have defended and criticized various aspects of this film. One thing I see again and again is the inconvenience with Megan, an idealistic politologist trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I am 23 years old student of political science and I think that I will change the world, so they relate to Megan. Besides, she's cute. She is not a super model, but more cute girls next door. OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It's very dramatic and it seems to be exaggerated, but does not fit her character? He will perform this show with the intention of sacrificing his life to prove it. He thinks people who have such a show are sick. I think she has argued very well. Of course, she's a young naive girl, she's afraid of what she's going to face. I think her acting is exactly portraying a young girl who shows moral courage despite stunning fear. In addition, I think she has retained some dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation in which she has appeared. Regarding the film in general, except Megan, it was almost what I expected. She had excellent gore scenes, according to micro-budget standards. This plot might have made a quick idea, almost no meditation. It's basically just a dark humorless nonsense movie slasher, which name suggests. I love the sadism of a doctor. He'd still ripped Megan's shirt, not just because of what had happened, but also because he was bothering her to kill her. The chain bun was cheerful. For lovers of Slasher films he was probably the best character. I give this movie 4 out of 10. It had good setup, almost no conspiracy and a mix of good and spooky games. I would recommend it for cheap excitement, but barely a rough diamond, which is a micro-budget horror.
