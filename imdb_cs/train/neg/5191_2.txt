Oh, boring t.v. shows and pilots who were hit in the 1970s to be equally boring t.v. movies! Some examples could be "Driving with Death" (the most hysterically bred lot), "Stranded in Space", San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confused) and this magical magic of Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (though you would not know it from outside shots), it's probably an unsuccessful pilot for a dirty spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the silly main character Diamond Head, who seemed to be half asleep for the whole movie; his boss "Teta Mary," who had a really strange delivery of his rows and scaly white hair, as well as a tan that looked as though it was stucco; Diamant Head girlfriend / co-worker (hell, I can not even remember her name), a skinny, wooden woman with a flat-talking way that is not just sexy or interesting; and the singer Zulu (again I do not remember his name), which was not bad in small doses. The most intriguing person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who seized as a bad guy, but he still managed to make his chore. In addition to using this so-called "Chameleon" to mask, it was just ridiculous. I have no idea what he is doing or trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American dictator as an American general. And that does not interest me. This conspiracy was simply not interesting enough to catch you even ten minutes at a time, let alone an hour and a half or so. Simply call this - Hawaii five not!
