The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me that I was the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not think it would be possible to overcome my list of bad b-movies, but that deserves gold. Its not funny. It's a bad deal, it's badly shot and the story is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that she has three girls in it. I really believe that this film has the potential to tap another Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the most famous Danish film ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
