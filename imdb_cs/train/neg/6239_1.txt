Where was his criticism of democratic administrative and republican? After all, he served for 17 years and more in a government where his influence was not willing. Oh, I forgot about eight years when he was second at the headquarters of the strongest nation on Earth. The film is happy to show the footage of young senator Gore, who asks why the NASA scientist was forced to change his conclusion in his scientific paper, but he could not ask Clinton / Gora for global warming. Probably too close to the election year or maybe it would hurt Hillary in '08. In any case, he is a politically cowardly and party man with a hot end. It does not provide any criticism of consumption, criticism of capitalism, no way of history of industrial development that led us to this point. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film was much more about Mr. Gore than about the real problems facing our environment. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to do a campaign movie - cut it down and tell him what it is.
