Not exactly my genre, it's a direct fight against a street street fight that I've met only with a friend who gave it while we had a couple of beers. I'm quite open and a good fan of Eamon Walker, so I sat back to enjoy myself. Blood and Bone is a story about Isia Bone, ex-con, who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons that eventually unfold when the movie continues. Blah bla bla. What a tedious movie. I understand that such films rely heavily on the conspiracy, but must be in such a stupid, predictable and utterly stupid storyline? Maybe it's not important, but it's bothering me with a bare rubber. Better no plot and pure action than the boyfriend fleb mongrel story. With a totally unreasonable and unstoppable sentimental drive engine, it is the film equivalent of a turmeric turkey filled with rotten guts. I should probably mention at this point what is, of course, a drawing of the film: fighting. Even in itself, the struggle is rather poor. Bone managed to break out of troubled street fighters in single strike instruments (big astronaut or two are a sad attempt by the creators to correct this incoherence); fighters who are never interested in the conclusion that they are attacking each other are stupid. Even this is repetitive and stupid, his hands broken and his face kicking with steady alacrity that we meet again and again. <br /> <br /> Running a mill, a film based on movie numbers that deserves its full right to DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen over and over again. And not particularly good.
