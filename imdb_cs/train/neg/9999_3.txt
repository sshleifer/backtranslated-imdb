This is the movie that contains my enemies that I watch all the time, but that's not bloody truth. I watch it only once in a while to make sure it's as bad as I thought it was for the first time. Some mobsters have kidnapped Boeing 747. (This is at least an improvement, Boeing is imprisoning a good part of the Pentagon.) The aircraft breaks down in the Bermuda Triangle and drops under pressure to the bottom, which is a certain post-facto submarine. He has one of those star casts, the stars either fall or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are on our own!" says pilot Jack Lemon. It is so right. Except for George Kennedy. He is in all these movies with a disaster. <br /> <br /> Instead, watch the next movie. Oh, not "airport" the original. This is not good either. Instead, watch the decent movement on stuck airplanes like "Phoenix flight".
