Seriously. It is one of the deepest family exhibitions of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot - a family without a mother and 3 "dad" pick up 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The creators of this show really want you to hate characters, right? <br /> <br /> That's why I do not think anyone should watch this show. I was just praising the whole show and I think instead of the lethal injection all criminals should be forced to watch this show, torture much worse than anything else. 1.5 / 10 or D
