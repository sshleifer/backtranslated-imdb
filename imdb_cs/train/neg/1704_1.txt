You would not expect such a movie to be good and not. It's not a budget, an extremely violent zombie movie shot by a camera that looks bad ... and it's funny. The actors have apparently never before acted and are showing up in their horrible, cheerful readings. There is no plot that could be seen. A small conspiracy I found seemed to have fled the government's experiment and the group of zombies seems to be a terrorist couple. The effects of gore are actually some of the worst I've ever seen. It seems that gore effects people attack the butcher for all parts of the body and many scenes include zombies that break down people and eat their organs. It's a fun movie, and it's as bad as you can get from any movie point of view. My Rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
