When HEY ARNOLD! first came to the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite performances. Then the same episodes began to show up again and again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stop watching it. I was a little surprised to hear about HEY ARNOLD! FILM because it does not seem to be as popular as some of Nickelodeon's other cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Still, I had nothing better, but I also went to see the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect much. I just expected it to be a silly film version of a cartoon like the RECESS movie. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid childhood movie and nothing more. There and there were some good parts, but for the most part the film was stingy. Just for kids.
