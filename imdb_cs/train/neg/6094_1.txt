I was pretty much convinced that I'm writing this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen 2) If you can not make more reviews, it will not be included in the list of all the worst movies - which deserve to be 3) I was happy - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for Â£ 15. YOU DO NOT PAY so much for this movie! You will be very angry. 4) In the horror genre there are a lot of movies that in my opinion do not give a fair rating and give this film a higher rating than a criminal summary summary: a guy without a friend meets a tramp that promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else as someone else. Our hero is surprisingly transformed into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings and sitting on a baby saddle. He will kill them one by one until they are tracked and found by the police. Why is it so bad? The beginning of acting is very bad. Somebody else compared it to school production. No, this is worse than any acting I've seen on the school scene. I bought some of these previously forbidden movies from vipco DVD and was not as disappointed as I was. well, acting is bad, but the film can not deliver in any other sense. What was the reason for shooting this movie when there is no gore! OK, no gore. What else can this movie offer? Breats? No, not even any details! It is true that this film may have some charm in its unique diesel, but any potential buyer / observer of this film should be fairly cautioned that this film is at best only one in ten.
