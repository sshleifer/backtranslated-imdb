I bought this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music. I was also a great fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very stylish after Barak, with wide angles, very similar to cameras set to capture long passage time in each frame. Even some scenes were the same (street with traffic). While Baraka narrated a great story, adjacent to nature, artificially created environment, spirituality and the horrors of the world, in a gorgeous way and great music, this film just jumped from shot to shot without any story, average score and then. ... POOF, it's done! I thought there had to be a mistake! History of the World? Half of the film is Egypt and the landscape (looks like Arizona, but it did not matter to control). Serious people, it's terrible, borrowing them if necessary, but do not buy them. Movie players should be shamed for doing it.
