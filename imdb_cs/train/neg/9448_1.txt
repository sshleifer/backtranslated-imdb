No redemption, this film is waste. His jokes do not begin to be funny. Children's humor is pathetic, and attempts to reach adults only add to the sadness of the whole miserable package. Sitting in it with my children has caused me the inconvenience of what might follow. I could not enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was purchased enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters had much interest in seeing it again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. Frequent requests for repetition.
