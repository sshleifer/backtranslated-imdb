I often comment on the absolutely terrifying real scary movies on the market, and sadly the White Noise served only to reduce my belief that the film industry remains capable of such efforts. I was surprised that I was getting more exhausted as the conspiracy worsened and my static headache increased. The white noise I found was absurd to our best efforts to stop infidelity. Even after I witnessed the heavy suffering suffered by Michael Keaton, I was completely unaffected by his extinction. Until the credits, I waited hard for anything - anything ... essential to join the story of the characters, but that kind of relief never came. Sure, there were occasional moments of a heart-stopper, but just because the loud noise tends to do that to the audience. While acting was lame, Michael Keaton probably played his most powerful role to date. Perhaps the only redeemable quality White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both Keaton's dwellings. Total white noise leaves one with a morbidly depressing perception that those who die are trapped in a world that is guarded by three shadowy shadows, trying to revive their livelihood and follow the dead on their own graves.
