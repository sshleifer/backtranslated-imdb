I know I'm in a minority but ... Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not a toad; just a frog. It reminds about a hundred other non-talented hackers who refute one unnecessary bull after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's a crazy fest. Slater's talent is only minimally used, leading to other things (like his unsuccessful relationship). Reid appears as if she has forgotten her acting hours, has been seriously hit in her head and MADE has forgotten her acting hours or has one of the worst directors in the history of the film. I am voting on the third choice, alone, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done one thing from which I have the least pleasure. Frankly, I'm pleased to have done that smell. I was concerned about Bloodrayne's contestants about "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now I'm convinced that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I do not think anything you're worried about. <br /> <br /> It scores 1.0 / 10 ratings for this dirty, complicated crap-fest, from ... <br /> <br /> Attachment :.
