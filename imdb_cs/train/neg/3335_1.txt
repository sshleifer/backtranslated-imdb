This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the series and is a positive proof that a five-minute fable is not a feature film. Poor Sid Caesar as a futile emperor is obviously so stupid, it's hard to watch him. Robert MORSE as a sober tailor does not have a charming spell. Not even his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) "Songs" are horrible and slow down just what is happening by plotting. The direction is virtually non-existent, and very few support features are added. Lyseth Anthony is quite the emperor's daughter, but her voice was apparently nicknamed, a fate shared by a number of smaller players. And the film crawls at the speed of the snails. Hans Christian Andersen had to turn his cakes in his tomb when it appeared. It can be honest, at least from this film story, it's no surprise that it was straightforward to forget the video.
