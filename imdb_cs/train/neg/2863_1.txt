I enjoy watching this movie for free because I work in the hotel industry and this movie has recently appeared in our film library. Nothing against low budget films, but this movie has horrible acting and direction. How can a movie be created? The director should be on the black list and for all the poor actors, it's definitely not a bouncing board in his career. Make sure that this movie will not watch that acting is a lame, camera and it's going horribly. There are only a few other films that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example could be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give it to charity, so at least for good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would watch for another 10 (or at least one more time).
