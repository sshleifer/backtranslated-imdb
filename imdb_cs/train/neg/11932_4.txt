Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he saw Gruner, what he said was a pretty good science fiction movie, Nemesis. So, when we watched it, we found out that we had a quick run through BS drama to get into incredible action sequences. Gruner loves kicks and kicks and kicks. And dig! haha <br /> <br /> The Gruner character is a postgraduate student who is forced to stay in the ghetto near the one he grew up in. She finds herself looking at the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join a Mexican gang that keeps a torturing family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the guy to defend himself (against the gang - too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills all (or is badly maimed) and tries to get rid of his block of these gangmembers. The plot was very shabby and easy to think. Gruner is probably not well known for his screenplay if this film compares to possible options. This ghetto is pure hell, and I like to see the Scandinavian crew going through the characters as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. Music was typical of action music (piano piano and tympani, terrible guitars) that were not really as bad as I did. The director really needed not to keep the action, instead of interrupting a nice family moment every five minutes. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave him 4/10 because he really tried to be an average action movie for Oliver Gruner to play in the film but the overall feeling of the film leaves you wanting to close down what you just saw.
