The Labor Comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating the eccentric farm family in Maryland, who never paid her taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of a farmer who pushes the impoverished tax man. Debbie certainly made her share in lower theater situations during this period - and this is no better or worse than the others. The picture starts bright, but the half-way flags become furious and unimpressive. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself will defeat chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad sound combination that caused all the actors to sound as if they were stuck in the echo chamber. ** z ****
