The second attempt by the intellectual of New York in less than 10 years to create a "Swedish" film - the first is "brother Carl" Susan Sontag (who was created with Swedish actors in Sweden!) Results? Oscar Wilde said it was best for Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop: "One would have to have a stone heart to laugh aloud about the death of Little Nell." That's the same thing. The "Interiors" are full of solemnly drawn warriors. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Mid-range view: "I do not like who I am.") Bergman's quotes (using a polite term) are close to parody. The incredibly involved family still remembers how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I've read so much my poem - it was - I do not know - The New Yorker." "Oh, that was an old poem, I've reworked it.") Far from that, I found them quite cheerful. Most of the dialogue is just like funny stuff from previous films by Allen - only he directed his actors to play straight. When he did not get into the movie, Mary Beth Hurt had a bad copy of all her wallpapers, intonation, and neurotic habits, and transformed her into a tough substitute (similar to Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - a dysfunctional family with a silent native mother - appears to be more or less lifted from Bergman's "Winter Light," a basic family melodrama that is undermined by a lot of existential anxiety. Everything comes in business visual / audio tricks: deafening paper scratching on a pencil, towering surf that dwarfs walk to the beach. etc .. <br /> <br /> The later "serious" films of Allen are less embarrassing, but also much less fun. I'll take the "Interiors". Woody seldom makes a fun movie.
