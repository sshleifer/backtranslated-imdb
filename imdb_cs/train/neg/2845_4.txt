This film descends from the fourth to the first without bothering with the third or the other, grinding devices up to the sappy, b-film target line. Con is simply the best and smartest part of the movie at the beginning. It's worth seeing. The Harlow scene in the bathtub appears so fast it may be missing. It's definitely not worth noting that Robert Osborne in his TCM introduction has given this bad to bad confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposedly marginal society will prove to be saints - especially incredible nature, Al. I wonder if he's working for me in Cincinnati?
