We had a STARZ free weekend and turned on the station to see what was going on. It was this film Howling II: The game was terrible, but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I was very laughing at the few scenes I've seen. My friends are wondering why I never want to go to horror movies. If they saw this movie, they knew why. I should be thrown out for laughter so hard. Just a few commentary trivia: Reb Brown who played Ben White starring American captain in Made for TV movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiration for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick certainly has a great taste for women.
