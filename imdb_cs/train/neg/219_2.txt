it could be a good film if he explored something more interesting than the surface of a lesbian relationship if it was the sense of the film ... it is quite predictable without mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian tATu group. ..chance? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this movie that would support him, so they had to use something already known. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role is. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not actors (such as Mihaela Radulescu). So summarize it: "girl band tatty" + desperate / publicity needing "actors" + non-existent fence + opportunity to use bad tongue to shock = love sick ... too bad ... thought was good, though ... and seriously I keep from commenting on the title ...
