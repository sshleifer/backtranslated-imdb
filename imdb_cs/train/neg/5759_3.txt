This is the third parody of scary movies and perhaps the last. This time spoof is mainly on the ring, sign and 8 miles for some strange reason. In my opinion, this film was very unnecessary and unnecessary and even fun. I laughed maybe three times, and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this was just stupid. If your jokes consist of slaughtered corpses and people are constantly defending things, this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough at home and you save money, and please stop making such movies, it only gets worse 3/10.
