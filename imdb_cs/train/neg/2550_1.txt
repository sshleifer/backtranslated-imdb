It was the "American Pie Tradition" label, which made me cheat for this movie. What I get is a piece of Jackass junk, with the main difference that compared to this Jackass the movie looks like Citizen Kane. This movie fouled me that I rewarded other films 1 in 10, because now I can not go under it. This one makes pretty bad movies like cinematographic performances. Actually, I turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I rarely did. But it was simply plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. I can not believe that some people really reward 10 out of 10. What do your parents do? Let go of your head when you were just a kid? Or was it the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare with it? Are you always virgin and you have everything you think? At least something must be wrong. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay out of this. Even if you're in the mood for a simple film that does not require thinking, choose something else or you are surely sorry.
