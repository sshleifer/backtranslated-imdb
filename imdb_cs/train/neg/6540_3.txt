I can not believe that so many people compare this film to Argento. His work is much more imaginative and worse - and much more fun. The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. Murderous scenes-and let's say what's on this genre-are not interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer is, and I really do not care when it's revealed. Cinematography is not memorable, and the very gentle Gothic atmosphere of the 19th century simply did not find me. Some actors are pretty good (especially a director and a sadistic girl who is promoted to younger students), but "Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but amazing, they add very little spice or tension. If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
