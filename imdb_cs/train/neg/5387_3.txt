At one point when it seemed interesting, it never happened there. People move from one point to another point without it (if one was very boring). There was no action, no tension or horror, and the characters were quite heartless, so they did not happen what had happened to them. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was quite boring. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 3/10. I liked it was not a shattered friend's job, and if there was music, it did not ruin me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrible.
