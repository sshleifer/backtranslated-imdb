Normally, I would not write a comment online, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it shot as a soap series ("Young and Unrest" is actually shot by professionals compared to this), but it also has severe cuts. He has no action. It's full of unnecessary rubbish. Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character when he fired him for him. So (after a bunch of crap) here are: the guy's knife on the knife and says something like "you're dead now". Then the main character says, "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police you threatened me." So (the killer) the guy is like (just to cry): "Oh no ... cops follow me! Oh ... my God!" <br /> <br /> Do not forget: this is just an example. I really can not believe that this movie really exists. So if you want to see the movie WORST sometimes ... continue, I recommend it :)
