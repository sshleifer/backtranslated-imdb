There's only one thing I'm going to say about a cat in a hat ... like a kid's movie and a good comedy movie that's upset ... I lost track of how terrible the jokes in a movie that not only did it, . Oh, and by the way, as the cat in the hat talked, it was unpleasant ... as to the plot that I forgot. Who cares, it's so bloody. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers were trying to sound the same as he did in Austin's power without talking about it, and that was too successful - but what a bad thing about it. you do not see it - it's down 100 .............................. jokes are so vague that it's funny
