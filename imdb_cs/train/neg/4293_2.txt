"The Rainmaker", released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of their time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Even they can not save this entirely through melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is terribly dirty as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, she can not even pull it off. She is too strong to be trusted because she was just plain and too old. Lancaster goes to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is too derogatory and looks more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to get a little over the cast - but they can do just that. The 1950s seem to have been a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to split her wings as an actress, and that's fine. She just made the wrong choice here. Luckily for my fans (I am among them) did not do too many of them. Through cast A-Sheet and good production value it does not work.
