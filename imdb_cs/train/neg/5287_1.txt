I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they had the finest mini-series Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to create a full-length version, but of course many had to be removed; Unfortunately, what ended up on the floor in the castle grounds was all a wonderful joke and humor, leaving a movie that was just a melodrama rather than a fun show of English rural ways and morals. <br /> <br /> Also the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had a bad Anne that ran across the streets to Captain Wentworth as a stupid modern teenager (and if you become a stupid modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: running for a man like a woman, warm is not okay). This is something that a beautiful woman of Napoleonic era would never do, and certainly not such a heroine. <br /> <br /> Some said they found this ancient laugh; my reaction was not laughter but outrage. The very idea of ​​such a corruption of Austen's work is contempt. It was terrible.
