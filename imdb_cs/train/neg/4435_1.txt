God, I have not seen this movie for a long time. Maybe not from The New Guy or Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is terribly terrible. Mira Sorvino is empty and the wooden game must definitely be inspired by Freddie. The film production was clumsy (like a game, and the feeling of jail does not work well on the film). The actors did not know what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible and her sexual appeal did not exist, so it was painful to see her "seduction" of other characters, and they "fell" for it. And what about okcaisional shots of live audiences in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would be self-caused pain to finish this movie.
