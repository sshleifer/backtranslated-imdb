Have they finished the movie makers even before they released them? The script jumps from place to place without explaining much. The beginning does not specify whether it is the predecessor or not. It starts with Superman's beginning on Earth and then jumps to the point after the last movie - but this audience does not really say that. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home-wreck, stalker, and someone who is clearly depressing and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The end is totally absurd. Superman, who finished at the hospital, just wanted to kill me. I'm seriously waiting for SNL skit, where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results are - in the case of a child, Superman, you're a father." Summary - OK deals with Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is virtually undetectable.
