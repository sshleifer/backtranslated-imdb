I am not one of those who think the king is a great writer, his books are scattered for a few hours, and often have interesting spaces, but in my opinion they are very quickly disintegrating if you give them some serious thoughts. br /> <br /> This movie suffers from being a fairly accurate re-narration of the King's story. If you've read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no changes to scenes or characters. This is a movie that has become King's fan for King's fans. <br /> <br /> For others, the movies are nothing terrible, it is the horror of a "gypsy curse", with its twist being a curse something that many people want to become thinner. The final third has some serious structural problems and the slightly forced ending seems to be a bit violation of the rules of this genre. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you could also read the book because there is nothing new ... <br /> <br />
