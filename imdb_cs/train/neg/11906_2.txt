Watching "Der Himmel über Berlin" as a teenage late 80's was a deep experience for me - "so it was what the movies could be like." Together with "Paris, Texas" and "Up to the End of the World" he still has a special place in his heart and mind - the confirmation of Wim Wenders' genius. The constant decline in quality of work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hit a terrible low point. Gone are captivating pictures or music. No search or view of a great view. There are only figures and hard-covered political statements that cut down on clichés, and frankly ridicule the intelligence of adult audiences. Is it well dried? Whatever the reason, it is time for Mr Wenders to either intensify or stop completely.
