Oh dear! I rarely bored the movie "horror" or laughed at me like this one. After a disturbed start with a fascinating premise, it goes down much more than a shorter move, with some supernatural and sexual helmets. Usually the excellent Alice Krige is in this unnecessary and the plots of conspiracy are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you are desperate. Rating: 3/10.
