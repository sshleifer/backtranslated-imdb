Oh, good. It was a really big mess that simply could not help. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mom (Diane Keaton) and is not going anywhere. As long as his mother meets a wealthy merchant named Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom he may marry. <br /> <br /> It would be a good movie if Heder did not play his Jeffrey so unpleasant, the start is not a chance he would like him and he's getting worse. In the end, we should like it, but there was no reason not to change from the selfish brute to the beginning of the movie. Keaton does not seem to even try and is in terrible form after 2007 Because I said Sa. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton and where should they believe their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though they do not even seem too interested. Apart from a few small smiles, this film does not really deserve to be called a comedy because you can hardly laugh! If you're in the mood for the recent Diane Keaton watch Mad Money or Smother, which are much better than a terrible effort.
