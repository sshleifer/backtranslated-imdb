I'm not from America, and I know what's Swap. When this show appeared, I was thrilled to see some great brilliant sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real Hall of Fool. I was poorly judged by its title, it has no adult content, no nudity, no vulgar dialogues (a large cast has cast Hallmark and I think they have edited / deleted such content to make it clean). <br /> <br /> A show that shows the current American / Western family status, supernatural peculiar nations, polluted youth and their sucking family. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in their home and to change their family routine again with their new own rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or equally bad. At the end, each mother will come back with her husband and try to conclude what they have done to each family for the past few days. It's the rainy part of the program where every contestant is fighting for his rights. I was soaked in seeing all these place instead of seeing some cool grown-up sex stuff. I mean who is doing this program, more than the one who gave the name "Wife Swap"; its better to be called "Mother Swap". Overall, it spoils all the great things the real Wife Swap means! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = The average radiation of the reality show.
