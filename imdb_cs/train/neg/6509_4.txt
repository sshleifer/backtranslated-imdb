Sean Bean is great as well as photographs, places and costumes. However, the conspiracy is a little confused, and the conclusion flat. This conspiracy has fundamentally changed from the Cornwell novel, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better to read than watched. Sharpe was too tightly dragged here, unlike his literary alter ego, who seems to be more intelligent and resolute despite his fear of his new role as an upgraded officer. I really liked the short scene in which Sharpe flooded the "real" officer, and after a quick pause and pierced view, the surprise and agile officer pushed back. This sets the tone for his later exams as commanding officer. Rating: "4" of "10"
