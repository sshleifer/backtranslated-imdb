Power Rangers, the crazy merchandising television kids show from the 1990s, must be the most useless and ridiculous TV show ever made. What exactly is the point of this show as well, other than selling the other for the kids? There is nothing at all worth redemption or interest in this show. Look for costumes that look like dirty dirt. <br /> <br /> The style of hair, earrings, and fashion in the early nineties look ridiculous today. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at any price!
