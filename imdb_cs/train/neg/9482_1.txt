Do not waste your time, you do not have to pay for this break! As it happened, it is outside of me. (I do not know why there are at least 10 rows ... I've summed up this scary movie, but, oh well ...) The game was terrible, as if everyone needed lessons. Give it weak, end ... Feh! I think cinematography was the only thing that was not full of food ... well, maybe the sound was minimalistically fine. The only good thing is, if they could make this film, even with some money to make it, there can be hope for every screenwriter with the REAL idea. So you all with your heart! I think the same goes for the actors ... if these people actually paid, then you can also!
