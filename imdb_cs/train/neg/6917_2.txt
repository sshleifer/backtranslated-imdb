Once again the same familiar story about a man (the writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most desired ambition in life: success. The funny script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" Christmanish message (our only effort in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) scene at the end when Agent Hopkins defeated the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not at all sexy or bad) for all the bad things she has done to this inappropriate character. It's not a bad actor's effort (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in the role of "Sex and the City" again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try the not so popular Greek film called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (the old man gives his soul to the devil to return to his youth)
