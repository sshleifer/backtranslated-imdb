It should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson, who played together as two journalists. Mike Nichols directed. Uh uh. It's a dull blunt blunt! Unimportant and predictable! Slow and out of focus! He is a cook carver, a boy meets a girl, a boy marries a girl, a boy has a matter, a girl leaves a boy's story. Now is the original concept! After a two-hour scream (it was only two, it was like six.) I did not know if it was comedy, romance, tragedy, or soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things 16 years ago, which we'd rather forget. I hope the damage to the reputation of Streepa et al. The healing begins and the emulsion on the master begins to disappear. It's not such a bad picture. It's just that it's so incredible.
