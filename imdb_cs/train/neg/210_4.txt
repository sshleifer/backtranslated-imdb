You might not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has a lot of original artists of early Hip Hop, but it was obvious that it could be their big break, of course for some it was and it's nice. But if you think this is an original Hip Hop culture, you're wrong. It is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look at the first two films I mentioned. They mediate the roughness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating of this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even outraged. This is probably because, although the story, acting, dialogue and direction are all terrible, music and dance are what people love about it. I love dancing, but at that time I thought electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so glad that around 1986 a new generation of classical Hip Hop artists appeared as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie) and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie and therefore does not work for me. I think Wild Style does not have much story but the music is great and authentic. Of course, tastes are different and it's okay. But when it comes to me, this movie is a basket, with the exception of break dance and some music, so I can not rate more than 4 out of ten.
