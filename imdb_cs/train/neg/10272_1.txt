When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had to throw my mom in a pile of movies in the "4 for $ 20" section of Blockbuster. When we returned home and appeared in the movie ... twenty minutes into it, we found out we turned to each other, "it's upset, I admit, a few lines from our friends in the cafe smiled a little, but come on, at least a couple of good actors! Every moment in the movie, if the acting is bad and the film does not go slow and painfully slow and really looks interesting, I can make it and some laughs about how they are behind (or below) But I can only take that much. Crying scenes seemed as if the actors had hysterical bouts of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines ... Amateurs did not even close to acting in this film Everyone here came to say that this movie was good had to be on some really good drugs while they watched the film It's the most dangerous thing I've ever had dissatisfaction DO NOT USE OR BUY THIS FILM !!!!!
