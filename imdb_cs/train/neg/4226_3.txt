Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I heard the rumors, I read reviews - but I had to realize what was happening. Well, let me say it - IT BLOWS !!! The worst performer of any movie ever made, the dubbing that had to be done while all the participants were totally futile, stupid and ridiculous gore FX, no recognizable plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandmother shot it with camera, no joke - made of tinplate - the list goes on and on ... Three boys get stuck on an island where a bunch of wizards with plastic and target swords run around. Two of the prisoners are liberated along with the insurgency monster on the island and get a day off before the rest of the "trunk" is hunted ... that's quite enough ... <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> movies I've ever had to do. The budget had to be about $ 200 and was spent exclusively on gore FX (which was not really a bad idea ...). ZOMBIE DOOM is NOT ONLY different than the stringed common ridiculous gore scene with a lot of HORRIBLY dialogue dubbing. This film makes further trips without a budget such as PREMUTOS: THE LIFE OF THE LIFE looks like TITANIC. Some people can throw a ZD in the "so bad-is-good" category - and I think if you're really drunk or tall and watching him with a few friends in the MST3K style - I think he could look at it. But not me. At most I hated everything. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally frightening and is included as a "bonus" for the release of Shock-O-Rama ZD) suggests other works by Andreas Schnaas - then he should be forbidden to have something to do with filming sometimes again under the death penalty . In the second half of the movie there is one fun kung fu battle and plenty of blood - so I'll make it very generous 3/10 - do a favor and skip it.
