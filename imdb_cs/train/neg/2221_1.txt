I'm sorry, but it could have been terrifying in 1978 when it came out, but it just does not hold it in modern times. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing a Halloween mask. The most interesting moment in the whole movie is when his parents pull a mask to see that their son has killed their daughter. The film is coming out of the slope and is not lifted until the last fifteen minutes, but it's too late, we have lost the interest in the story. There is hardly any character development and people have always been angry that Laurie is such a great heroine when she really is not too much. I'm sorry that I do not agree with everyone who frightens this movie, but if you want a great horror film, go see The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars because this film can never earn such a high rating.
