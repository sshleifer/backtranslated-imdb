Anyone who gives the film a good overview may have had something to do with their creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The act is stiff, the generic soundtrack is ridiculous, the direction is dim and the strangest of all, the teacher is really not so attractive (which makes students' pitiful progress more uncomfortable). The creative minds behind these garbage should be dismantled and decomposed to prevent further manifestations of such concentration. I'm sure some of the hungry children from Africa would use the money they made in this project. Hell, the funds would also see a more enlightened plan that would encourage an addict; at least one of them would have some fun. For the sole reason that I did not make a final illness, I will give this film two.
