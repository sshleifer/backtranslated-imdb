Vincente Minelli is usually worth it; Meet me in St. Louis, Bad and the Beautiful. I was waiting for this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some run in the run is a scene after go-nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack, he has returned from war to find disappointment in family relationships, disappointing that he is angry with him, lives in unsatisfactory hills when he persuades him to finish his unsatisfactory writing project. The film has a major dramatic role in which a disappointed villain captures Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointed is happening. The sequence is to be stretched, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so scattered with nice colors, he does not notice that the scene is a bloody clich√© and the characters are so clearly drawn and ill-developed that we do not really care that they are shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the conspicuous figures standing around the grids and living rooms, which after two hours get nervous. Hell is probably other people. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this movie. The dilemma of soldiers who return to displacement and indifference after World War II is better able to manage in the "Best of Our Life". And one of Inge's two products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic," refers to the desperation of being trapped in a dead town, with much more.
