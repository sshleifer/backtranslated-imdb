It's one of the funny things about being young that a person can easily be confused with advertising. I have already talked about another movie in which advertising for (comedy) film makes it look funnier than it is. Seeing advertising in 1981, I was thinking that it would be a strangely entertaining movie. What I did not know with me and my brother who saw me was that the scene used in television advertising was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that appeared in the movie earlier, I can only guess that it's nothing funny to use! The last scene is through a young potion of youth. Fu Manchu turns from a long bearded old man into a bright young Asian / Elvis rock star! (Together with the singers no less!) <br /> <br /> This is not the real reason why in the 1930s Peter Sellers does the best with the material at hand but for his "comedy" moments. The rest of the actors were just boring, and my brother and I were sitting all over this laugh about anything. It was quite natural that we expected a Pink Panther comedy, Peter Sellers was so great in it. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that it was his last film before he died. His appearances at Muppet's show were more fun than this poorly designed flop. Still, I do not blame him. I abused everyone else for not trying to make a better movie about it. 2 stars are generous!
