It was one of the deadliest films we have watched in recent months with a predictable line and a bad actor (especially supporting characters). The interview with Hughes Laurie on the DVD was in fact much more enriching than the movie itself ... Hugh Laurie apparently made a lot of effort to learn how to dance Samba, but the extent of his character is only required to dive into the baby's end of the pool. The film is based on the look of a beautiful girl and great music, but these are not enough for fun. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or inside a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
