This is a film that relies only on a rather controversial picture of incest and lesbianism to notice. This is it. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of "sexual scenes" is absolutely absent. Act and dialogue are more suitable for high school children, but the subject is for adult audiences. It's a seamless and shallow film. It could have been much better if he had a story and another drama. Ah, and one more thing: why are so internal monologies so overused? It seems to be so cheap. In all the filthy film for Romanian cinema and for the mature audience they were trying to look for. I know the means are rare, but that's not always the excuse for the movie, as it does. please start using some good actors in your movies and stop them from recycling by musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
