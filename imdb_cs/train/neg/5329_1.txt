As a true fan of Elvis, this film is a complete embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The film opens with a beautiful son, Stay Away, and the Grand Canyon scenery gives the audience the hope of something special. Elvis gets into the picture and his talent is losing a lot of time, especially on other songs. This movie I was sitting twice to make sure it was a piece of junk mail !!! 1 of 10 !!!
