I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in every society: sex addiction. In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and the hero that we have nonstop sex with all women (crazy, quirky, neurotic) threatens his marriage, work, and even his life. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are terrible; especially acting. Oh, you will not enjoy any sexual scene, most of them are done very badly, and maybe you think you're watching a home movie. <br /> <br /> Second, make sense. How could such an intelligent and beautiful woman build all the unpleasant things from her husband? How could she believe it ?! The third situation is invaluable and will cause you to laugh for a moment. <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with black cinema is simply useless and lets you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those that will find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid; it's not a soft core, it's not documentary, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a demanding effort to create a so-called Documentary Director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Kinski's feet on the screen are worth seeing. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not return.
