This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is usually good. I first read the cover and expected a good movie. Even though it was a horror movie. I do not want to. But there was no fear in mind when watching the movie. It was a boring, very funny movie. The look of Denise Richards was again for joy. But that's all. We (we four) are a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this movie and <br /> <br /> it yourself.
