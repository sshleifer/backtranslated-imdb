This is the cruelest film I've ever seen, but in all justice it's observable and rather humorous. I do not think filmmakers want this to be your typical Hollywood blasting quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer that melts into the burden of toxic waste and causes a reaction with it and the snow (as it is in the middle of the winter). Then he turns into a murderer of a snowman who just laughs at him. This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The murders are merry. I do not recommend you to go and buy it (just as I did - the cover looked good!) But if it happened to happen on TV one night and you laugh, hold it.
