Before I start ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay now, when it's out of the way, I just want to say what the fools called "hosts" do in the world do they think they are doing? I have recently made sure that the host does not discriminate, hate full wounds on television, or try to push his own faith into every unfortunate soul that goes into the channel. Of these crazy, idiotic, conservative, biblical fools, Fred Phelps loves Pat Robertson daily. I am all free to speak, but when does it concern a person who, to a great extent, says that if you dare from his ideal way of life, are you sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many problems. One day in my class we had a substitute teacher, so we chose to watch a TV channel because learning did not give us any work. And we (against many of us) looked at Club 700 and, of course, that the crazy Pat got angry and talked about the Bible, and he said to Simon, "God says homosexuality is a sin," and I actually heard a baby " that he is right. " WTF ??? Seriously, if a host attempts to get people to think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin, then he has to seriously accept that host, link them and drop them out of a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
