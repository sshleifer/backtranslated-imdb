Edison's story was decent, but one actor especially destroyed the movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed the film every part he released during the film. He is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen, and I should face the same fate as the whole of F.R.A.T. group. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this movie. You do not even have to download, downloading porn is a much better choice. And Justin, if you read it, hold on to the music. Though it's not good, you've done a great job to make people think you can really sing.
