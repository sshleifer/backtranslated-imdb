Hopefully this is the last nightmare. This is an example of a good thing that has worsened. Well, there is still some pleasure to be, but only in the most rational sense. Rachel Talalay has been there for the duration of this franchise, she has been on the production staff and even produced. I do not know what she was thinking about, but this debacle comes with a human video game guy and a guest performance of Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I knew what she thought when she wrote / drove this unsatisfactory piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this film was nothing more than an exaggerated popcorn movie instead of a similarity to horror, with the conventional use of the 3D ending. Are not the glasses smart? And you can keep it! It's the equivalent of having just spent $ 9.00 to be rich. Here's 10 cents. Do not you feel special now? I'm sorry, but for me it just does not make me feel strange. <br /> <br /> And Freddy has another facelift. This was the worst for me, I think. All the beautiful art that went into his "appearance" in earlier films was replaced by a seemingly cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. It looks ... more like a burning victim to be, and more like a skin disease. Changing the lead composition as far as the series is about the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They did it and they did it. So I do not think it matters. But it depended on me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. It's just ... another monster with low rent, like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises. from which you can only hope that the writers think they are humorous, one-off and clever compensation (sadly, they did not happen on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So I need nothing more than popcorn to catch and prepare for laughter because there was no scary or exciting moment throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
