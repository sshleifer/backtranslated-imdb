That's a terrible movie. All three stories are covered by a psychiatric hypnotized part, which is useless and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some ladies, there are some things that make no sense, but hypnotism is a matter for it. The other, with the poor Bill Paxton as a roommate, should not be seen. The last, sadly the best is almost incomprehensible, which I think is better than other garbage.
