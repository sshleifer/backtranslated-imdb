It must be the easiest, the dumbest, the slowest monster of all time. It's a complete joke that even got into the theaters. This is like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be worthy of the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. People who are involved in this sad waste heap must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them power. I'm sure they were lobotomized before filming. How else can one explain the utter and utter stupidity that this crucible contains. Do not waste a minute of your life. Do not even waste your time by posting reviews.
