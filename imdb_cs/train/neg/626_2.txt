The spirit of a murdered undergraduate is a scary animator who then takes revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really upset me. It has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, the atmosphere, but it manages to short the good things bad. In the middle of the road, I quickly moved forward and then went through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. At first, there are about thirty and yet they are supposed to be in high school. You do not believe anything from how it happens. The scarecrow, when he looks great, is not much for that. He speaks stupidly that it is a linery and moves in a way that was designed to be fun, then scary. Is it a comedy or a horror film? It is a problem that goes beyond one layer on most of the dialog and is set. It looks like we send every cliche rather than a horror film of horror. Some people expect that the film was created for a very narrow audience in mind, fans of horror who want to change the genre rather than embrace it. Despite a good-looking monster, it's a film to avoid. Even if you select them in a trash for less than five dollars, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
