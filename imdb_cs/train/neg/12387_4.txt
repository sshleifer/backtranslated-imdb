Lipstick is another glossy film failure. I'm trying to think about one good thing I could say about the movie, and I'm having trouble coming up with something. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway wore at the end of the movie was the best part. Writing and scripting were not the worst I've ever met, but it could have been much better. The lipstick was very nice for the eye to look. The sets were very shiny and nice to look at. Cast was fine. I had the feeling that Anne Bancroft's character was the only possible figure in the whole movie. It was sad that Chris Sarandon would spend time at this time.
