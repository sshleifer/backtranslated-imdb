Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic groom, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand that sex with a dog (which is also an abuse of animals) can be considered fun or entertaining. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to shoot these films. I know some people criticize this comment, but I strongly feel that these types of films are driving the fire of hatred and other misogynistic feelings towards women. This company continues to display women as sexual objects unlike humans. We call it "civilized", but I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of civilization.
