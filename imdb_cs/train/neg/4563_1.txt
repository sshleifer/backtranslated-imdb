This movie is perhaps the cheapest, easiest and poorest sequel ever to happen. <br /> <br /> But it is Disney's funniest and most idiotic film and it guarantees laughter for sappy stories and lame fences from the beginning of finishing. <br /> <br /> This is a group of short stories that seem to be a bad fanfare. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * First is all about Beast and Belle, which are tiny over the pathetic argument. Then the three lost new characters decide to divide things into creating a letter of forgiveness that Belle would give them. Partly in this small episode, Belle has eyes on the walls that my siblings do and I laugh. Then she and the beast fight more than the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Seriously old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then another is that Lumiere is the world's largest romance. This came from a person who could awaken something female. And they make FiFi a psychotic hobby trying to kill Belle, and by the end it's flying out. What message to send children! <br /> <br /> Then another is that Mrs. Potts is nervous. And then it's all about Beast, who becomes an overpowering bird, until he seems utterly stupid. The animation is so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 errors that you can clearly see ... and the coloring is terrible. Belle is a sympathetic juice that blurs every time something goes wrong. In addition, it is tiny and very different from ordinary Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting almost all the time.) I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated.) But the worst figure is Mrs. Potts. It is destroyed. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give her 1/10 behind the clearing, but I give her 10/10 for comedy.
