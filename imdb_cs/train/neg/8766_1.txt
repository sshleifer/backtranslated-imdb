I should point out that the film should not be watched. He can not accommodate his tribute in such a magnificent way that it's almost an insult to those brave men's memories. The extraordinary effect was terrible, I did not expect the Director's overall lack of appreciation to be of military technology. How can a machine gun, which normally ignites at a speed of 600 rounds per minute at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes before them? How can humans survive when artillery shells are falling so close to 20 feet? How come the artillery shells fell on both sides of the road and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did this disbelief about the gun scare me, it was the cliché of the situation and the mismatch of the dialogues that murder shouted to me. There were standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan with jyaada musalmaan on Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat mat ye hera hukum hai. The stupidity that is the smallest. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote was true. The director worked without a script and shows it. There is no current for the movie. There is no progress from one battle to another. It's just one fighter fight the next, no link to the overall plan of the war. Explanatory scenes are terrible. The boss of the army looks unconvincing. To make things worse, the theater people no doubt cut footage to fit into the four-hour movie within 3 hours.
