There is little to attract "Dan in Real Life". First, the setting is incredible. Did you really believe that during this very long first meeting at Marie's restaurant did not tell Dana where she was going? And because Dan spoke during this conversation, why would he attract him so much? I did not notice why Mary was so attracted to Dan. He is very narcissistic, and he does little to convince us that he is really a good guy (for example, he lies in a bookstore, mocks his brother about his past friends and tries to jealous Mary with a "blind date"). There are more creations such as the ridiculous scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie are going to tell the whole family. Yeah, as if it really could happen. Dan in real life is slow, humble, and manipulative. Even feline films such as the Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable "tearjerker".
