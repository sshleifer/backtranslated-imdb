I look forward to the film, Kathryn Bigelow, with great expectations for endless hype and the 6 Oscarats he won. Unfortunately this is really not a good movie. The statement seemed to be accurate and believable on all pages, but the story just found it incomplete, and the direction of the film looked uncertain and random. The actors did a good job, but for me I really did not know what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and breathtaking as a full metal jacket, not as epic as a group of brothers, not as an action packed like ... well, anything. I certainly do not know why it was designed so much, or why people are "encouraging" this epic dimension. Remember, given the fact that in recent years it's the film's caliber, I suppose it's not too much.
