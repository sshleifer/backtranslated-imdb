Daniella has some breweries that are under her attractive exterior. She begins to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (which she remembers) who was burned for being a werewolf. She goes a little wild when they are beaded by men and breaking their necks. She eventually finds a person who helps to contain her inner beast, but when others destroy their bliss she pulls her violent and hairy vengeance. <br /> <br /> "The Werewolf" is not much of a goof film, but it is a good crowd. The fun time could be earned by bad acting / dabing / translation and the simple glory of production. But is it his own, he moves slowly but has enough nudity to wake you up?
