This is an interesting adaptation of the topic, which is quite controversial, (just read more comments on this movie). It seems you either love it or you hate it, and it seems that most people make this distinction based on whether they believe the tribulations and the end times will appear in the movie. Basically, the movie - and its sequel - was made for about $ 1.30. The production values ​​are "Plan 9 From Outer Space," and acting is at the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (sorry Ed Wood). By postponing the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add even the slightest idea that the story might actually come up close to something that could happen in the future, and it will be even more scary. This film and its sequel did not try to bring reasons for the tribulation to happen when it did. "Left Behind" and "Omega Code" were trying to get into the "thief" and explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to him. The net effect was "Thief" did much better work on the scary parts of the film instead of spreading too thin trying to explain what is happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequel what they are - stories of horror. The fact that horror stories can be indirectly made by God is far more terrifying. If you are thinking about the subject, it has done its work - even if you never believe it.
