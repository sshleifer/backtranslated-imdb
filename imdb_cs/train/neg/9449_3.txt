Dr. Seuss would now be crazy if he was alive. The cat in the hat demonstrates how the film productions can have a classic story and turn it into a soulless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as an infamous cat in a hat, a big mistake! Myers proves that he can not act in this movie. She acts like a pretty girl with thousands of tricks on her sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in the ranks of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with some improvements, and like most of the films based on other stories, never shoot the original story! To bring to the wrong neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who would never get to life. This movie is like a reluctant newspaper comic if you think about it. The movie definitely looks sticky! Sure there are funny jokes for adults, like the tail cutter and the censor disappear before it says a naughty word, slightly humorous. At least Grinch dared and the movie was really good! This film is a cartoon piece of soy with bright colors and poor media acting. Was Mike Myers even in this movie really? And another thing, fish. What's wrong with the silly fish! When you first see it, it's a real fish. When you see him next time, everything is animated and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber toy dough! This movie is completely out of the target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised she even had good jokes like the wind on the water park, that was good. So please, if you have a choice, watch Grinch instead of this mess.
