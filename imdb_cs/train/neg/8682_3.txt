I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, although I do not agree with the many things Bush has done. And I love the daily show and the Colbert report. There have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I like jokes about Conan, Letterman, Len, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy ever to go on the earth (I do not think it's stupid). But it will come until the time is enough and it's not really funny. I see where it can be funny and it's (we're kidding from our authority that it's funny). The comedy is central, though it is hard to try and talk to him. I think maybe a special episode, but the whole series is just stupid. It seems that CC just says the same bush jokes we have heard WAY many times. I really can not see this show last season.
