while one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me a wise insight, I know what is first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original "incoming" cut, and I was very happy. it was funny, sexy, noisy, all the main requirements of the drive-in movie. you have to remember that it was shot and released before all others ... animal animals, porkyho, etc. ... in its own way this swing was really a long time ago. for whatever reason, the film was dedicated to major distributors who adjusted half of the original film and then edited (I mean "shuffled?") the most common scenes at all. fat guy, people with goat head ... what was all heck ?! I'm sure it was added for another T & A, but it was so slow that it caused something to happen before it crashed into a shouting and painful stop. but overall it's an amusing memory for me ... especially in that I can say the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in it!
