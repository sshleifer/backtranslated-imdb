I think I often look at bad movies and original sci-fi movies are one of the best sources for these movies you find. As such, you can certainly imagine your disappointment when I saw the Sands of forgetting. The hearing was unusually subgroup, unlike the shamefully disgraceful science fiction scenario we usually hold. There are several actors you would most likely recognize, although you might not know their names. Special effects of CGI are minimal and as such lack one of the greatest sources of comedy in science fiction. Sure, there are some funny moments like when a bulldozer gets into the hand or when the main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl he knows for a few days, but in the end he just does not have to turn on the floor with laughter and I consider this to be the main disappointment. If I rated it on a ten-hour scale that would be specifically designed to assess TV films, I would probably give it 4, perhaps even 5. It's a real shame to wait until the next sci-fi original movie to make a good laugh and I really hope, that this film is not part of any overall increase in the quality of sci-fi original films.
