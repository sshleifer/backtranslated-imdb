I'll say it again: this movie was totally flawed. Children will like it, of course, but adults ... doubters. The whole thing was basically a rediscovery of the original, which is to be expected, because in the first film they have quite explored the whole concept, but have yet to completely re-evaluate the film? I think everything is happening from Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgan "Ursula is a crazy sister" that looks out of nothing and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous because Triton is there with his magic trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because it requires action to do nothing. I could go on but I will not. The whole thing is a blatant attempt to make more money from Little Mermaid, and of course she was thrown away without any thought, knowing she was going to sell it. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
