I do not really have comments, but I wanted to warn people about this movie. It's an unfinished student film without any redemption. At the technical level, it is totally amateur - constantly unintentional jump adjustments in scenes, dubbing wildly outside, etc. The story is completely clichÃ©, the structure is ridiculous and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too cruel: I've made a part of student films and they've all been horrible, but there's no reason for this movie to be in a world where innocent fans would have to see it. /> <br /> A safe assumption - like cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
