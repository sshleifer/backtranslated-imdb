I just liked watching it and having fun with it, it's just a bad movie. I saw this movie through the useful sarcasm Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have a DVD. If you turn to the other side of the DVD, it shows the real movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people are grilled cheeses. Acting actors, special effects, and plotting are generally very tricky and unrealistic. "He does not need his lungs," said Vratka when he noticed how his head could still speak while he had no body, and Tom Servo just sadly remarked, "No, my cup of juice!" The end is just classical and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved a "cat fight" between two strippers. The "Meow" after the fight or scene, anything, was classical. So in some ways it was a fun movie. I think that for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. Well, look at the MSTK3 version, you get a great laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Brain that dies: 1/10
