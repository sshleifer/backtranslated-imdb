it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not sure if it was serious or just satire. One of those films used by all the stupid ones who dander the cliches they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good at it. But otherwise it breathed. It was more than a decade ago when I saw it, but it still hurts and stops in my mind. <br /> <br /> The last line in the movie actually sums up how silly it is. I will not destroy it for you to try to fate by viewing this movie. But at the end I guarantee you a nghya * moment, with a few of them. If you do not have anything better and want to laugh and laugh, maybe it might be worth it. Besides, if you're forced to go out on a date with someone you do not really like, recommend watching this movie together and probably leaving you when they see it. That's a decent price to pay.
