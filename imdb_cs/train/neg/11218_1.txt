This film is not worth the film that was photographed. Dialogue is a flat, clich√© filled with overused lines and comes with amateur actors who first heard their reading as a screenplay. Torn, shaken, movie style is a cheap imitation of visual effects in the style of "The Ring". The characters do not even behave like a normal person. For example, a character looking for her twin sister at her home walks through her front door, creeps across the house, scared and sobbing, and never calls up her sister's name to find out if she is at home. What? She should think she was just burying her sister instead of looking for her. Too many memories of her childhood. Too many unwanted shots are a typical sign of an amateur director. It's really fun watching many women's shots driving your car down the street, down the driveway, around this corner, here, there, side by side, now a front view. Enough. Do you think you are watching a TV commercial for Solaris! A horrible movie. 0 out of 100. I'm really sorry for anyone who spent money doing this movie or looking at it.
