This is a movie about the cruelty of animals. Under the mask of the marathon race, we see the images of extreme animal abuse, including literally running the horse to death in SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this has his conscience cleansed spiritually by the flames of the burial / burning of the horse, who is of course still dead and was tortured to death. It's one of the deadliest, weakest movies I've ever had the reluctance to watch. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the target line on DYING animals, we should admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to introduce the producer and director to the marathon race; I'll decide when it's over, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
