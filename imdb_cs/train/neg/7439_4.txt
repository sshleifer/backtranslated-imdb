Another view of horror. Stylish differences between American and Russian films are interesting. From my American perspective, however, this film was not that good. The protagonist Marie, played by Anastasia Hille, was not a nice figure, and I could hardly identify her. Most often it was unpleasant and confused for the rest of the time. Also, too much time was devoted to bringing it to the main place of the film. Then it took a long time for a real effort to appear. Once this happened, the volume seemed to have been used as the main effect, which was much more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most of the movies with direct access to the film and did not use sex to cope with a thin conspiracy. Overall, I would recommend him for rent, but not for the audience.
