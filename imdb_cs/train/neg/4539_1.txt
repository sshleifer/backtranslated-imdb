I've never seen anything as bad as this movie for some time. The film was boring, a long long and terrible plot. The special effect is angry as hell - it's like watching the movie in 1999. It's a complete loss of an hour and a half my time. The performance of Matthew Settle was pretty bad. I saw him in a group of brothers when Lt.Speirs was playing, it was not bad. In fact, it was not bad at all. But in this film his acting performance was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Moreover, his eyes look empty, as if he did not feel it. I was surprised because he was good at a band of brothers. Anyway, do not even bother watching this movie. It's a big big BIG waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, do more than watch this movie. Believe me, you're sorry!
