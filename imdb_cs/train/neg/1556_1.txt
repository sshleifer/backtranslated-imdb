In this movie I was China. I chose the screen name of Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling in Italy at that time and could not say his real name correctly, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani because it was like Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I've never done it before, but it was so fun to shoot. Every morning they gave me "playing a lesson" (which of course was not useful). They talked about my voice (thank God). David and Peter were on a shot full of good humor and jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write-off according to confidential information. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 because I have a sense of humor but 10 for the fun I've had in "acting".
