I often do not provide any star reviews, but my computer will not allow me to make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Introductory titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low-budget exploitative film, it is attributed to 17 producers. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, an inappropriate husband, Kenneth, returns home to his family in an upscale community. The house is pig. His wife Della (Kim Basinger) let the kids run all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We're already in deep water. Mrs Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Are they her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della goes to the shopping center, a long scene that could be shortened. To dash home, the idea of ​​eeeeeeevil of male aggression extends into the universe that he runs around football players in full uniform and plays on Christmas Eve. Sure. Under the bonus, a vehicle with a deer slap is connected. <br /> <br /> However, we get some real tension in driving scenes. It's raining and traffic is bad. We first see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then Della tries to drive and talk on her mobile phone at the same time, turning around at one point to check the back rear seat of the phone charger. old college boyfriend, trying to buy things but her credit card is denied - yeah, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going to break but it's too complicated for the script to follow. much runs the deepest gang in film history. One white boy (Lukas Hass follows his career going down to the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine the company of Up with People, which is bad and you have a clue. <br /> <br /> Although they have a gun, it gives them a stance. Police cop comes to investigate his hand and shoot him in the head, firing more than once. Parking is full of people everywhere and no one will notice it. Della escapes in her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit safe place, she goes to the building where she kills all four bad boys one by one with simple tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> MAJOR spoiler forwards. <br /> <br /> She's going home. The car runs out to run through the rain. She checks for the children, she goes down, and when her husband asks hopelessly what has got him into the shopping mall, he shows his gun and shoots him at the empty distance. The experience with four punks should result in Della's personal empowerment. Instead we know that her children are likely to spend Christmas in foster care or in a group of homes because the state is gathering them while she responds to the murder of one charge. Four punks can be classified as a justifiable murder in self-defense. Husband, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it on the cable. If I saw it in the theater (would I get a release?) I would be furious. As it is, I'm just sad to see talents, like Mrs Basinger and Mr. Haas, throw themselves away with such garbage. One very good thing. It was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford has not received any further written or overdraft credit since she has gone through this turd. There is justice in the world.
