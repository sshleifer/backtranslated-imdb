One friend once asked me to read his screenplay, which was selected by the film studio. I think it was one of the most awkward and insipid scripts I've ever read, a daring underestimation. Still, I never told him. Why? Because in a world where movies like "While It Was Out" can be lit up green and attract an Oscar star such as Kim Basinger, a scenario lacking in character, content and common sense, it is not a guarantee that it will not be sold. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Every threat is legitimate, from weak dialogue and bad behavior to downward logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the assumption is not without a promise. Here are a few things that hit me: 1) I do not care how much we should think her husband is a blockbuster, the house is a clutter of toys. Since when did children abuse children to pick up after them? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Make sure the movie is stupid. But there are countless "thrillers" that I've been sitting in, where women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing when I see a woman getting the best of her martyrs. <br /> <br /> 4) I am angry! <br /> <br /> 5) Although the older reviewer has devised this phrase, I really think this movie should be called the "Red Toolbox of Doom".
