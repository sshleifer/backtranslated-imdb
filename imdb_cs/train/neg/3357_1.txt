As viewers respond to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as an original film from 1963 (true), I think it will be based on the following: Those who were great fans either a book or the original film will not think much of this ... and those who have never been exposed to neither, and who are big fans of Hollywood current trend towards "special effects" are the first and last word in how "good" film is, it will be like. <br /> <br /> Things I did not like in this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a real adaptation of the book. From the articles I read, this film should deal with other aspects of the book that the first one never received. And it seemed reasonable, no movie can cover the word word for word if it is not the length of STAND! (Not even then). But in this film there were things that were never mentioned in the movie or even discovered. She reminded me of the way they decided to kill the black man in the original movie version of SHINING. I did not like it either. What should she say in the press releases of the film is ... "We have a basic, very basic idea of ​​the book Shirley Jacksons, we kept the same names of the house and some (though not all) leading names names, but then we decided to write your own the story, and the hell we watched CHANGELING and SHINING and GHOST first and decided they were a bit suited. <br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the subject of a parapsychologist who called for a carefully selected guest who had everything in the past paranormal brushes to explore a house that really looked like "born wrong". No, instead, this "Doctor" got everyone into the house under a false pretentious test of their "insomnia" (really invited them to scare them to death, and then see how they responded to their fear ... as a laboratory rat, who mentioned , never said they were part of the experiment ... a nice guy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, was, by the way, equally different from a professional professional from the original film as a night of the day. <br /> <br /> 3. In stark contrast with the statement that was used to promote two films, "Some houses are just born bad," this house was not born bad, but rather became ill because of what there happened ... and this time Nel gets embarrassed by secrets (shades of CHANGELING). The only problem was that the so-called Mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remains a mystery for most of the audience ... but in the first place (not in the book) there was no secret because the house was bad GETTING STARTED. It is the first "victim" to die before she looked at her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way the character of Luke was built was totally absurd. It was to be a little girl who had one day to inherit a house (and he was a true skeptic of his "history") ... and in this he was just a winery, a vile little man who could not sleep (insomnia remembered) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also annoyed by the fact that the film jumped from almost trying to recreate the original scenes with a word (the scene with Nel's sister's family and Mrs. Dudley's little introductory speech ...) to take on fantastic years ago, I have been thinking of more of these other films than THE HAUNTING. It's as if he can not decide what he wants to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nel's narration throughout the movie. Origin was such a Gothic novel that the story was mostly narrated in the first person through Nel's eyes and we always gave her thoughts. This completely unique touch was completely lost in the new version. She was also trying to make Nel a lot more heroines. Original Nel was not a bad person, but it was a bitter person (it could be otherwise, when sacrificed 11 years of his life, selfishness and thieving old sister?) And I ran, and she lost her temper. This was almost too good to be true. This was never more obvious than at the top of the movie, where the writer apparently looked at GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. Changed the history of the house and too many employees. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh, whose legend appeared in the original version), was no "companion" and there was no kindergarten. There was also no "grace" (the wife of the original doctor) and the wife of Hugo Crain died altogether. These changes changed the WAY story too much. Do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy that Shirley Jackson no longer walk this earth, or whether they should ... BE SORRY (if you get my drift!) Ghosts, who could imagine, is not something !!!) <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you with some words of the original Luka (suitable substitute the word "home" as a "film"): "This" movie "would burn to the ground the soil sprinkled with salt! "My favorite film of all time remains. No competition from this.
