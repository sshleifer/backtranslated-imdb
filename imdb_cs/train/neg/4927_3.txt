Lois Weber, a self-proclaimed missionary through cinematography, wrote, directed and produced other films about controversial topics, but it may be the first to gain wide attention with TCM. This film is her accusation of abortion, but she is smartly confused by bringing eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talents in writing and other film skills are well represented here, but they can be forgiven for wanting to use them less didactically. If you're wondering what Tyrone Power, Jr. looks like "famous father," here is your chance. 1916 modes and cars are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's nice, even if you do not know propaganda.
