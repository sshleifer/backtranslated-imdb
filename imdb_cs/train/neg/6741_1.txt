Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and I get to Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It does not make sense !!!! And I'm not talking about the willing suspension of distrust that makes no sense. Why does her family live in England? Or at least why does not the British accent? She is certainly cozy with her dad and surprisingly forgives her for not being around in the last two years. (In this case, nobody ever gets much agreement about being away for so long). And what about the bachelorette parties? Nor can I get into the fact that the escort she paid is in love - it could be overcome by better filmmaking. I'm just saying that the characters, settings and plot are not exhaustive enough to create a somewhat cohesive story. And the worst part, in my opinion, is that the filmmaker consistently uses the most unflattering angles on the nose of Deborah Messing - if it was me, I would have been a filmmaker! I mean, honestly, I'm all because women are what they are, but why in the seven faithful years Will and Grace saw I never noticed how incredibly strange is my nose? Oh! Because the producers are kind to her! This movie, as well as my least popular film, Armageddon, is the guilt of the creators, not the actors. I see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. Simply, my voice is one of the worst movies I've ever spent. I'm just glad that my friend lent my DVD, so everything I lost is time. If there was a way to do this Zero star review, I would do it.
