This film raises a number of urgent questions in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to retain her film acting career over the years, on the basis of this ridiculous whispering voice and the very limited scope of expressive facial expressions she employs? Secondly ... what on earth were people responsible for doing this offensive and profoundly repulsive movies? And thirdly, since people have been so rebuked to decide to do that, somebody in the system - studios, distributors or somewhere - should not be healthy enough to prevent real completion and release. You really would have to look for a very, very long way to discover another film as profoundly disgusting as this ... and it's not even considered a horror movie - which, since it can be considered part of any legitimate film genre, is certainly it. The film worsens from the beginning to the end with the strongest madness, violence and abuse, and basically has no redemption. I'm not actually advocating censorship (in which I do not believe) ... but I really do not see how anyone could draw a conspicuous benefit from watching such a movie.
