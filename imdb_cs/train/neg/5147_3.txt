"The Blue Desert" could have the potential to be even a half-liked and more fun thriller with the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not that stupid. When he is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York City, comic artist Roberts moves into a small town in the west. In his early days, he meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, plays it well) that will not end up. Her fear of what had been in this situation twice before is hitting the friendship and relationship with the suspiciously friendly city policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character is not convincing enough, leaves distrust among audiences who would otherwise be convinced of red roses that the writers want). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because, as he tells her, Atkins is ex-con and guilty of a sexual assault. But the policemen lacked the evidence they would give him some time ago. The film had enough reptiles to make an interesting film at least, because early enough, there is such confusion as to who Roberts should believe. However, a lot of intense tension seems to be too forced, because Roberts' character never responds to simple things, as we think a reasonable person could do. And its delayed reactions allow most of this tension to appear more easily and unconvincingly, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; also the child who faced such a way that such a recollection of Kevin Anderson's personality is evident in his character in "Sleep with the Enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts were written as a stronger figure, that would be enough. Meanwhile, the movie is not so great, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
