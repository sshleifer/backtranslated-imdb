This review may include some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of a 1974 classic movie that chases the car in 60 seconds starts well. In fact, it is well done and the conspiracy moves quite well. But even the big budget in Hollywood does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original fence had thieves who work as insurance inspectors. Who could suspect them. But even when almost all aspects of H.B. Halicki's original, remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene, part 74 version that did it great. The one in this version is watered, just 10 minutes, and culminates in a monstrous special effect that takes all credibility from the pursuit. Where the original chase was very credible, she was a star stuntman who did all her own, a remake falls in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic automobile chase movie, tune the original in a commodity basket at the local rental hub and stay safe from the new remake.
