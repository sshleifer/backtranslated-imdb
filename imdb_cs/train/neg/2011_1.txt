This movie is pure guano. Mom always said if you can not say anything nice ... but Mom also says I have to do my part to warn others about this movie. I can guarantee that this is a movie that Geoffrey Rush's wish would just go away. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent ... from the cannon that gave him the script. After that, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to play "There's still something about Mary." I've always been a fan of Wes Studi, thanks to all that you keep in the holy place that she's wearing a mask on the film, so maybe people will not identify with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline arrives and even they fall. If you want to see the effective spoof of the comic book world, look for "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! NEVER USE FROM THE "MYSTERS OF THE WOMAN"!
