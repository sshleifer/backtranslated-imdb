Fashion-shattered and yet enraged half of the character of the study, exploring the different personalities of the two roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a sinking woman, a wandering smirk. We will never know why these young friends are friends. They can share confusion about the world and their places in it, but they seem to have nothing in common. Director's debut, Jack Nicholson, who also wrote a script with Jeremy Larner on the basis of Larner's book, does not tell us these characters clearly and does not even shape the scene to help us identify with everyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (especially from the novice William Tepper in the central role), but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps deliberately), skeptical or uncertain. Bruce Dern plays basketball coach with heavy ride, Karen Black is an older, married lady Tepper has a relationship and Michael Margotta is Tepper's sad friend (in off-putting, over-top-performance). Nicholson can not set sequences with any taste, prefers (I suppose) that I let the character's interaction dominate the movie tone; his screenplay does not help, so it's not clear who we should sympathize with. Small, random moments work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black, Dern attending Tepper in his bedroom, all the scenes on the pitch), yet the whole third act of the image is an intolerable mess. They try to put together an important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson has no style in his craft (nor does he get points for chuck, since his production on these events is embarrassing and ugly). When the director gets out of his way to humiliate his actor, he needs to ask his motives. Perhaps, if "Drive, Sa Said" eventually made a strong statement in the store, the audience might forgive the filmmaker for his judgment and taste to be protected. Unfortunately, the confused closer is just as stunning as the rest of the movie. * 1/2 from ****
