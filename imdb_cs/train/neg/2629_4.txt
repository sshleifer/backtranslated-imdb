Hollow point is a good movie worth half the price or when nothing else is in good time without thinking. There are explosions and hammams and actresses and pretty ladies. A pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast plus a light heart touch do not a great movie but a fun one .. on a scale of one to ten .. 4
