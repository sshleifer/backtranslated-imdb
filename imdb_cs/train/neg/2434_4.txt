Realistic movies, of course, except that the characters do not look like fear. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not look. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger again plays a soldier. No good excitement, realistic sequences. Not always shoot, that's one great thing. Well shot. I hate the helicopter sequence, because only one terrorist kills almost the entire sea bunker ... I give it ** and half of *****
