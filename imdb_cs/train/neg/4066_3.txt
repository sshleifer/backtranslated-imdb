In Erica Stanze's "ISOYC, IPOYG," three men are tortured to women who are sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat her own crap before being transferred to death. The following guy ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first person's body. But it's the third person who gets the worst: he has to watch the tattooed "star" Emily Haack, naked and masturbating with a broom handle (oh, he also gets the handle pushed into his butt!). > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , that Haack, who is obviously under the defective view of having the body of the goddess (as opposed to having a road for Metallica), is constantly getting behind the naked camera. It's not a nice look. In addition to constant nudity from the stacked haak, viewers also see the dire direction of Stanza (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees are fun stuff), some really bad acting, and a fat boy's a penis. <br /> <br /> Special, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' rating 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. This is one point for a dirty ax attack (which, like a gore-hound, I enjoyed); one point for a piece where a fat boy gets his face pushed into a chocolate foam masquerade as feces (merry); and one point for utter nerve suggests that this film could in some way be a continuation of Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation of the classic I Spit On Your Grave.
