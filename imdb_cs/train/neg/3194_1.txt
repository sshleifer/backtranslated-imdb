I can not believe that this film was shot in 1984. It's a little ridiculous acting, not to mention one of the most stupid land ever. Who would ever ask fat Texas Sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort the Italian illegal arrest in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the name of the movie does not tell you anything about it - in fact, it's a generic title for a movie / cop, as I think. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw it only on MST3K with Mike and boots as a shield. They note that female lead takes the form of Elaine of Seinfeld ("none of them is spongeworthy") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This film is probably not worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I wish I was illiterate, so I would not have to read it."
