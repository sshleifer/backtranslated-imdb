This movie is not as good as all the films of Christ I've ever seen. And I am very surprised that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus when Scripture (as well as other films) provides otherwise. There is also a very important question: Resurrection. None of the other films will miss this very important part: the faith of all Christians lies precisely in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is in vain." A very impressive scene for me in this movie saw on the streets the remnants of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and against my Jewish commentator, Jesus was not a toll. And in fact, it was also JEW. There are plenty of documents (kind and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or I should say that God has become a human being) who has actually changed mankind. I strongly recommend him (as a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most famous Jewish commentator of the 1 st Century.
