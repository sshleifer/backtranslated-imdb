After watching KHAKEE I felt like getting to watch another good movie but sadly The film is a joke and in fact trying hard to imagine Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is a producer of the RKS so he talked about the film during the promotions that the film has meat unlike of movies released at that time, I wonder what the movies are talking about about the film is actually a typical Masala movie with a lot of comedy, romance, action all mixed up <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> boring movie <br /> <br /> Music is bored <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to get his role all done, he does his role well, although it is not the best even though he too circumcised his face when he pulls the trigger makes a strange look led zatímco zatímco zatímco d d H je je je je Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Ak Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and the hamsy Aryeman seems flip-flop, trying too hard but exaggerating it in some scene < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
