Some have mentioned here that this is the WORST ELVIS movie ever produced. Well, they are only partially right. For me, it's the worst movie all the time! I have never seen anything so cruel and insulting and disgusting and against human nature as this film. The real embarrassment to the film industry is not that bad, it's good. There is no camp scary fun that should be here, as in some other bad Elvis movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten that he sits through his painful. Clean rubbish. Native Americans should sue for their bad clich√©s and stereotyped treatment. In fact, maybe all human beings should sue for crime and abuse this film for the whole 0 Stars, seriously. Step: F
