I never thought the movie could be so cruel, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrifying acting, horrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was terrible and when it comes to silly sex / killing the scene in one, it was a bad step to go. It was really shocking and it is not a compliment! How can someone film this movie, watch it back and then say "Yeah, that's a good movie People will watch it" If you did not see it, please do not lie :-(
