Tarzan ape Man is a remake of the film in 1932 at the same time, and like the previous movie, he has little to do with Burroughs' literary character. But while Tarzan from 1932 was reduced to "Tarzana-Jane", Tarzan, who played Miles O'Keeffe, did not say or think. He makes Tarzan scream several times, which sounds like it was sampled from the previous movie. No, Tarzan plays the second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather like the third banana to the left ring of Bo Derek and the right breast. This movie makes no sense but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the movie are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that nobody cared. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Tarzan has an orangutan side-shot in this film. Perhaps the car has merged from Sumatra with Indian elephants, which are also on display.
