Far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly unpleasant to sit down. The lonely loser high school, which is constantly selected by classmates and rejected by the girls, ends up walking on their trailer basket that has sex with a drunken slave. Then he climbs him to the nearby cornfield and kills him. Obviously the child's soul was transferred to a scarecrow, which then kills the killing men who tortured him as well as the teachers. This scoundrel, except that he has a fragile rim for each of his victims, can also air in the matrix and kill people on the sidewalks in bright daylight. Also, why did he always look like a corrupt corpse? Like the two unnecessary sequels that followed, it's not even meaningful.
