I simply can not believe that the number of people compares favorably with the first film. It made me leave this comment! It's just an obvious attempt to take over the success of the first film. The dialogue is scary and not as authentic or convincing as the original film. The story is ridiculous, the portrait of the French police ridiculous and the Doyle miles away from the first movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Simplicity that Doyle finds his guy is simply pathetic. Just like all French policemen just drink coffee until Doyle returns from America and does some police work REAL. That's a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and discover the biggest crimes on the site with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really horrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
