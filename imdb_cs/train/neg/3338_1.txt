It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think that during the 9 years, someone would say, hey, this movie is terrible. I've seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and fictional. The abused child turns into a serial killer. And something new to change. How does an abused child change into a florist? At least it would be a new turnaround. Why do everyone with a camera and film idea (especially imaginative film ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that this film has been completed for 9 years. This shows the tenacity and the spirit. With this type of drive, hopefully they will be able to focus on a better scenario. To see an unsuccessful experiment in Indian film written by a writer / director from Michigan, see Hate Minutes. If you want a good film from Michigan writer / director to keep Evil Dead.
