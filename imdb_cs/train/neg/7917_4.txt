"Cement" is a bad film about a bad policeman (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition that has a bad guy in the wrong way up to his cajons in fast-drying concrete. While waiting for the cement and film to dry out, to find out what's going on, we are regularly tormented back in time without rhythm or reason to keep track of events leading to cement. Bumpy junk, "Cement" suffers from a lack of story, cluttered execution, and the most ubiquitous film mistakes; no reason to care. In time, the killer for the right potatoes is fine. (D +)
