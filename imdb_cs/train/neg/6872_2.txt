This show had pretty good stories, but a bad dialogue. The main character was especially annoying. It is quite clear why this show was canceled, though, like most of the UPNs, I never knew she existed until she was in a syndicated re-run. Most of her land seemed to be copied from other shows and films, which led me to the idea that the producers had no original idea in their head. <br /> <br /> I did not get enough comment. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for the 2001 show. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a nice character.
