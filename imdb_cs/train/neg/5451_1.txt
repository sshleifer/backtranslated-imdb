Filmfour will have to do much better than this little bumpy movie if they get the right reputation. The film is located in Glasgow (although only a few secondary characters have something close to the Scottish accent). The assumption that people who live do not get anywhere and they all meet in the same cafe in the morning when they have work at night, they can prepare for a really fun, invisible, unusual, cultured film. Instead, we have a group of self-possessed saddles and a conspiracy that has been done a bit, I am surprised that it was not forbidden. X and Y are friends. X is asleep Z. Y is also sleeping with Z. Ah you will solve it. <br /> <br /> The total loss of time. The painful dialogue - sounds like something a group of 16-year-olds wrote for a dramatic GCSE project. The female figure was totally useless - just written as a female token in the hope that women would want to see it. If you are such a rough boy who laughs at beer and can usually find you wandering in packs by shouting on Saturday night hours in the untouchable city centers, then you will love this movie and find it a "true laft". Everybody else, go, do not go away from this justifiable oppression. And one question when the band left the "boring" seaside town (Saltcoats accidentally, though they changed their name to the film) to return to Glasgow, WHY did they do it through Forton on the LANCASTER highway in England?
