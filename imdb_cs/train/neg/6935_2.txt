Was it a comedy or was it a drama? I started this review by asking this question because the movie I just witnessed, Hollywood Shuffle, was neither fun nor rather dramatic. While it tried so much that, due to this lack of definition (comedy or drama), clever motives and bad remarks were lost. While I firmly believe that there is too much racial profiling in Hollywood, I do not believe today that Townsend's directorial debut has stopped much. Instead I feel more fuel added to the fire. Townsend's comedy timing in this movie was disastrous because of the elements he was supposed to talk about, instead of promoting himself and vice versa. The parts that were to be serious were somehow destroyed by a bad lack of comic comedy. Townsend had a decent concept with this movie, but unfortunately it's executed, which eventually hurt the movie. If you look at a preview of the movie (which I'm constantly doing), you will immediately get a bad impression of what you will see. The preview creates a very intelligent, comedic film that boasts the intelligence of the audience, but the real movie can not be further from the truth. The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not the story itself (because of lack of processing); that's the direction of Townsend. With this film he had a wonderful concept. Take advantage of Hollywood, which uses our race. Dignified idea, but why could not he do it very well? The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic. The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a hospital monitor, literally everywhere without a warning or map. It was obvious that Townsend had something to say, but there was little time to do so. Instead of defining his characters, he developed his motives and actually created an intelligent film, throwing it together and praying that it works. Unfortunately it is not. Instead of a clever comedy, we have a lot of ideas, comic sketches and unused actors that this movie goes from decent to almost impractical. What Townsend most pains is his short attempt to attempt to be humorous, interrupted throughout the movie. From the fight with a villain, known as Jerry Curl, to parodying Siskel and Ebert, Townsend's attempt attempts to talk when he talks about the film industry. This is because these little interrupted sketches actually divert attention from the central focus of the movie and really destroy it internally. While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about living in Hollywood, he really just joins every stereotype and clich√© in the book. What could become a beautiful satire will turn into a generic humor that never seems to be the other. <br /> <br /> So, if you are not in the humor of this story, some Wayansi Brothers are around to help spice up this boring story. POORLY! The Wayans are in this movie, but Townsend proves that it has the ability even to bring the worst in this fun family. Surely in moments when we live in colors before buying, we see that comedy is something that needs to be constantly improved. Maybe it was Townsend's direction or just maybe this horrible story, but these typically comedic comics were apparently not used and ignored when it came to critics of this film. I just thought that thanks to the talent that Townsend had to pull out of Hollywood Shuffle, it would be a fun, clear and real sting on this obvious Hollywood dilemma. Unfortunately, none of that. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that this is a feature film. There were a few moments (when they were few and far), which had a smile on my face, the end product simply did not satisfy me. Townsend may be funny, but in this movie it just seemed like he was playing against each other, rather than through his personal experience and trouble. I realize he's probably telling the truth, but it's never been. Instead, we went through a faint story that relies on idiot flash clips that might have worked for the sitcom but certainly did not work for this movie. Even for those who comment that it was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film, I would have to disagree. If you start fresh, you either have a tight script or defined motifs. Townsend did not have one of these options, and in combination with the inability to control his actors, he simply failed in the flame flame. Overall, it was somewhat disappointing when I watched. It reminded me of the Bee Spelling School, where your child has time to magic. The word is tough, but as the first two to three letters come out, you think it will work perfectly, but then there is a random "P" and a silent "R" that forces your excitement to pull down. So I felt with Hollywood Shuffle. At first I saw the potential, I saw the motif and the motif behind the picture, but thanks to the vague and inexperienced technique and after the first scenes I experienced the deep feeling of falling. Townsend sank his own ship, and I do not think Hollywood Shuffle has ever again submerged as a key moment in the Hollywood cinema.
