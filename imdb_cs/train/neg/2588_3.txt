Band Camp was terrible, Naked Mile was a bit better and this third straight on the DVD in French American Pie looks just as good as the predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) said good-bye to his girlfriend after losing virginity, and now joins Mike Cooze Coehmer (Jake Siegel) to Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at college. The promise of many parties, a lot of booze and a lot of hot chickens in the Beta house has only five hundred tasks that need to be done to become official privileged members. But the threat comes to the eyes of his rivals, the GEK house ("Geek") led by the hunger striker Edgar (Tyrone Savage), which offers bigger and better than Beta. Once and for all, Beta and Gek are fighting banned forty-year-old Greek games that overcome each other when they beat. The last match champion is Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) who will see the people who are leaving the bra, the duel of gladiators floating on the water, they catch fat, the Russian roulette in the mouth with the cassettes old horse said, the woman wears and drinks full barrels of alcohol (with puffs not exclusive). Everything comes to sudden death, as she dancing dancing, and she has to defend herself from cumulation. Beta House wins when Edgar jumps with a girl dressed like a sheep on her lap. Also playing Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The size of the nudity is very slightly elevated, as well as the roughness of the jokes, and I could have guessed that one star out of five is rated, but I like it. Adequate!
