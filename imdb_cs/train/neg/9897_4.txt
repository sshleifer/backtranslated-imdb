I've found it a good movie to help you make your time, but not any historical value. The Cleopatra rendition reminded me of a cheap soap opera. The acronym is ... funny! She was born while feeding her people!?!? Oh, please ... The pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to another for this reason! They tried to appear as holy for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murder to her sister ... without a description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based on everything except her feelings and morals. Everything was done for two reasons: strength and self-observation! She was in a family where she had to struggle with survival, something she did very well. Everything that was on the way was either murdered (her brothers and sisters) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately, Octavian was too strong to kill, and too ... homosexuals have seduced. So he was the end ...
