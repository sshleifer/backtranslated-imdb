I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig when visiting the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX. However, I wanted him to get out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ends. Big Rig consists of several "large platform" drivers who want to deliver goods across the United States. Characters are all wonderful people, but filmmakers never dig deep into their complexity as humans. Instead, the story strays the same as the maps in the film are to guide, but never. We lose most. We - the audience - end up nowhere and as the direction of narration ends somewhere but without direction, location or conspiracy. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The story is unsettled and the directors' efforts to "humanize" a group of people who consider them "overlooked" and "invisible" come as unconsciously and irritably condescending. The problem here is that of directors rather than truck drivers. Directors bring their own naive assumptions about trucker games in advance and then simply adjust the movie to confirm these assumptions. The whole story lacks tension, the movie is too long (it should be a 15 minute sketch), the big question "So what" never answers and the whole movie is one piece of transparent propaganda that does nothing to "enlighten" (as the directors call) the world about big riggers.
