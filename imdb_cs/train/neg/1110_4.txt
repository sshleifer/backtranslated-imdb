One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into the movie, and I decided it was nice. It was just after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell on his horse from the tree to return to a good guy. I was quite horrified by the trick of Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20, which was not transformed at all. Obviously, the name Coppola in credits could not do anything to ensure success, even with more than one. <br /> <br /> If you do it until the end of the movie, you probably end up asking the same questions I did. What exactly was a hook with gloves? What's happening with the rodeo script? Who should represent the Aliens? Why did they shoot this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue, but my energy was exhausted. Look, there's a Western name "The Gunfighter" since 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching that you feel so good that when you look at being unwell. What I can recommend.
