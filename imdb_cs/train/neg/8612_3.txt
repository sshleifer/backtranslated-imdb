It was an observable movie, but the conspiracy was a bit weak and most of the jokes came from some of Rodney's previous films. He said it was worth watching. I gave him 5 out of 10. So basically it's one of the movies you do not get out of the way to see, but if you find it on the tube, make a chance.
