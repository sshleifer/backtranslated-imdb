Okay, I saw this movie twice, I studied it hard on the Internet, I asked for a few opinions. I even went on to read the original Sheridan Lafano Classic 'Carmilla', the book on which this film is to be based. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe the game that is played during the watch. As it seems, the story of the movie does not make any sense at all, there is a plot of the book. Laura lives at Syberia Castle with her father, Mr. De Lafontain. They continue their lives blissfully and calmly. One day he will receive a letter from the "general" of the man who did his mission in life to avenge his daughters of death. He claims that supernatural powers are at work, and explains that he will soon be visiting. Meanwhile, a random encounter with a strange woman leads to the fact that Lafontains take care of her daughter, Carmilla, for months. Soon Laura begins to overwhelm strange dreams and begins with a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what about Laura's state and general? I invented this game and I would like to play as many people as possible and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and I would have some sound, but I can not bother. It's called "this movie makes no sense". <br /> <br /> All you have to do is try to come up with a complete conspiracy while watching the movie that explains what's going on. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, totally complete. <br /> <br /> It must answer such questions as ... <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires walk day after day in the world? Why are all lesbians? Why is a girl named Bob? and why are they filming? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it real? * Why zombie killing seems to be an accepted part of life does not mean that someone bats the lid? Why does Travis Fontaine rush and crash the zombies without slowing down while riding his car, but when he encounters a woman with apparent hostages at the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too? <br /> <br /> * And why did he leave a girl he later reveals openly that he knows is the main vampire to drive with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * Then leave her alone with her daughter in a stolen car? What the hell is the whole asylum scene? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is green goo all? <br /> <br /> * Why does the vampire suddenly start dressing as a sister? <br /> <br /> * Why are never Zombie Vampire Warriors? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of a necklace? what is it made of? why kills vampires? and how does Jenna know? <br /> <br /> Actually, it's just as fun as I try to come up with many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my story, and I have to admit it's not quite there, but it's a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> At the end <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs Zombies' has no moment in it, they are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet he seemed very willing to let the audience do it. And somehow comes out of a classic nineteenth-century horror novel. As? Why? What the hell is going on?
