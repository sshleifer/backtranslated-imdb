Oh, a movie of sex and gore. It's bad they will not do it anymore (if you live in Japan). But if it all turned out, it's not a bad thing. The film basically consists of two beautiful vampires who choose "johns" on a rural road, take them home to their castle, have crazy sex with them, and then eat them (except for the first victim who stayed for no special reason) . Things are complicated when a woman with a campsite with her husband becomes too curious about the mysterious women she still sees. That's why it really scares. Eventually there are two vampires in such blood that they eat everything in sight and can let their captured victim escape. Oops, so much for the secret existence. The fact that both vampires do not mind taking their clothes and deceiving themselves is the only thing that this movie is about. Otherwise, it's a bloody messy mess (why is their tomb so far from your castle?), Observed in just a few moments of vampyr. The only thing I got from this movie was these two valuable tips: shooting lesbians does not kill them; it only turns them into vampires and does not rise on a rural road; they are probably vampires. Besides, it really was not my time.
