Just as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A promotional hack at the dirty end of what seems to have once been a prominent and idealistic career. Pacino plays his role as an infallible bed and attacks everyone with a totally false and inconsistent sum of southern. <br /> <br /> with so much loose ends and the improbability that the mind leans (and then recedes). Kim Basinger is there, he does not do much. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. It's hard to believe they meant a lot to themselves. There is no energy. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, lights up the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie, but they were not enough to save Ala from embarrassment.
