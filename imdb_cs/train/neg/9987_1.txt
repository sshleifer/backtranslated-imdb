Turgid's dialogue, weak characteristics - Harvey Keitel Judge? He plays rather as an impractical hitman - and the plot conspires without plotting to become one of the dysfunctional films of all time. You apologize for the cast because you are trying to make a comedy from a terrible and indecisive scenario. Avoid!
