Super Sexy B movie actress has another bit part as the future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotty's girlfriend in this box office bomb. Marion plays, he has only one line of dialogues, but one word about dialogue actually. He shouts, "Joe!" how Ray's nature violates poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprayer. This movie is so bad even though it becomes funny, cheerful at times. The boys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 would like it! Look at the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheese-making edits and effects they do to show how bad Pia's character is rushing. Pia plays in this aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. Pius Zador as a screenwriter? Yeah, right. Pia can scarcely talk, let alone write! Pia is absolutely and absolutely wrong in this silly role. But who cares? The real star is hot and fresh Glory Annen in her piece in this pussy! Rock on Glory!
