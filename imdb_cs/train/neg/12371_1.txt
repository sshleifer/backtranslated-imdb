This movie could be great (because it has a somewhat fascinating premise), but it never went beyond the pure cartoon. The game is really flawed, and there were times when I was so stiff pressed that I thought I'd get out of my place in the theater. Never and Never Think of the fact that you've been getting a good Danish cinema in the last few years, but if that piece ... crosses the border, I'm afraid nobody's going to want to borrow a Danish movie. This movie is why I decided to register here. I really felt that I needed to take people out of this piece ... my sympathy goes to the people who had gone to the cinema to see it
