Do you have weekends in the summer? Then it is a movie that will speed their departure, otherwise it will cause the catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant indignation. The film is probably on board a luxury cruise ship, which is a more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average strainer and casts from the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting piece of added entertainment is played by "Spot the Villain" when the passenger joins the boat. You will not be wrong !!!! With a scenario that fades faster than a brick, the clichÃ©s shattered and a considerable amount of raspberry jam doubled as the blood that attempted to encompass the genre of thriller, action film and gore-fest, and failing to fill one of them. > <br /> You have to watch the movie if you just laugh at how bad it is.
