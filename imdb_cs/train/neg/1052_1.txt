***** THIS SPEAKER CAN BE REVIEWED - but this determination would be negligible in such a classic and familiar story. ***** The story of CINDERELLA is one of my favorite fairy tales. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. It can not work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photos and deciduous looking designs with the wrong direction and editing. This Cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling, or rather, it has never been transformed into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the production value that money can buy can not buy good film timing and dramatic development - or good work. <br /> <br /> Cinderella's entry to the ball was so poorly executed, there was no expectation or excitement. Writing also very nervous. Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would a girl want to marry a crazy, self-sufficient prince who does not want women to enjoy? <br /> <br /> The Turner's wheel on the role of Stepmother was an embarrassing painful show that demonstrated that one-liners more than appealing to the nuances. Even Cinderella had little interest or sympathy. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> production design. It was a pleasure to see the landscape, files and settings as the story unfolded. For some Cinderella narratives, go to two gems: 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with an obvious TV - 60 scenario, it is a look at sets, that is the best version of celluloid - bar none. The whole star has made every effort to provide the highest entertainment. Involvement, redirection and memorable writing and music. This is a classic. 2) After some time - this Drew Barrymore jewel retains a historical perspective, changes the story, but is not enough to evoke the effective development of the main points of this classic story. The characters of the principles and all supporting roles were written intelligently and worked well.
