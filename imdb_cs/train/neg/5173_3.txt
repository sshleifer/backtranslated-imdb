When I saw it in the store, I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek encounters a massacre in Texas with chain saw, and I think it costs only three quid (around $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it's worth it. It looked like directors - "butchers brothers" could not decide whether they wanted to do some artistic kind of horror or bloody slasher horror. Eventually it ended with clich√©s with a feverish sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters that are one-dimensional and you do not have to worry about what happened to them, but try to get the audience to take care of characters that at the end added a useless monologue and the beginning a film that is absolutely frank was not needed. <br /> <br /> The only good part was really in the middle / end - I will not destroy it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an unnecessary watch. It sounded like a two-hour film, but in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film - do not be harassing. To film slasher - do not worry - the movie moves slowly and nothing happens at all.
