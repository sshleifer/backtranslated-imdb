Everyone who actually had the ability to sit in this movie and leave, felt like it was a good movie, did not rate quality films. This film was an insult to watching, the high quality of the movie class, as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch project had better cinematography and I hate the passion! Dej had the potential to be a very intense very good film, but it was ten minutes before the rest of the film fell flat. Someone mentioned that this film was about the child's imagination, it's all good and good. But they could still do better things than what they did with the script. I mean, come on, india in the store. She looked at the little idol and suddenly introduced the Indian and the whole Indian story called Wendigo? Those who are talking to a business employee and she accidentally says that there is no one else but me who works here, so you think it's a creepy scenario of ghosts, but then he just exchanges for an idol and forgets that little baby. It was so terrible that it was beyond doubt. The conclusion to the left is not just about what happened to Otis at the hospital, but also about OMG's feelings !!! Why the hell I just waste time watching this! This is a step I recommend NOT to follow, there are definitely better movies that will not offend your intelligence! Thank God I never had to pay for seeing this movie, I would ask for the money back! For those who enjoyed this movie easily ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say it's a good movie.
