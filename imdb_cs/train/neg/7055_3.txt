lets start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the last person who said, "I missed a joyride." lol. <br /> <br /> Jokes were terrible. The performances were average. Something's getting worse in the movie. Emraan deserved something better. All CELINA JAITLEY was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was fine. EmrƒÅn hashmi was also fine. MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. therefore uses RADHA and pretends to love her just because her father is a music director and could help him become famous (because his father is guided by everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to the GOA to have fun. There she meets ROMa (CELINA JAITLEY) and she completely falls due to her appearance and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then that night ROMA can not open the door to her room and MANN decides to help her. If he sees that he can not do so well, ROMA will ask for help. While he is gone, MANN is able to open the door and decides to come in and sits on BLA BLA BLA bed. ROMA comes and has one night stand. However, in that one night stand, ROMA falls in love with him. This morning, don (MAHESH) will see the underworld who sees it all. Don loves ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He tells them to get married, and because he's scared, MANN follows the order and ROM Merry. Then their marriage report ends in the papers. MANN later discovers he loves ROMA after doing a music video together. He is now imprisoned between love and glory. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The film is terrible. The song "SINI NE SINI NE" is a fantastic, remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also amazing. GUYS, WARRANT AND WATCH THIS FILM.
