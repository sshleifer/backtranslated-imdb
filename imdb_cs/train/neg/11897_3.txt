Watching William Lustig at Maniac convincingly demonstrates that without the experience of Tom Savini and Spinell's compelling performance, Maniac would never become a cult hit. "Vigilante" is badly managed, with a simple thinking scenario that renders you at all times and predictable at every turn, as well as a media show of all actors. According to the "deja vu" trial given to me by this film, Lustig had seen "Death Wish" several times before doing this. (* 1/2)
