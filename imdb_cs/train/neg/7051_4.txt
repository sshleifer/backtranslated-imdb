A film about solving problems with growing up and loyalty to each other, Blue Juice is a fashionable candy for those who love surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this movie, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays her girlfriend, and Ewan McGregor plays her drug addict. For those who do not like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you will find that it takes a long time before the film even suggests it is interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of just a little interesting landscape. Plus, too many major characters lead to the fact that most of them are one-dimensional. The story is an interesting idea, but because of the shallow figures you have no idea why they behave in the situations they are in. Only the characters Ewan, Sean and Catherine make this film a videotape, which is why it was only released on a videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached the mainstream.
