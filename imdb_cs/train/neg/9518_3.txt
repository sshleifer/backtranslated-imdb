Bad performances of Sinatra, Martina and Hyer. Coarse undeveloped supporting characters. Unpleasant talcs without a real conspiracy. You end up liking more than a pancake, with more free ends than you could bind in four sequels (that is, if you care about these wooden figures at all). MacLaine is the only real estate. The penultimate succession in which the "Chicago Hood" looks for the character of Sinatra is ridiculous. Music in that order is also bad. And in the final scene when Martin's figure removes the hat for a woman he called a "pig", he almost did me to go out and find the stones I would throw over the TV screen.
