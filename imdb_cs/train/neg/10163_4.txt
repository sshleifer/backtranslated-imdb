When I think about the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" is coming at the end of the film, I recall the last years of "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between these two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> Underestimated but completely realistic view of a small town. The title is the reason for meditation. Perhaps, we, the audience is in "Bubble", because we do not pay any payouts in 90-minute running time. Respondents' reactions were often self-indulgent and condemning, which clearly showed how people can be separated to see any humanity's thread in characters so strange to themselves. These characters are the ones people appeal to as those that George W. puts back into office for a second term of office. It's exciting to consider how the fact that television has corrupted our sense of reality when watching the audience leaps their feet to the exit once the credit rolls. This film has its merits and deserves what it does not say.
