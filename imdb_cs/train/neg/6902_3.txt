Despite this film appearing in New Zealand, any hype that surrounds production is, unfortunately, insignificant. In addition to the cliché-only plot, the film is fraught with faulty actions, accents, and total lack of tension. While having an overall view of a large budget (for the NZ), the feeling is definitely a small town of Kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Did not anyone see the Brothers? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who have, will choose the similarities right away ... I heard that scenes like boys playing basketball, etc., were shot to try to clit on the cliché "boys talking but I think Oscar Keightley is considered deeply ironic, but his delivery always seems to be vaguely alone. <br /> <br /> Those who have any doubts that the Samoans culture-living in the NZ is deep , <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .. <br /> <br /> I always worry badly when it has "comedy" scenes that are set in such a clear way, you feel like you have a good moan in a punchline cliché - see that you want to be a white boy. .. I know someone who found this movi It's funny but the one one has braids in the brains and will try to pronounce her name if she offers him a million dollars. This together sums up the mentality of this film, OK, but not great, fun, but not fun ..... awaken NZ - it's not a 5-star movie despite all the shining (middle class white guilt? :-)) reviews ... . <br /> <br /> My advice? if you look, first ask !!!
