Unfortunately, I made a mistake and paid 7 euros in the cinema to watch this shallow, insignificant film. My points; <br /> <br /> The film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic Aspect: As it happens in most American films, the writer is considered to be an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing the kunef and the two names of other foods does not mean that you will understand the culture. Shaving, for example, is a sign of pure life in Asia, but everyone tried to stop the girl. Lebanese people are Christian (they do well) and their cultural forms, beliefs and attitudes are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is not ethnocentrism. So we do not do people on our first question about our lives, like the father who made it in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual Revolution of the Girl: There is nothing to say about it. Show me the 10 girls who had it for sexual awakening before I say I'm wrong. I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the genre of black humor. Watch out for Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. Black humor must reflect the truth and focus the audience on the fun part. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie?
