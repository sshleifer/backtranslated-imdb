Platoon is in the Vietnam War, because Rocky IV is a heavy victory in boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the US Army's platoon's experience in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it's ridiculous. While most or all occurrences in the Platoon area occurred during a ten-year US military engagement in Vietnam, imagining what is happening with a small group of men in such a short time (weeks) gives a terribly hidden picture of war. In the party, men are platooning platoons during a week or two in the following days: US warriors murdering civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, US sergeant killing another US sergeant, US private killer US sergeant US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + killed or injured in the platoon. For Stone, he tried to pass this movie because the typical experience of the American soldier in Vietnam is shame. The two films in Vietnam that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (TRUE Story probably the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO Bright Shining Lie.
