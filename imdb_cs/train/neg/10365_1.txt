Sad. That thriller was supposed to be buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible font, characters are less than credible. Horny Schlock !! Attach some B-stars in the terribly-written POS to try and give it a bit, but it's unfortunate to fail. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would give him word word review, it starts with "sh" and ends "it". Terrible ending, slowed down. Who writes these crap. The end of this movie is so conceived, it's as weak as if they had no idea what to do with this story, or just drained the money. Most likely due to the number of cameras in this movie. It's good that these actors are on their way out, because it would be a career killer. That's a good thing for them that no one sees it. At least one important, like future investors. It could have ended in thousands of different ways, but how it feels, I feel cheated from my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this, you will feel like you're spending time that you can never get back.
