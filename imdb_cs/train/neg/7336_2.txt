It is a very inert and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most lively games. I can only guess that the intention was to make the game as clear and understandable as possible for the audience that was not exposed to Shakespeare. But in this way - by making every line clear and every intention obvious - has exhausted the game of life and transformed it into a flat cartoon. Somehow it is really boring - a very hard performance for such a wonderful material. It is played in the best forgotten - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. But others are not so well. April Shawnham's hero is an exciting, breathing air head that often triggers victory. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the Snidely Whiplash level (though Snidley was much more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (Do you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) Not in this version unless he was disguised and his name was removed from credits. Since Joseph Papp is essentially a theatrical god, this production is not only a disappointment but also a scratching head. <br /> <br /> Do not hesitate to do so. Look at Branagh's Much Ado - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to mention great performances.
