This movie was really bad, whether you think it as a science fiction movie, a horror film or even a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. The movie looks (and is) definitely inexpensive, actors have no clue as to what is acting and the screenplay clearly shows that it was done along with filming. It is obvious that the monster in the dressing room was added because the living head was not scary at all - it was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; they have also failed (the form is terrible even at the end of the 1950s, rather funny). The film clearly shows why Joseph Greene's career as such and as a writer has never materialized; he was really bad in both. The same applies to actors who lead and support. <br /> <br /> "The most important success of the brain that would die" is its short running time.
