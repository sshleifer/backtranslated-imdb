First of all, as a longtime student of the Titanic Disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I have the right to comment on the film. It does not matter how many awards and awards she received, but it is still a terrible movie for me. Cameron had the means to create the "correct" semi-documentary film about the disaster, but unfortunately he decided to turn it into a romantic mushroom. The fact that so many people have fallen on the globe just shows, in my view, the sad condition of taste and common sense that movie critics and viewers have today. Who said that all movies should have a hero and a heroine in love? In fact, most of the real events are nothing but romantic, and the Titanic disaster is certainly not one. I feel he needs a better script and a director with a semi-documentary approach and the least possible artistic license. I almost emerged in the last sequence where dead lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who dive in applause. Is it a smart movie? Ask yourself.
