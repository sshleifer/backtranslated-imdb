I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most of them are not great or even good, this lean mass has lowered the bar for bad movies. Story: I do not know for sure. Something about drugs that makes you crazy and strong or something like that. Who are good and bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is reduced to scenes that move between people in dark-lit rooms that complain about how good the Seagals 'Mashall' is. <br /> <br /> Behavior: Wander. <br /> <br /> Voice copying ,,,,,, What was a terrible voice exaggerating ?! Could they find someone like Seagal? May also had Cheech or Chong to make voice overlays, maybe at least be fun then. This movie is boring and totally stupid. Avoid it at all costs !!!!
