Strange ... I like all the movies and films of dark humor; but he did not like it at all! It's terrible, horrible, and certainly not fun at all. Pity can not make all the plot of the film, and disgust. And it was really boring. Long blank moments fills the movie; it could be removed. It should be in another shorter format, for sure. Maybe I've been waiting too much from the crew - like filming lol -. It's also filled with overused clich√©s about attitudes and situations ... I do not understand why people like it ... "Poetry", "Hope"; nope 'I did not see anything like that! Overall, it's empty and rough, pitiful and hopeless. Oh, let this ........
