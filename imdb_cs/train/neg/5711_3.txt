The national treasure is overstated and exaggerated. Nicholas Cage is by no means a faithful action hero and this film is not "Indiana Jones". People who compared this film to the classical Indian Jones trilogy seriously fell out of their rocker. <br /> <br /> I can not really figure out which target group this movie was filming. Maybe it will be good for puberty, but it was totally absurd. I also can not imagine adults or young adults that this movie is so great. Simply put, at best it's okay. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is unimaginable and uninvited and lends what it has from the "Da Vinci Code". I recommend waiting for this movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense. The whole idea that you could easily steal the Declaration of Independence and bypass Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (without damaging it once) while fighting "bad guys" and experiencing what is to be a "non-stop action" is absurd. I especially loved the scene with a declaration in its tube, which is in the middle of a busy road, while the cars are floating without damage. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> He reminded me of the episode "Brady Bunch," where he goes to the amusement park, and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. But the Brady's episode was much better than the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such tremendous treasure, which no one believes is buried in the secret destruction of the United States, is unusual. There are literally thousands of undiscovered "invaluable" items in this treasury. Yeah, right !! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy Cage finds and read what are to be "hard" guides to these ancient quarrels are preliminary !!! Oh ... humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Voight and other actors in "National Treasure" are just as hard, wooden and flat as they do. However, when you work with such a miserable dialogue, it's hard to be a 100% actor for him. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is a good movie to be seen once. I can not recommend it for this, and I certainly would not buy it over the top, impatient hunter bats. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first .......
