I think my favorite part of this film, which is an example of utterly useless, stupidity and infertility, is coming to the top of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his free friend, Sheriff, eventually hit Melting Man on a landing on a stairwell in the power plant. Keep in mind that Nelson was looking for MM almost for the whole movie, and MM killed and ate a few people at this point (including his boss), and Nelson is well aware that MM is a violently crazy and hungry man of meat and blood. So the sheriff has a MM gun, who is and I give the film and Rick Baker's props, the most disgusting and scary object in human form we've ever seen. And he shouts to DOCTOR TED NELSON a very important question: "What are we doing now?!?!" The camera switches to DOCTOR TED NELSON and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. It seems Ted was so addicted to the FINDING The Melting Man, never imagining he would bring some restraining devices, a lasso or straitjacket or a net, or some reassuring darts, or maybe a New Age tape from Vangelis to calm the wild beast. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff of panic and shoots, Melting Man goes berserk, and gladly follows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it explains why NASA has been setting up a space shuttle program for 30 years instead of coming back to the Moon or Mars, as everyone knows, to do. I do not. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the kind of miserable, lazy writing and direction that undermines all aspects of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors really are, because the film has utter contempt for its characters. Two other incredibly painful sequences also accelerate the stupidity of the action: There is a scene representing the southernmost couple in the world who was trying to steal lemons from the grove just to be torn off by Melting Man. This scene is in the 70's cinema. I can guarantee that you have never seen unnecessary and irritating arrangements with a courageous search for people throughout your life. And the rupture of a male assault on a lady who lives in a house where he holds a horse that moves on the walls disproves any attempt to process it. (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme behaves in this scene as a redneck husband who first checks the house and never goes out again). The only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, their horse is probably luring her. And we're forced to watch her hystericals for at least two minutes longer than any film director SANE is holding. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning is supposed to beat bullshit from director and IMM photographer. I remember him from the old episode of Columbo, where he looked much better than here - no one has the idea of ​​a leading man but a solid and unobtrusive one. But no one can be as uncomfortable in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everybody else gets a little better off, except for the old couple (and close, I know they play with laughter but do not laugh!) but not too much. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a category of catastrophes "So bad you can not look any further". I was still looking at it until I look at the next 70- and 80th interruptions ("Track of the Moonbeast" and "It Live at Night") and the MST is very fun, so if you have a chance, look at the MST version .
