* Spoiler Warning * <br /> <br /> First I rated this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but in the movie there are too many stupid mistakes, making it a psyching drama that it could be. She never says herself first. After the mother's initial strange doubts (which is not credible when her mother turns out to be so supportive and loving later in the movie), the victim of rape is not alone. <br /> <br /> He is also incredibly naive when he falls into strange crew traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly ugly. The thing I find most unbelievable is that Ethan can not manage the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is a very crew leader (hey, they even say that) and people seem to think the other guy is a blockbuster, but when Ethan changes his mind, he just can not convince a single person in the crew that he's right, and that his former friend is wrong. Everybody just hates him ... why? There is no explanation for the film. How did you ever become a leader? A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when she came. Two actors from the same successful TV series ... cheaply get the audience?
