honestly, where can I start! It was a low budget, HORRIBLY played a movie, it was so raw that all of us shook our laughter as they completely slowed it! sword fighting scenes were not even swords, they played with the plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart, and everything they did was just a moan to make it look like they were trying! Me and my family were in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was The Sawtooth Island. I think it looked so great, but when we watched it at home, I almost died after the first scene. Oh and plot of film, story, script, etc garbage, I do not even know why the director and producer even waste time! But if you happen to come across this movie ... you will not get it !!!!!
