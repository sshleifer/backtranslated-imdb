If someone is a "favorite" movie, they need some serious help. There is nothing sensuous or clever in this horror. I did not see the original movie, it's a remake of the 1950s, but it just has to be better than this newer bastardization. The Major is expelled from the army for being a marginal element and ending the teaching of children at ROTC. Sadly, the main thing is Daman Wayans ... so kids are uncomfortable, painless asininity for the world. Can Wayans whip these defeated to shape? Can they get him to become a little more human? Film bombs like most Wayans films do, with only a few shining moments. William Hickey gets about a minute on screen, too small. This charming old man (best known for me as the "Tales from the Crypt" actor, best known as Uncle Louis of "Christmas Vacations") shines on every moment he is on the screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also looks like a biker that suits him perfectly. Bam Bam would not mind a bit more, but I think he played the role of "biker" in terms of military film. And then there is an attractive teacher who falls for Major Payne, even though he is wrong with the children, has no social skills, and it's simply impossible to transfer to someone with whom you want to spend time. She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure what (though it sounds "stupid" because the movie clearly shows that it gets out of the house quite often). Wayans had one glowing moment: a dance sequence where a series of moves (including a very nice "robot") and 2 Live Crew music performs. This scene was pleasant but hardly solved for anything else that made this movie a dog's hint. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. To see a movie that is lost that helps lost children to make heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is pious and really funny. Maybe if the owner of Payne fought a badger, I would feel better, but not. Forget Payne, forget about Wayans ... you can do much better.
