It was almost insurmountable for me to be a movie, but I was disappointed. After being a lover of Pekinpah cinema years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it worthwhile. The opening of several credits, symbolic for the Pekinpah fans, has gaps between man and animal, but there is a non-inferior surrounding noise among children playing in the school garden during the bombing. Fantastic tension. Then, as they find themselves on the way to another mission, Duval handbags at Cann that last night he had a STD that he found only by removing his purse while Cann was intimate with her. Subsequent laughter is fantastic, and it is obviously paid to Brian Depalm's poetry dressed for killing at Angle Dickenson's short-term expense. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film is losing. Even bring me Head of Alfredo Garcia has a stronger production value, a courageous challenge for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as an additional lecture, but when it's over, turn off the Killer Elite.
