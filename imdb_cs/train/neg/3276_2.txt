A television show from the eighties, complemented by a fresh female soul and fearless language. "Dukes of Hazzard" passed me; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of a television in New York or California; or I would probably watch. Yet, from anywhere (as a clip that accompanies an updated release of this movie in 2005), I knew it was a quick, orange Dodge charger - and "General Lee" is still fine. <br /> <br /> Hunky's cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are new riders of Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her modest short - but her exciting pink bikini can not compete with the topless coeds. Too stupid conspiracy includes the gray Burt Reynolds (like "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazzard County back into the mine.
