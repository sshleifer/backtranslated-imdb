This title is more like a movie exercise than a movie that was to be published to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife, it had to be fun to work together for the first time without taking into account the fact that people could actually watch it. I felt as if it were 90mins unnecessary when I was anxious to wait for a conspiracy that is developing or even going on. Try to paste this movie into a genre and you will not, because it lacks the beginning, middle, or ending. I have already seen movies of "art" and this is not even closer to artistic, abstract or original, but it seems to me totally unnecessary. I think he speaks for himself when the only ones who rated this movie were 10 under the age of 18. I have no doubt about the constant absurd erotic scenes that the film insisted on casting us. That's when you can call it erotic. He definitely did not like it.
