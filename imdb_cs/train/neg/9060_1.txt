Surf channel and caught it on LOGO. It was one of those "I have to watch it because it's so terribly bad" moments like Roadhouse without joy. The scripture is terrible; totally unpleasant and acting is bad. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget, and then there's a hole in which this epic should be thrown away and never seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a shelter in a rented house and the house is, well, ordinary, which is not a big problem, but they have decided to show that all the guests who are pouring it as if it were the Sistine Chapel. I apologize, but watch that 6 guys stare at every 10'x10 'boring room with a futon in it and the dizziness is lame. I think they learned something from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene) ... wow toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy it over the top, so everything is common. If it smells like ... and it looks ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid as a blow. <br /> <br /> Edit: Apparently other close reviewers believe that because I did not like this movie, I'm "obvious hatred" that I can only assume I'm a phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this crazy, insane thing and judge a movie based on the real content of the film and not its mere presence (ie, its refreshment to see ...) Sure, it can be refreshing to see but it is not equal to a great movie, just to them give some better material to work in a firmer direction. In fact, I appreciate the effort. Frankly, I would prefer to listen to my catalog in the Kitchen of Distinction rather than to watch it again.
