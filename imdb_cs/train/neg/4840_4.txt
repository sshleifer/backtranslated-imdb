This whole movie should take 45 minutes - at most. Though an interesting concept / theme, it really did not evolve as a story. Once the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Expert on bomb disposal (Cowboy?) Is introduced, And that happens very soon in the movie, the rest is repeated. Characters were not investigated and location and policy aspects were ignored. There was a nice look at the terrible troubles the soldiers face in such a strange environment and the difficulty of distinguishing between a friend and an enemy. But the way the unit was driving a tense belief! The individual performances were good and the special effects were reasonable, but they were not enough to overcome the underlying lack of content.
