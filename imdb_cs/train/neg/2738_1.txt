Baskets / bad movies are usually not bad because it will be nice for me. This is so bad that I have no words to describe - it's "bad". At the beginning of the film there is a guide that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instructions and a dozen beers could not help me sit in the whole movie. One tagliner compares this to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and insulting to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner was about to try to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about renting this DVD, put it! If you're thinking about buying, do not think! If you have the misfortune of having this dvd, do not play it and immediately put it in the trash.
