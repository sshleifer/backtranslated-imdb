'The Vampire Bat' is definitely interesting because it is one of the early genre horror films of the 1930s, but in isolation it is somewhat depressed for every real praise. The film is based in a European village sometime in the 19th century, where a series of murders attributed to vampirism by suspected local residents. It is very similar to James Whale's "Frankenstein", and this is related to the introduction of Dr. Niemann's character from Lionel Atwill, supplemented by his misguided ideas of scientific progress. The vampire theme is arbitrary, and is only used as a red heron, suspected of falling into the space universe of the universe of Herman (Dwight Frye), thus giving an apology to the artillery crowd to go rampage - as if they needed one. <br /> <br /> This is one of the trio of early horror films in which Liony Atwill and Fay Wray (also "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") play and, like their co-operation, the film suffers from bad a comic relief consultant and a tendency to get rid of the horror and mainstream of thriller elements. Stated in the context, "The Vampire Bat" is still weak and inferior. All that remains is the poor quality of the Frankenstein imitation, with vampire elements that are purely a means for fans of Dracula. But because of the title, the film will even be considered horrible, and it is worth mentioning that director Frank Strayer did "Blondie" a few years later.
