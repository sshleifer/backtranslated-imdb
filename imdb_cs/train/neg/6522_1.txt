It's not about commenting on the current movie, but about DVD RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there are different versions and updates, but the disks we rented have 2000 copyrights on them if it means something. By the way, the mixing of sound on these DVDs was terrible. Layers often go up and down; when the scene shot out on the battlefield's panorama, the orchestral song would thunder so loud that I did not know what would blow out first - my ear glasses or my loudspeaker. When it was time for dialogue, the volume would usually fall to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley's work would remain loud, while the dialogue overlapped at a much lower level. My wife and I found out that the only way we could watch this movie from these DVDs was when one of us held his hand on the remote control to modulate the volume smoothly. Just as another user noticed, when we chose an English sound, the dial continued to pass between Russian and English; and occasionally, when the characters spoke in French on the original path, dubbing was in Russian, so you are SOL if you do not understand. Finally, we gave up watching the first disk. Before you win $ 50 + for this movie on a DVD for your own library, I cordially recommend getting a hand on a copy of the rental to see if you really can look forward to this epic movie when it's loaded with bad sound, especially if you've never read a book and really want to understand the story.
