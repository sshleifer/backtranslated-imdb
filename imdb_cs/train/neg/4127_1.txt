The film is as bad as it should be removed from all the stores around the world. It is so full of boring, boring, non-imaginative characters and leading figures with such an uncomfortable attitude and a dry voice constantly bringing a thoughtless voice to every action and sensation, this film holds a record for the most demanding film I've ever watched. As I paid the money to own it, I felt obliged to see it and how I regret it. My head hurt me because of the terribly boring attitudes and their absurdities, rather less lives. A lot of kids who have nothing on anyone are all cold and worst of all, have a terrible dialogue all over the world, just dress up because the main character is trying to get a date with a girl. Boredom, so much so that my friend was trembling with hatred, and I was lost red by throwing 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the following day and I did not return much money. Avoid the plague.
