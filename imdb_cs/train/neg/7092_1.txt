<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap camera) may be one of the biggest film bombs in history. Beware: Packaging promotes the film as an erotic sexual sex survey. The film is not exploring anything, and it's not more erotic than staring at your own warts. The script is unnecessary and meandering, all the elements of conspiracy serve as segways between supposed sex scenes. However, even sex scenes are lame lame lame. With the exception of the first, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overcrowded. If you're looking for a decent film, you do not want to. If you are looking for sex, you do not want to. Regardless of the goal of your life, desire or perspective, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashii Kinski and Ed Begly to eat in this crazy bomb is in an extreme mystery.
