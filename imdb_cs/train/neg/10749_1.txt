This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are things that immediately jumped to me: 1. The woods were more like the hills in Los Angeles with several trees and a brush. It's not scary. Flash news if you shoot in Southern California, a big bear is just an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. The script was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I've ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was non-original, clich√© or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lame), clown name is "clown killer" (lame). What's a boy in the woods? Was that the only mask they found? 3. The last, but the smallest, was acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever gathered. Virtual jostling of dirty lines and bad gaming. The worst part was far from when she accidentally returned to this fat foreign girl naked in the photo. It's a really long scene and I think she was supposed to be sexy, but she was not. Also, and it was one of the few pleasant parts of the movie, this instrument was meant to be "athletic". For example, when he's bored in the movie, he picks up a couple of rocks and starts curling with them. Later, he has to follow a clown and immediately, with his very "girl" running, he is quite far from athletics. Oh and the girl who played Kat, the good Lord stopped singing. This song you sang for credits will make me kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, I recommend you at least watch special features. A group of fools who made this film as if it were a truly original story. One of the girls actually says she let some of her friends read the script, and none of them could predict the end. They seem to hang out with strange children.
