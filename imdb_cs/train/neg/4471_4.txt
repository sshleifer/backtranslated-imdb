The best I can say about this movie is that it was fun sometimes and that it was a good time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I wanted to dress these characters. It's such a movie that is so sweet that it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I think, but things are terribly tiring when the dialogue is so uncomfortable. When both electrodes are not on the screen together, it is not really bad at all, but be afraid during the frequent moments when a loving couple starts talking to each other.
