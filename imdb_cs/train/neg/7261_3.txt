This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain as a result of the unexpected phenomenal success of the Italian Spaghetti Westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, represents an eclectic array of established and emerging International Stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas , Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, however, this incoherent disorder of the movie serves as a brilliant example of why most American film genres became in the 1970s a dying breed and today is practically (or officially?) extinct. I really wanted to like this movie, not only because the western one is one of my most popular types of films but also because it has all the features, including an interesting assumption, to be good - not to mention that my father bought the paperback edition of the novel "THE TOWN CALLED BASTARD" to relieve your original rel! As it is, the only virtue of the film (if it even can be called it) is its utter eccentricity: Stevens, for example, plays a widow for vengeance on a man who betrayed his revolutionary husband, sleeping inside the coffin (!) Riding in the carriage with his fool (?) Sutton; Savalas, as the bloodthirsty apostate who initially seems to be the main villain of the film, is carefreely dispatched by his own advertiser Lettieri very early in the picture; a bitter piece then it turned out that Landau, who is in the movie of the first scene, is seen drunk next to the legendary hero who became the priest Shaw! Fernando Rey, who plays a blind farmer, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw, who eventually proves to be just a front ... well, never. As you can see, the plot is very confusing and from there it becomes alien! The production team responsible for this film was also on another western ride in the same time period as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
