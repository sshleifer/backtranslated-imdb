I was thrilled to discover this comedy of the late sixties that looked at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, very young Bob Newhart and of course Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was so complicated that the film did not work either as a comedy or as a perfect movie. Ustinov plays a small time step from a prison setting his site to a large US-based corporation headquartered in London. Bluffing his way around was hacked by CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov handed over as a computer expert and immediately plans a "perfect defeat" part of the film. To do this, you have to go through the security system that protects the corporate hall. And here's the problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is extremely trusting and stupid. His deceptive justifications are taken in nominal value, and this must be the only computer center that does not bother the cameras. The second problem is a robbery (a scam actually) that takes place during the first 30 minutes of the film, which removes the rest of the film that is in the path of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly bad because Ustinov's next-door neighbor / secretary, who just can not keep the job. I love Maggie Smith, but she seems to be too much together, she is too compromising, that part of it appeals to a bigger swing, a physical comic. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe it's an age difference, but the later romantic relationship, like missing a real romance, is still coming a little scary. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was meant well at the time, but I found it unfunny, meandering and sad waste from a large cast.
