Although I see the potential redemption of the qualities in this film due to his intrigue, I definitely thought that the painful long nature in the way the scene took place was too much to ask most of the audience. Huge holes in the script, as never explained, "your father died today," commented the mother, making it even harder to try to make sense of these characters. This won first place in Cannes in 2001, is a shock. Perhaps the French were starving for the film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device that would keep the viewer as unpleasant as possible, but when faced with the inability to get in touch with the main character, it was too far for me to keep me at hand from the story altogether. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is just a movie for the rarest fan of the movie noir and a person who does not expect any pleasure from watching the movie once it's over. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were more disturbing, but at least brought something to the viewer in the edits and steps. Watching this teacher slow down, and the painful quiet scene behind the scene became so redundant that I considered it tiring - and I really wanted to enjoy this film at every step.
