The film is inviting to the public due to the charisma of Ben Stiller and the renown of J. Aniston. It seems that we have a recipe for a successful title here, but nothing is successful in this movie. <br /> <br /> Anylon is very well played by Polly, no doubt. This is the kind of character that suits her perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same unpleasant guy as in "Meet Parents," but in this movie comic scenes are little compared to the above title. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor and nothing special. With the two well paid actors, things could have been much better - but what they can do if the story and the script are so bad. 4 of 10.
