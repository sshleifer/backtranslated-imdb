Unknowingly, this film was on my shelves for a while in the Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to watch it; though he did not expect much. When I start to find loans, I am surprised that this film was filmed by Filmirage. Filmirage brought the world such amazing traitors like "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword," so I was forced to watch. the potential to be decent, although it was non-original. Gore scenes could be improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after some time he started pulling the film and I realized that someone would soon kill or better convert. At the beginning of this drag-and-drop, when I had these ideas, although someone could be killed or mutated, however, as noted, the gore and effects were not very good. It was worse that the transitions of the scenes were confusing; example: first Dr. Houseman would be in the Zoo, then he would have a glimpse of a possible killing of someone, eventually waking up in a cold sweat in bed - making the audience ask, "He dreamed he was in the zoo?". Just as the movie tempo, these scene transitions gradually worsened. I could try to say that the evolution of Dr. Houseman's character was pretty good, but by the end of the movie, he saw what the doctor had changed, hopefully you laugh - which is really the only reason he can see this movie at least once; this movie inadvertently runs like a long joke. <br /> <br /> The costume, the thing that Dr. Houseman will become, is also seen in Joe D'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword", which was produced in the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always use the same things again!
