My friend's mom worked in a video rental shop and got to preview the movies before they went out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to see her. Because it's supposed to be frightening, but in fact it's totally funny, I can say that in some strange way I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen but it's so damn fun! "WHAT IS THE CA-RACK?" I did not know that this movie was even ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... Yeah, so ... overall, the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit as much to the least) but I promise you you will laugh well. <br /> <br /> * This movie is a bit upset, but it's a good laugh ... especially the guy who holds the "dagger of despair" .. DAGGER DESPAAAAAAIR!
