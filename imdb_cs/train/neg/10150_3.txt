Humphrey Bogart apparently did not want to be in this film and be forced to play part-Mexican or be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Probably after the success of Dodge City, Warners tried to continue with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guyn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh, and ubiquitous John Litel, but they made a huge mistake when they tried to introduce Miriam Hopkins as a love affair for Flynn v. Randolph Scott and as a singer really doing bad things because it turned out to be one thing and that is, she can not sing. The story was not too bad, but with Bogie clearly miscast too, it turned out to be a poor west that was too long, and at low budgets, but in justice, the color would not help.
