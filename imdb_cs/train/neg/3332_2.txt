I bought this movie in the sale of cars, so I did not expect it to be a horror film at the same level as Elm Street's Nightmare (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be nice track. It turned out, however, that it was not pleasant at all, but instead the actor and general movie was ridiculous, such as the ways in which a "murderer of misfortune" murdered its victims, and everyone killed was just a young blonde woman. It was a stereotypical horror film. I say it for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blonde women in danger, most killed. 2) One survives by creeping around in the dark while being persecuted by a murderer. 3) surprising surprise, help came in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I saved you two odd hours by summarizing this bad excuse from a horror movie, so you're lucky enough to not have to look at it.
