I really did not like this movie when I saw him at the age of 6 or 7 because I was a huge fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was wrong. Until. The complete basket for a while destroyed Robin. I recently recovered only with my funny but serious role on Father's Day, but then made another mistake, Bicenntinial Man I think it was called, but it is. Robin should now get a much better job, and now he has returned to the slime that came out of this "classic".
