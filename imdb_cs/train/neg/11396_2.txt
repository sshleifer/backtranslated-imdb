Master of Cheap Erotic Horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" hardly borrows everything he has received before the Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but he still does it with humor enough to be able to watch ... barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper, and actors can not get out of the food bag. Put it together and you have a ball of mulch for the movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I'd like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar. You take it for 90 minutes and you have a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
