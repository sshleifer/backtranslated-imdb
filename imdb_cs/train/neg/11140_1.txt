I thought I was going to watch the scary movie ... and finally the whole movie laughed. In the scene where you changed to a werewolf, I thought she was kidding. Today's computer games have ten times better animation. A low budget is a good comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson as a good werewolf film. It has good special effects as it should be (human transformations on the werewolf). If you do not want to laugh, I do not recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
