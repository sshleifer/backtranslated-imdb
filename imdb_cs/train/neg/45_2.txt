As the number of Video Nasties I have not seen yet, this small pile of garbage appeared on the "to rent" list when I saw it available. The premise is a fashion model, or something has been taken and brought into the jungle, which should be kept as a ransom by a modest idiot crew. Some other man is hired to bring her back and get a sack of money that could use him as a bargaining chip, even if he returns with the girl and all the money, gets a distinct piece. He brought the helicopter and the pilot with him, and the pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Everyone is absolutely horrible and dabing will cry your blood. After we reach the jungle, we learn that there is a cult of cannibals, whose tiny earth-god walks through the forest like a human king of Kong, looking for the female tribes to destroy and devour. Now this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst make-ups, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's pretty. His growl and moanings are still present on the soundtrack, and I find out that I will expel most of these scenes. Oh, I forgot to mention almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was forbidden, although there is one specific scene, about one second, where God attacks a girl and pulls her courage but it is not a redeemed factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco crosses the usual T and A and shows a long close up of the female genitals and, unfortunately, even a man. So, if you want to "be fair" in terms of exploitation, you got it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this waste to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just cruelly padded baskets that are probably only seen by the Video Nasty fan, and even if you're on the list, leave it the last time. If you follow it first, you can imagine that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
