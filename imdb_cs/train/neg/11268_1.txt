I was hoping that this film would be at least observable. This was a weak thing. Obviously I expected it to be different from the cast (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?). At least I do not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behrova, but the rest of the film is a complete and complete PANTS.
