"The Second Coming of Suzanne" is one of those surrealistic films that they will try to find as sophisticated, but all he does is give the audience a sleep. As with other films of this type, dialogue is limited. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. Cinematography smells, so there's nothing to keep your attention. The box states that this film is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on the film." Yes, sure. It's where we see such stimulating events as ice bucket or turtle that walks a mile. 1/10
