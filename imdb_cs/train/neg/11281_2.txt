I give this movie an enhanced 2-star rating as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie ... roadside bar scene in Russia. In this scene, the director of the film offered me an immortal line - "$ 50 .. drink and talk," but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak more convincingly with a Russian accent than I could, so I refused to take the talking part. I was a bit stellar as this was my first film experience ... and who knows ... these lines could end up with lines like "I'm going back" and "Pretty honestly my dear, I don 't give the damn." I would say that in the Rancid Aluminum line, "Heavy 1" instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowsky will appear my name. <br /> <br /> Over time I count on the luck that my name is by no means associated with this movie. Even though I spent the whole day on a set, South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what a real story was. Cafes and wardrobe ladies all agreed that it seemed he was wearing a lot of talent and nudity ..... things would certainly be worse if I ended naked in the worst movies .... <br /> Still ..... On the positive side .... I was talking to Rhys Ifans during one break. I did not know who it was because Notting Hill was not released yet, not that it could be Welsh. Several inappropriate comments about what has become a terrible Barry Island cave since I visited the 70s and 80s of my childhood. Only when Keith Allen appeared, I found out that I was in high quality production ........
