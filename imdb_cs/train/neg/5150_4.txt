I got a DVD from the library with the expectation that I would have a good idea of ​​how things are happening in the background when the opera produces itself. I must say that I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets in Wagner's production must be sophisticated and impressive, and the story of their production and use could be an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we did with a bunch of clips of people moving around large scenery objects slowly helps with a comment that did not pay attention to me. I found myself listening mainly to the music clips from the operas. I was overwhelmed by the enormous endeavor I needed for such a production that got pretty good and I'm still in the opera, I'm sure I'll remind you if this video was - but it's been feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed comments and explanation.
