Good: I liked the movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen long ago, which I really feared. The acting was not too bad, and the "Cupid" killer was believable and disturbing. Evil: The story line and plot of this movie are incredibly weak. It was not much. The way a murderer killed his victim was very scary and disgusting. This film does not recommend anyone who can not handle the gore. <br /> <br /> Overall: Good fear, but a bad story. <br /> <br />
