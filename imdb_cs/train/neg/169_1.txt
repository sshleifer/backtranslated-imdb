I have seen this movie recently because a friend from NYC came with him. After 30 minutes, I said, "You gotta kidding, is it a joke?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the most powerful films ever made. "What was that supposed to be?" I asked. "Promotional film for children?" The story is stupid. Acting is the worst ever for most directors and sincerely people who look at this kind of fringes and think that it has to do with life, love or even death, which offers an incredibly stupid look ... needs some psychiatric help. Please if someone tries to transfer it to your DVD or Video Player, consider it as if you inserted a virus into your computer ... it will not destroy your player but will destroy your evening. If they did Razzies in the 1940s, it would have won in all categories. (PS, it's also under the dubious sobriquet "Stairway to Heaven.")
