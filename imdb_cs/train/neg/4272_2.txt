These kinds of movies, when the psycho of one or the other determination attempts to damage the reputation (and eventually totally eliminate) a naive person to take over his life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, Hand Cradling the Cradle, One White Woman, and a thousand films made for television. But while a few, especially fatal attractions and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, exciting characters or a few plot plot, illegal entry plays everything in the book. And it was not the acquaintance of his stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), the film would have fallen to average more quickly than the miniseries Danielle Steele. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, a constantly naive guy who calls for the help of two officers when someone penetrates his home and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he feels so angry that he feels so powerless in such a situation as a poor cop (Ray Liotta), typically a psychopathic villain without limitation of his power. Initially, he empathizes with Carr (probably pretending to do so), the cop is approaching a few. But early police officers want Carr to break the life of boys in almost any way (which is very easy when you are a policeman and when you are a policeman who installed the security system of a man's house) to take over and probably get his wife. He appears to be less end-oriented, and rather as a policeman just wants to prove his power. A woman is a trophy, in other words than an end. And the story plays entirely in the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of those movies. From a "shocking" moment, our main, naive character realizes that he is the victim of credit card fraud (committed by a psychopathic villain) for being a really dead end.
