Ok, so of course the PPL thought it was a good movie in 1955. Love that fools who still think it ... Its absolute rubbish. The story is simple. .. ridiculous. Characters are absurd cartoons - but this film is not meant for satire, it's sure it's a serious course, is not it? Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he played his part as well as he could. Its character should be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made the film. See him agonizing and throwing small bouts like a 4-year-old boy ... his pathetic. Natalie Wood is wonderful, but early scenes at a police station where crying and wailing are very unconvincing. It sets the wrong precedent for the film ... and for the rest, you feel like you cross each time one of those badly acting emotional scenes appears. Maybe it was good for your time, but it really is a disgrace. <br /> <br /> It has to be just a humor about Dean's death, which has the supernatural reputation of this film.
