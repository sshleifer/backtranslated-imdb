Hello, I'm a friend of the werewolf movies and when I saw the Darkwolf title that hit the shelf, I was like "hmm, simple and nice name for it at least ... Altha ... I wonder why I have not heard of it before . "<br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with the breasts. Lots of goats. Goats are to a large extent all of the budget films went. Who cares about the werewolf effect, just pay the actresses to get into the deep shots! So, about the mysterious figure of darkwolf (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares ...) It's your average everyday cyclist. No matter what the old wise woman looks like in the movie, "it's much stronger and more dangerous than before." Just by describing her tattooed biker type. Pretty original. I even looked twice when they first used "red glowing eyes" SPECIAL EFFECT! My God, I think, since the 1970s, the effect of "let-red dots on eyes with a computer" was used. It looks ugly! And do not let me start with a 3D-CGI werewolf. As has been said, like a bad and old video game. Finally, just like the werewolf films, as I said. They all always build their own werewolf legend. Darkwolf also builds werewolves, silly legends of hybrid werewolves, and ancient bloodlines. BUT. Almost immediately after creating the rules, the engagement "dark wolf kills someone the girl touched" begins to break randomly. Which makes no sense why they even bother to tell us the rules of killing when they are not even playing with them at all ... Aplus footage from a wolves point is made with Sony Handycam or something mostly made of floor and wall. Just add loud sound and you have a great werewolf effect. Gore is partly okay. But when the wolf pulls all open-handed, just by basically putting her hand on the victim, she just will not do it for me ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, WHO Makes Money Makes Piles of Unwanted Horror Titles Directly On Video, it's not even fun - bad movies, just sad.
