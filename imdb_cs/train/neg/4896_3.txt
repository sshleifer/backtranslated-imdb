I would start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the songs, everything was great, costumes, music, lyrics (if the translation was good :)), choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I love the crab scene and the cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But that's probably it. <br /> <br /> I got it, arty cinema, blablabla, but too much is too. Too much silence (it was an interesting hour, but two hours of hearing steps and from time to time they run down, really ...), too bored (no movie should never be boring, no matter how deep!), Too many pornographic scenes I really do, I think there are porn movies there, but really, really, really, it's too much), I really think the cinema should be for watching and this is definitely not in any way observable. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for songs.
