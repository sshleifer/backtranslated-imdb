This film could be 15 minutes long if it were not all quarrels between son and father. Very predictable. Both male "stars" need a good face! Would you like some cheese to "whine?" Two laughs ... and headaches. I understand why my mother left her husband after 47 years ... I do not know how long it took! In the first 5 minutes, I wanted to turn off a movie that would have me never pay $ 3.99 to watch it! The film did not work well and was painfully long. I was still watching my watch and hoping time would fly faster ... No. The script had so many repetitions that it must be easy for the writer to fill in the space. A positive note ... the landscape was nice, falling like my favorite season. The car, 40 Ford was also quite nice. This movie gets a D rating that is near F
