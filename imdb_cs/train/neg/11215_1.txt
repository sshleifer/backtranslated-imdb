Well, first, this movie looked pretty good even though it was moving pretty fast and although it only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was good, but if you found your sister dead in the lake and found out who could kill her, why would you go hunting around him and pull the gun with one bullet and lose it and finally you run away from it every slowdown and let yourself be killed? Moreover, when you found your sister dead in the lake and found a trace and found out why he was a murderer, why would not you give it to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she behaves like her sister, who was a waitress, and she talks to a bad guy, she should meet him somewhere and say she's dead and what happened to her "proof". I do not know I was not happy with the end. This movie could be much better if it took longer and the acting was better and if the end was not so radiant! Do not waste money on this movie because if you do, you will also write a review and you will not be satisfied.
