MY BROTHER TOM Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> After an episode of sexual abuse in the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw), who meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has his own secrets, no less disturbing and much more dangerous ... Dour drama, induced by courageous performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two ghost relatives immerse in the mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the "real world." Unfortunately, their friendship is melting like a harsh reality, starting to penetrate, which leads to an inevitable tragedy. Director Dom Rotheroe and shot in a digital video format looks like the movie looks torn in places (too many clumsy details and careless handhelds are moving) and it takes a while to find its feet, but dramatic payouts are quietly rewarding.
