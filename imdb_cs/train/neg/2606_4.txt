Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who moves with aspiring hacking writer Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely upset her life by claiming her "doppelganger" or evil twins to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This silly horror film is hard to take seriously, even though the filmmakers and the actors themselves seem to be dead. "Doppelganger" is confused, with some unpleasantly stupid dialogues. Some viewers notice that Drew's character comes from Audrey Hepburn's role in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and that the name of Newbern's character is a play in the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (actually trying to rewrite "breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not !). I suppose he deserves credit for not being your typical horror movie - I think writer / director Avi Nesher really seems to care about his characters and gives his film more plot than the standard fare slasher. After a stupid villain-explaining-all-on-a-confrontation with the audience, the film continues to present a horrible, top-notch peak that must be seen as credible. This film certainly does not include gore. But hey! Drew kills his mother in this. No, I do not care. Jaid Barrymore appears at first to be forcibly defeated. Drew is always very attentive and very sexy in this. Newbern looks like a nice, "nice" kind of guy. But the top of the movie must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun who started a sex shop with the phone (!!!!!!). /> The movie is basically unsolicited, but rather fun on a dirty, sordid little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
