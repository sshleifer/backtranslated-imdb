It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened to The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it's done with another classic of the 1980s Wargames ... :( Why, oh why why Hollywood never learns </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Those of you who did not see the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy , it will go to rent / buy it now .... Hardware may look like a date, special effects are not new millennium, but it still takes this waste on your hands down .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived in the 80s when hacking became sexy, the internet was something mysterious and your discs came out like an 8 "diskette, and now we have the wisdom to avoid this film as a thermonuclear war! <br /> Never before was not a "nice game of chess" better choice ....
