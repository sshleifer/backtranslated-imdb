The main aspect of Superstar films in his later stages was the frequency, the gap between one movie and the other. As a well-known star of South Indian cinema, the feedback he received before the Baba was great. Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films that had worked as a mass hero in Tamil for 11 years, only 11 were exactly 1 per year. All were a big hit. It was an image that many people thought could not be easily relocated. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he got into hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in southern India, were ready to see a movie of any kind with their superstar in action. The Tamil cinematographic industry has therefore decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought the fans would take what they would do with Superstar. But it clearly did not work in this movie. As usual, media enthusiasm and fans' expectations were out of bounds. <br /> <br /> Rajinikantha's painting was totally damaged. Fans went nuts. The movie collection does not meet the expected level. The reputation of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was A.R.Rehman's songs. Rehman is known for composing good music for some of the worst films like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnaras, etc. Well, I never thought this movie would join this league . > <br /> You feel very depressed, not because the movie was bad, it's because the superstar is a snapshot. It took him five years to come back with the two films of Chandramukhi and Sivaji and return the fans what they are really looking for in the superstars movie.
