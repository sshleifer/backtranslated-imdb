On the glorious days of the nineties (God rests his soul), you can turn on a great Central comedy at any time of day and watch the biggest comic show of all Saturday Night Live songs. It was a famous show, whether it was original Players who were not ready for Primetime, or the second golden age of SNL with big players - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then it all went to hell. For the first time, I was MadTV a year and a half ago, and I think I had to run away from the shock. How can such a terrible show so long? There are so many terrible deficiencies. I think I'll start writing. Writing for the most part is terrible. It's nothing but a humor in the nursery bathroom. Cast is largely without talent. There are a few sketches I have enjoyed, such as some of Mrs. Swan and Stuart, and there are several talents, such as the wonderful Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just a comedian. Though there are a few thin ha ha moments, it is not enough to redeem this endless line of terrible shame inhabited by mad idiots. Miss this one.
