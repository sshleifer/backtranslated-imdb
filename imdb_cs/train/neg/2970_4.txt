I'm back Batman movie and TV fan. I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies. But this movie is not as big as some people hoped it would be. In my opinion, he is very upset. I think the problem was that it was not a drama. Batman: The Mask of Phantasm and Batman for: The return of the mercenary had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. I also think this movie has light for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit dark is a big fight with Bate at the end. In any case, it's a good movie, Batman. I just leased it.
