This movie looked interesting; A few years ago I read the book and informed me that this feature got quite well. "She started watching it and almost failed to meet the expectations from the very beginning. In fact, I did not bother to watch the whole thing ... the complete sound - bad performances, bad acting and instantly enemy characters - it was instead of the movie, I think. /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in my mouth and put me downer for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
