I think this movie is based on a true story ... It's about two young girls who are harassing an adult man for 48 hours; I do not see where the horror is playing here ... There are some "strange" and "unreal" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play (it's just a bit over the top). The movie is not good and it's not terrible, it really really dated! I think the thing drips down to the 70s ... It's not too bad if you like such things ... do you know ... that thang?
