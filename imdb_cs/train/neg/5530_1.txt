One of the many problems with this film is the worst continuity; and re-editing it on VHS for university cable channel many years ago, I tried to find out what exactly happened. It seems that they actually built a much longer film and eventually cut it to standard theatrical performances. How long? filling all of the holes in history as we have it will require another three hours of narrative and character development - especially since the movie we have is just so slow and so serious. <br /> <br /> This is stunning; what would Halperins try to achieve here? Their previous film, "White Zombie," was a successful low-cost attempt to duplicate the original Universal Studios Monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and as such stayed close enough to the zombie mythology North America knew from popular magazines. It seems, on the contrary, that the zombie uprising is an allegory for the policy of modern warfare. This would not only explain the opening and change of Dean Jagger's character to the megalomaniac, but also explain why the zombies actually do not really work in the movie, except that they stand around, look terrifying and wait for orders - but only alelegorical soldiers, not undead cannibals , which we all came to love and angry zombie films. I am the same as someone in my resistance to the modern war and its politics - but I think the film should be fun first and only later educational. And surely - the zombie movie should be about zombies. It's really one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history, but not one that I could recommend, even for historical value.
