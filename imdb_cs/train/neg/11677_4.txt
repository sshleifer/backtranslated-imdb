It has been talked about the death of criticism when it is frankly not so great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same film, with tension differences. But I found "CHAOS" much more fun because it was fast moving like a stupid "Swordfish" movie. The reason why this film is more popular is that it was released in the States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the US /> It is true that this film he makes a lot of acclaim for classic films such as DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch if T.V. there is nothing else but you will probably wake up after a while.
