Contrary to its name, this film does not offer spices, so the audience is exposed to flawless food. All humor seems to be forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani games available on video, even manners. Everyone scream, scream and do strange things without reason. The premise is interesting because it is a direct lift from "Boeing Boeing" in Hollywood. "John Abraham, who is almost natural in all his films, is completely disappointed, and if we stick to morale aside, then the bizarre events seem trite." Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced players trying to pick up the film by being natural, but At least the characters of the three girls should be contrasted to bring some interesting elements, but sadly everyone seems to be helpless, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who speak, behave, and even scream in a similar way. has made the protagonist to make the three girls in their home pretend to never know about themselves, what to do with sex, what else can be done in hundreds of other ways, and that is why so many dramas without reason is not something that audiences can easily spend. movies are great beginners, and now I call it a pathetic taste for those who call sit comedy. sl for the humor of such a viewer is definitely destroyed and demented to the extent that he joins the sadistic, weird and insane type of humor, where there are no characters with whom they laugh but rather on themselves and on their own frustrations that seem to be helpless did we happen to laugh, do we have to carry such things?
