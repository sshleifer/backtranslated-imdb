I do not know what they meant. It was, I think, someone even remotely connected with this disaster. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen really bad movies and then it's. When he wrote the script, he wondered if he could give the most unpleasant dialogue than written on the screen. There is nothing good about this film, from a technical point of view or from any other point of view. Whatever it was allowed and then it should be released immediately. There are several relatively well-known names in this movie. Generally, I hesitate to use the word movie.it is more like a collection of random scenes that are not related to another and make less than 0 sense. anyway, I can not understand why anyone with this dignity would appear. I have it really cheap and I still get torn if I had this movie for free, so I would still be torn. That's absoluter 0/10
