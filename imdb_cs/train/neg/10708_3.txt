This film had the potential to be really good, given that some elements of the plot are borrowed from sci-fi shareholder THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always shows some sweet appeal with his roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball to this. Dolph plays a soccer-kicked clearing (!) Who travels to New York to receive a key that unlocks the door under his monastery, which has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He has to fight a minion, a spirit that jumps from body to body, just like JUDGES and JASON GOES TO HELL. Minion naturally wants the key to keep the antichrist. Along with this ride is an annoying female archaeologist and, along with Dolph, they are chased by those who have minions in their hands. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound fun, forget about it. Moving is very uncomfortable and slow, the best playing letter and battle scenes have worsened. Dolph sleep through his role and stifle some of the worst dialogues in his career. The cheese factor actually rises at the end when the minion fights against the machine gun to control the monks at the monastery, but the rest of the film is snoozefest. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry.
