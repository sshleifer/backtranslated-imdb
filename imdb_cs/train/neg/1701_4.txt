David Lynch's crude and crude take on South Park presents us a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle class families. The father is a spooky monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular hole, from which the worst sounds of the throat are told, the son and the mother are constantly horrified, discontinuous creatures for whom terrorism is a way of life. There are a number of equally absurd characters in the whole series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie, airborne, wilderness at heart), and I'm not too fond of comedy in general. But there were several scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever pieces of animated cinematography - where Lynch transmits a wide range of reactions in his attitudes through the syntactic arrangement of shots in contrast to facial expressions (which in fact never change in Dumbland). I believe that Lynch really tried to give his audience a straightforward, though disturbing, animated comedy. Interestingly, he decided to follow in the footsteps of a recent wave of ultra-low eyebrows (most of Will Farrell), adding elements of a sinister social critique and classic violent cartoon violence and humor. While the mix here really does not work very well, it's nothing, if not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> This is what the Lynch fans stand for.
