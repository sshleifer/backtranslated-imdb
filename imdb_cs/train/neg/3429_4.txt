I have a copy from the author of this movie on soulseek. I have to say that it is pathetic and just painful to watch the two cops act, but I watched the film as a joke, and because it is a tribute to Augustus' underground, which I happened to see was in my book as an amazing film. Its quality and everything about it is bad, but its fun and what to talk about among your friends. It reminds me of three, but a good thing. I recommend seeing it under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or high, otherwise leave it. Recommended selection for sure. o and the murders are quite funny. like when the zombies tear, the faithful Satan pulls away and defends someone with his head.
