When I look at the film about zombies, I do not expect oscars or Godfather writing, but I expect the actors do not look like they're trying to read their cards and the dialogue does not sound like it was written 10 minutes before the actor reads cameras. This movie was terrible, actually I got up and left for about 25 minutes and went along and looking at Cold Creek Manor, it was not really good, but it seemed Citizen Kane compared to the heck of a bullshit. On the plus side, the girls were very nice, that's probably the only thing that kept me in the seat longer than in the first 5 minutes, actually I left after the worst man was killed, there was nothing that would interest me then.
