I'm going to UCSB and coaching with executive producer Alison Anders. He is an excellent teacher and director, so everything I call it must be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival looked like a good choice. While this film contained some nice pictures and cinematography, the lack of storyline and coherence really got rid of what it is trying to achieve. My main problem was that this was the first movie for someone and you could understand. Bad acting and even worse scenario stopped this movie to get out of the country. The soundtrack had some pretty music that made her feel that the main characters were trying to cope with the sadness that led to his departure, and now returning to the place he grew up to. I just have to say that despite some of the better crafts of the film, it is a lack of a story and the performance really prevented it from being good.
