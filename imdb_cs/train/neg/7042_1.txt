It must be one of the worst movies ever shot. Even for a biker film it's rock bottom. The minimal conspiracy includes gang bikers who take over a small town (as original!) And burglary attempts to fight them. Why do not they call for help? Who knows? Battle scenes are, of course, fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it, but both have little to do and both are ashamed of being there (of course) This movie belongs to the trash!
