Basically, the dental team of the spouse and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, acting is good and music, though sometimes sudden and without direction, is pretty cool. The problem is a plot. The married dentist rejects his wife in the backstage of the opera before performing (she has a small role) and then returns to give her something but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his desire for this episode, his visual hallucinations and macho alter-ego (his former patient Denis Leary) and his fear of confronting his wife because he will not have to "do something about it." I will not tell you the end, let me say that the movie goes nowhere and the end is like a cocktail. Motivation of the character is missing: Why is he cheating on him? She's a dentist, a decent look, a good father. The film does not say. Who does it? Do not expect any answers. Why does she want to keep marriage despite this? Who knows. What purpose do all children have to vomit? Where is this movie? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as Comic Relief) are totally useless with this foolish nonsense that does not know if she wants to be American beauty or family film. The root canal is more interesting. Avoid it.
