I like munna bhai MBBS, but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. And these high ratings really amazed me that Wat was the taste of Indian theater audience? <br /> <br /> ** CAN BE SPOILER ** An educated girl needs advice from Bhai who discuss their personal problems. on the phones comes the guy from which part of the world at r ?? I agree that movies should be fictitious, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars are good 15 minutes)
