I was watching this movie last night and I was hoping to do the best after watching all the cold trailer. Even the DVD cover looked good. As soon as I started watching, I thought like the others, "Oh my God, what is it." moments that were a bit scary, but then the mood was destroyed by stupid music. There was rock and opera there during what was to be a thrilling scene. So it destroyed it for me and I shook my head when I thought I was needlessly rent money and was a fool of art.Nothing against music alone, it was just in the wrong part of the film. Who edited the movie does not have a clue about it, what they do. The cover showed a flash, indicating they were caught in a storm at sea. It would be more interesting, but it did not happen. It was not the worst thing I've ever seen, because it's all unknown and it's obvious their first film. Another reason I was disappointed was no plot. In the beginning, two men saw a ship, then there was probably only one girl in the end, and the others were either her fictitious friends or spirits who I'm not sure because it was very poorly portrayed. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment, says it's a true story. He or she believes in spirits and spirit and says there is a scary ship in the area where the film was shot. There was no mention in this movie that it was a true story. I've never experienced anything like that personally, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I think if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you love amateur student horror movies, you may like it.
