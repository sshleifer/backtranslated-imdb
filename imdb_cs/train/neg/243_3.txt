William Russ is the main character in this film for television. He left his family to reappear and began to repay his debts. But he's trying to keep away from his family. This is where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average and really managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it to a pretty good grade. But William Russ was not really a star. But his acting seems to be alright. I found the van and the story was a lot to blame, as everything was predictable. In fact, I have almost dictated the words for the last 20 minutes before it happened. A good movie should never be that. <br /> <br /> Overall it was a sub film. In the sorting system he would get "D".
