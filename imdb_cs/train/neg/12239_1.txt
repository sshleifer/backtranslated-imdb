Since I was eight, I was a big fan. It did not matter what federation I was watching. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, that's all I've been watching. May 23, 1999. That was my 19th birthday. I ordered through Edge and I expected another salary for the outlook. But now. I was wrong. Instead it was the night, one of the best wrestlers who came out of Canada, that a real human being fell to death because he had disappeared a bit. You do not have to do much to change the situation. But what happened when Owens' death became very mad. Rather than ending paying for a look and doing the right thing as a human being, WWE has decided to protect what comes first, and that was keeping money paying for the look as if Owens' death had never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decision in his life, but it was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. And this bullshit, by telling Owen, would like the look on the paid eye to stay on. Give me a break. When someone dies for a paid look at their comon's sense of stopping. It's like a policeman shooting raiders or escaping men and then letting the men die to go home and call it a day as if men's life never mattered. What will happen. Owen will be missing and thanks for the memories of all the times you gave us.
