This early film, Adam Sandler, could have been comic compared to his life in the same period in 1989. His character is a constant recognition of his hidden comic genius and frustration over humorous material seems to come from Sandler rather than the script. The film is nothing compared to feature-length feature-length feature films such as Big Daddy or even Billy Maddison. Sadly, Sandler has not found a way to express himself consistently, successfully and fun in this film, much like his character. Most movie "jokes" come from Sandler who has interviews with himself, mostly about his unrecognized comic talent and hurt because he is too ugly and can not get women. The film is also hard to watch because it does not like a real movie. Sandler talks with the camera and viewers all over the film, often referring to the low budget or controversial film content. The film is ultimately unpleasant and embarrassing. Immediately, I wanted to forget that I was watching the film after it was over, because he feared that if he learned more about it, he would lose Sandler's career. Leave it in the video store, I borrowed it for free and it was a waste of time.
