I'm trying to compare or represent this "swill" like anything else "Hitchcockian" is an out-of-out attempt to introduce Hitchcock fans to lose $ 7 to this movie ... Weak Actor Weak Story Weak Script. <br /> <br /> No real tension, no excitement. Wait for the whole weakness of this movie for a big payout or even a paycheck ... You remain wondering what all heck was like. And please, enough with the move to make an "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend it to anyone ... Did I mention how weak is acting? Williams did a better job like Peter Pan and "Mork". But that was a lot more innocent times ...........
