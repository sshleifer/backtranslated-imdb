It's not exactly the lead of the Creepshow 3, but it's coming. He uses the same technique to use some of the same actors in several roles in the whole anthology, which is unclear. It's probably more irritating ripping from the Twilight Zone (with a bookshop comparable to the later Serlingo Night Gallery). Unfortunately, producers and writers have forgotten that Serling would be sympathetic to his characters before he overcame them. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Framing Story: Adam West is ... well, alone. Bruce Wayne / Batman's camp of the 1960s does not travel, but rarely it does. It simply plays a non-particularly mysterious "Jay" (it's a sinister name that cope with pirates that compares to Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper) and makes a slightly annoying / scary statement. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Did she see the family of Serling "Stop at Willoughby"? Then you saw it. The red watch of a wife nutso is not intended for any purpose, but a girlfriend of the main character identifies him as a wand. As well as directing, as expected, but essentially inconsistent. Nex's Diner: Reminiscence of various Serling journals, mixed with Steve Allen's "Meeting of Minds." Most actors are not too bad (with the exception of Josh Astin as Cassius, who can walk, talk and even breathe unpleasantly) and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy it's not going anywhere. The main character raises some relatively sensible questions, he's about to go (who would not?) And for some reason he ended up being expelled into a nuclear wasteland. Replay Life: It's not a bad piece and can pass both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose something says people are fascinated by the magical features of remote controls. The main character is slightly sympathetic. There's nothing innovative here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Fighting the Ghost: You see that he was twisting a mile away, but as the main character has a heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> <br /> Finale: So ... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? I do not know. And makes no sense. So ... did all the heroes go to the bookstores and get trapped? Sometimes undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!) And that guy died in the first segment. So how did he get trapped? He went to the bookstore before he died, trapped and ... did not die? What? Huh? I suppose it does not make sense because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> Overall: Basically, there is no distinction between two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Darkside or Monsters Stories. The last two stories and part two are probably worth your time. But here is nothing magnificent.
