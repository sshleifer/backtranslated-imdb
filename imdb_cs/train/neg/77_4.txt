I saw this movie in Australia opening weekend and expected with excellent occupancy Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush, that before me unfolded the definitive story of Ned Kelly. Unfortunately, despite the outstanding performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the story was thin paper .... that does not mean to read "Our Sun". Additional points were available, especially Edgerton support, Jordan's assurance (confirming his talent at the Buffalo Soldiers show), and a production design that gave the Australian bush a real sense of hardness as well as Irish immigrants from the early 19th century. But I can not help feeling that I missed another opportunity to tell the real story of the Australian folk hero (or was it?) ... in what I suspect is a Hollywood concession and a US painting. Hey, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose beard just to please Universal ... I guess I'll have to settle for Peter Carey's "Secret History of the Kelly Gang". 4/10
