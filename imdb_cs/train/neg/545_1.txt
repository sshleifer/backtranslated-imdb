it's just an ordinary Indian waste that appears as a cinema, while the Indians can boast that we have the largest cinematographic industry, but also the worst. how other poor countries can have movies with real characters that question the opinions of their respective companies, and we have just exhausted the garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, check out the brilliant films they have and get crap like Kisna! <br /> <br /> Get real people, no wonder the international community generally laughs at the India cinema.
