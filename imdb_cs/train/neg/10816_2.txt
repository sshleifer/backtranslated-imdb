Oh, what I needed, another movie about 19th century England. Which is quite similar to ordinary England, no one vandalizes football stadiums. In this picturesque setting of lords, ladies, and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg goes aimlessly like Jane Eyre, a novel that has never been read voluntarily. in Mrs. Rochester, where she is trying to teach a French girl to look at the empty board all the time. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt about autopilot) falls in love with Jane and everything, but it's still his wife's question locked up in the attic. Oops, it was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown out and some cautiously expanded the fire (probably leased a set), the film finally came to an end. Everything looked really authentic, that's something I mean. But then again, no.
