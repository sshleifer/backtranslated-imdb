I bought this film last weekend in my local film gallery. It was to buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more, so I chose this one. Bad error. The box reads like it's a really good movie. Well, it sounds like a great movie. So about 5 minutes. The film is about a young woman, Laile, who is killing and trying to save her boyfriend Jack from the bull. Lail's dad, Cordobes, is a ranch that the people of the city are afraid of. He supposed that Jack had killed Laila because he was afraid of the bull, and he continued this love to find him. That was the first 5 minutes that was good. What follows is only 100 times worse. Who wrote the script, in my opinion, had to be on a sour way or something, because nothing else makes sense what ever. Jack is on the run and finds this travel radio DJ named Mary, who gives him a ride. I think Mary is to be the Virgin Mary. You know, Jesus' mother. But who knows, I could not make head or tail. During the run ... we see bad guys, magic visions, spooky encounters, flashbacks, etc. And all of these things are done so your brain hurts when we try to find out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the film and changed it for something else. It's terrible, I call you terrible. And there's absolutely no battle in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I've helped other people to prevent the time being lost on this movie.
