After what I thought was the masterful performance of two roles in Men from the Snow River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehym in the sequel? It just was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas portrayed. Perhaps he found out how bad a plot is - Jim will return after a long absence to find Jessica, which is being persecuted by another man. He could not expect a girl to wait as long as there was no contact from him and found no competition. For the Disney movie it contains a dirty tongue and also a very useless part when Jim & Jessica ran out of marriage - very LAME. A pretty insult to the viewer's intelligence, according to my family members. I will stick with the first and try to forget that I have ever seen a sequel!
