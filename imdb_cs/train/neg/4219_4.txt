This is an amateur film shot on video, not an "electrifying drama," as a DVD is crying fake. I've seen much better things from studying students. The bulk of the story develops with a nationwide taxi around Jakarta. This movie could be made using a single video camera, but there are several sections where two cameras were used and the content was later grouped together. The adjustment is very rough. The finishing was probably done by two cameras that jumped the content back and forth instead of the correct editor. Perhaps they also made a taxi treatment? English subtitles have been written by someone who does not speak English, such as "Where are you going?" Let's say the quality of production is at the same level as Blair Witch's generous. If you are not scared yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort, with lots of cool and funky pictures of Jakarta.
