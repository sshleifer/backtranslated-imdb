The four best friends of young chowder chow pigs (with emphasis on pigs) meet every week at the New York restaurant to portray their sexual celebrations in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is a common denominator that dates three bachelors in a group, leading to conflict and inevitable "whipping". Although the movie space has potential and there are some fun moments, the overall motion does not work, especially at the end when girls do not look better than guys, which is contrary to the story base. One of the only male bands with a dozen producers, "Whipped," is likely to look forward to young men who think that "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
