"Arahan" brings nothing positive about the Kung Fu genre. Compare this fuzzy movie with the insane foolishness and quality of Stephen Chow films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, the battle scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here was earlier and better than people like Yima Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting intelligent films requires logic. It seems that it would make no sense to deliver strikes that would have no detrimental effect, as in the "Matrix" sequel. Attractive female leader So-Yi Yoon fascinated the screen, but never convincingly underwent the physical demands of Ziyi Zhang's role as he did in "Daggers of Flying Daggers". Having a martial art background is well served in Kung Fu movies. Moving the actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director who as "Arahan" proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
