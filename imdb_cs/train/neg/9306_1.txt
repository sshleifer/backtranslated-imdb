This film is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. First of all, I would like to say that the front cover of this movie is in any case misleading, if you think you are going to see a really horrible horror movie with a monster clown, you are so bad. In fact, the killer face does not look like a front cover, it's just a picture they had to find on Google and they thought it was great. When we talk about things they found and thought it was cool, there is a scene in this movie where some of the gangs are looking for a boyfriend in the old woods, and suddenly the screen moves to a scene where the deer's mother is in the shine of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ?? How is this relevant to the dark forests that pass through? I bought this movie from a man on the market hoping it would be fun if it was not scary, then would it be funny at least? POORLY! The next day I did it to my coworker who got rid of S.I.C.K Bottom line is: DO NOT VIEW THIS FILM !!!
