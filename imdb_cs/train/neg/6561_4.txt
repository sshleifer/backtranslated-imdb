The initial succession is to show that the legions arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. The soldiers are picking up a train - wearing a uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, went to war in 1914! This sure sign that the war you are about to see is a turkey. (The French army realized that the war in red trousers and dark blue coats did not work until 1915. Metropolitan French soldiers were included in the "blue horizon" and the Colonial soldiers were in kaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remake at least got uniforms more or less correct. It's really too bad for directors to make these mistakes when they make every effort to do other things right.
