really horrible ... the leading actor did OK ... a movie, a plot, etc. was totally bullshit and inaccurate it could have been as well as a sequel well ... something that had little or no meaning for Carlitos Way ... and should like an epidemic in any way of Carlit's fanfare ... no mention of Gail actually ends up with any other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how they caught him, how he ended up in jail. .. they tried to make it as an original with a flash back at the beginning ... but to be honest in the evaluation that I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately had to rate the higher ... <br /> <br /> It's terrible an attempt to pay for what was one of the best films of the 1990s ... overall it was about 6 pounds and 2 hours of my life useless ... for all the "action" in it, it was really boring slow and predictable ... again to all Carltio's Way fans to avoid this fiasco ...
