This film is a transcript of 1978 Warren Beatty, "Heaven Can Wait," but is written for the rock comedy style of Mr. Rock. The assumption remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before his life comes to an end and he makes a deal with God's deputy, Mr. King, to return to the ground like someone else. As in the movie Beatty; chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man, all because he boasts Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who appears during the murder in Wellington's home. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers from this remake and the idea of ​​turning the old white multi millionaire into the character of a black comedian who simply does not work with Son. Also, the gaps used to show Rock as Wellington and then as a true 'white' Wellington fail unsuccessfully. It was possible to improve the original plot of Beatty, which in itself did not know the notion of "life after death", but certainly not found in "Down to Earth".
