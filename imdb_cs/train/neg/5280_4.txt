Chris, the adopted son of a moral family, a loser who works in a school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin of the terrifying sweet "Step by Step" shows that ABC TGIF is now celebrating a defect) finds out he's just inherited a pornographic empire from his biological parents. It loses from the point of view of what is true friendship and love and crazy any other nonsense. You must also fight with your uncle who wants to control a family business and a clever lawyer (are not they?) A slightly under-teen teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies (by opening them HIGHLY American Pie-esquire itself), you will win moral every chance you get (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I'm really expanding the star word Martin Starr from "Freaks and Geeks" and Justin Berfield from "Malcolm on Wednesday"). It's not bad right, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < September)
