I can not believe she liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one has been so inflated. A low budget does not mean that the film must be demented. Horror does not mean the film has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a gore-fest, and that was particularly worrying. The game was average, given that all were unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The movie tries to go out as "artistic" or something. This is not one of those really great Indian movies that cost only thousands of dollars but they are incredibly well done. It was nothing but an excuse for some extremely sick people to get their perverse obsession with the film. Other reviews here also said that soundtrack was sucking ... that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some songs were written by one of the film's authors. There was no redemption in this movie. Total loss of time and money.
