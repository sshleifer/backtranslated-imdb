It's one of those dramas that is so bad that it almost hits that it's very funny that the screenplay is totally terrible, scary, illuminating the fitting, the only thing that leaves it from the real one so bad is it sounds good that the sound design is just bad; does not add any story of the story, even if it tries hard but at least does not destroy any speeches. There are problems with continuity in the seasons of door shots. And last but not least, acting is frightening. For professional production, you have a feeling that you have a university media project, you have to apologize for apologizing to anyone who had to put your names to it.
