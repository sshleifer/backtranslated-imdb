This is really a terrible movie "B". It is insignificant and often embarrassing. The conspiracy, the basic "routine creation", is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is just a justification for defeating the military effort and highlighting some popular music groups from 1942, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets a standard three minutes, except Mills Brothers, who for some reason provided two numbers. Ann Miller has not gotten into the last few minutes of the film and has little to do but just remembers the patchwork of patriotic propaganda. The most interesting moment in the film, in my opinion, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The group appears to be on the train and stand in inappropriate positions. (In the deep south of that time the group was separated in the railroad cars when traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance dived down the alley into the camera and made "Uncle Tom" shaking his eyes and turning his head as Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is truly sad. Some movies are best invisible.
