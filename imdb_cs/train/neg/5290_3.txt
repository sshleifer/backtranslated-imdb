I'm not usually the one who would fold the film. I try to see good points and not to focus on the bad ones, but in this case there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film is dedicated to Anne's pictures, while she breathes deeply and plays violin music in the background. the second part is full of bad and wooden action. Rupert Penry Jones is unimpressive. Jennifer Higham plays young sister Anna with modern manners. Anne is depicted as humble and self-made, which is good at the beginning, but it remains the same in the movie and you can see no reason why Captain Wentworth would fall in love with her. Overall, there is a lack of production with a sense of time with too many mistakes such as exhausting a concert, kissing on the street, running in the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie at all? The scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written. To sum it up, a horrible movie, very disappointing.
