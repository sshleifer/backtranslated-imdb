Everyone who is fun for the 20s jazz, 1920s dress, Charleston, and ultra-swan yachts (eg I, in every count) will want to enjoy this movie. But the sad fact is that it's all. The story is banal and obvious, it is mostly horrible, or it is played on the fake side of the march, and when everything is around it remains a lot, just the impression of mirrors and smoke. It's a beautifully made bad movie.
