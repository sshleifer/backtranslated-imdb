Budget, dignified actors ... who knew they were important. Do not waste time on this piece of junk mail. The effects are crap. The effects are crap. The only thing that could do it was even acceptable, it was a little inexpensive T & A that was emptied during the first 20 minutes. The only, even remote, redeeming of the quality of this film is a very unpleasant nausea. It was like finding the only seven people on the planet who had never come before. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, just come back and check out the old photos of the ball. The only way Bigfoot can be good is to have a big budget and some actors who did not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
