This sad little film bears little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival, which was such a "nostalgic" hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed this revival, he extensively rewrote the book. I have the feeling that the screenwriter has made such a change since the original version of 1925. In 1974 I played Jimmy Smith's "innocent fan" on the scene, and I thought this DVD $ 1 would bring memories. No chance. Even the expected pleasure of seeing "Topper" Roland Young play "my" part was the main disappointment. Three songs from the game remain and are very bad. Even the classic duo "Tea For Two" happens as a virtual solo. Many famous faces in this 1940 fiasco have never become proud, and star Anna Neagle is just ashamed. When I feel I bought myself by spending a dollar, I know the movie must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the version of Doris Day, which is actually called "Tea For Two," and it is a scene playing (the original, of course), so those who are looking for the real "No No Nanette" could find a more recognizable version there.
