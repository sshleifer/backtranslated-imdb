After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turn on the movie channels. The movie appeared on the guide and sounded interesting, so I tune in just before it started. The first 30 minutes was enough for me to be interested, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot forced me to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for playing in this movie, it should go to David Morse, who is at least trying to make the movie interesting. Overall, you do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this person as a tenant on a movie night.
