All accessories are Filipino. In fact, the only character that looks distantly Hispanic is a good ol 'Victor Argo as a very criminal' El Presidente '! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso, who is crazy as a leader of rebels. There are plenty of blasts and bodies that fly everywhere in this funny paean to the glory of American imperialism.
