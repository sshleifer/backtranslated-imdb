Absolutely awful movie. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> The background music is so loud you do not understand the speech. Well, if you really listened to it, what it says is really incomprehensible. The camera is bad, editing is not present, background scores give headaches, action is dirty, dialogues are incomprehensible, Kareena looks good like a wrestler, now looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell, you can get rid of it, but you can not get the grace. After spending three hours watching the movie I like it, but this movie does not allow me to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture, continue watching.
