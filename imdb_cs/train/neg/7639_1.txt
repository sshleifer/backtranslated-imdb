I saw this movie at the NY Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and I thought it was bad. The first and most interesting was the way a large part was shot; it is a lot of slow-moving and over-extinguished art that was far from a story - wise or aesthetically - different from showing the skills of a cameraman (who, in my opinion, was also a director). This movie seemed to be a film student with us. Leading actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but at best a mediator. and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so to bad. The story itself was mostly unpredictable. I have to admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; he laughed and sighed constantly, but I did not like it very much.
