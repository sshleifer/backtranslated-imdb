Recently, I shot such a movie and anticipated that I had almost seen it. Well, when we saw it today, the rating of 5.8 is completely understandable. I think if you expect something like that to become a desperate need, it turns out it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed story that fits well with the product itself, but the whole thing is so self-evident that it's so hard to watch. And if it was not for Wes Craven's production on this movie, it would be nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing makes you go "Is it a threat or COMEDY?" because there are a lot of ridiculous, accidentally placed jumping moments and stupid ones (IE "There's a hand in a jewel!" or "You mummy ** er! I'll kill you all the damn sons b ** tches!) and acting (God not even me STORYLINE: (This section contains spoilers, beware!) The movie starts with a woman who gave birth to an extraterrestrial child (ooh la la!), and then the screen darkens to black with the name of the film appearing and the monologue. Then we go to this office, where veteran veterans of the dummy are randomly placed. We find that it is for this one scientist to track people looking for mutants, the box for tracking the sound channels is gone and everyone is dying! "After opening the tone, you would expect more. <br /> <br /> Then go to this one military recruitment training team in Baghdad. Because the Captain is demonstrating "Good Job in Fools," their last day of training is in New Mexico, a desert where the family in the last THHE remained used were stuck. During the training, things are badly done, people are dying, and ... do I have to tell you more? Because right now I'm paying attention to the goldfish that just forced me to sit and write it. What is in THHE2 is that it simply does not work. No flashes here and the end is quite safe ... but with a twist! That's stupid. I'm pretty sure Ultra Cut director Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will introduce all of his alternative ends, but at this point I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> So, if you loved the first THHE so much, it's almost a sin that you do not see it, and then you see it all. But if otherwise, then, Avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
