GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / The Netherlands 2005). Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who finds her husband (Fedja van Huet) cheating on her, I long to face him. He painstakingly avoids any confrontation with human beings, his parents and his sister, so we have a main character in a movie that does not do at all. We barely know about its background or its motivations. Only a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley not only during this difficult episode of her life. Obviously something is suffering, but why do we in the audience also have to suffer? I almost surrendered in the cinema after seeing this inconsistent mess. It was very boring and painful for 90 minutes. Under normal circumstances, I try to prevent energy waste from making bad movies. I take a beat and throw with punches, but in this case there is a fair warning. How did Nanouk Leopold get funding for this country (largely from public funds)? Obviously, there is no script to speak. It could be offset by a genius filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with just a few more appeals. No, just vaguely defined term, "I want to do something from a woman's perspective". The result is an insult rather than a homage to a woman's view of life. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, there's no shot in the whole movie. I can not think of casting that could root it, but Johanna ter Steege is (small) light in the dark, if possible, with this terrible lack of material. I'm trying to imagine Leopold trying to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll be filming for you for three minutes, just to express sorrow." The perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and watch it late at night, guaranteed to be asleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
