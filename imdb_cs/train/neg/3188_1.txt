Joe Don's opening line tells everything about this movie. He is on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and includes Joe Don Baker, who traces the Italian gangsta. Joe Don's character is called Geronimo (pronounced by Heronimo) and everything he does in this movie is to shoot people and arrest over and over again. Everyone in the movie hates him, just like everyone hates Greydan Clark. I liked Greydon's older image, Angel's Revenge, because it was about thirty-year-old boys. Avoid this movie at any price!
