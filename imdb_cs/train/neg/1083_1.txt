This film is like real life, I mean - in such 2-hour times, it does not happen much, and too many game plans or conspiracies are often seen by invisible casts (their invisibility is caused by "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> Great drill. It's not a big surprise that Altman controls it - it's a very variable artist (yes, everyone loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" someone - Kansas City, Dr. T. and Women? Aargh) is the story of John Grisham and the excellent cast that you will sense through the gathering slide of your urgent sleep - it's really a masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "so bad that it's good". <br /> <br /> It's bad.
