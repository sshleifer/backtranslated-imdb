Marvin (Rob Schneider) has no ingredients as a cop, which is his lifelong dream. But his happiness varies when he carries the car (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment he starts to behave unconsciously with wild behavior and becomes the best cop ever to be. Over time, these changes become aware of, and his animal instincts begin to take on his human side. Meanwhile, she finds a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect master, which means she must be controlled and behaved in a civilized way. I'm not a big fan of Rob Schneider. In fact, it's his first film I've seen. But I can simply say that he is the best man to play the loser (see part of Ally McBeal, really ridiculous). There are several good parts in the film, such as his flirting with a goat. In such movies, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure he'll watch this movie until he's taken too seriously. But it is very sad to see that such films are doing well in the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I've ever seen but can not get more than *.
