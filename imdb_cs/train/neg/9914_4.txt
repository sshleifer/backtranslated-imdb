This film deals with the kidnapping of a child from the point of view of her mother (lisa Hartman Black), who acts as a man in action thriller. Unlike other films that focus on the police, her mother is watching her ex-husband who kidnapped his son. She gets help from her lawyer who finally falls in love with her. Before he finally reaches his son, there will be many bizarre events. The mother will try to take the baby that looks like her son from the local Children's play at community theater. She catches her and then realizes she's not her baby. That alone could get most people into the Mental Ward or a couple of months in jail waiting for trial. However, in this movie Mom is released after several hours because her parents like her. Moments later mom gets into her mother-in-law's home and then the police come and have weapons directed against her but they let her escape because they know her (and she likes it) <br /> <br /> The next moment in the story they found a child, but when the police arrive to search the house, they show that they left the back door and got into the river on the boat that seemed such an emergency escape! Mommy gets someone who lends her a raft, and although it must have lasted for some time (in the real world), she and her girlfriends of lawyers and police have gotten to the second raft quite quickly and their feet are water on the ground. Instead of getting out of the ravine to find his dad on the ground, Mom assumes he drowned a baby boy and she jumps into the water when she sees her life jacket. Of course he can not swim and descend like a rock. The lawyer rescues her, but they miss the chance to run for the father. At one point mom said that her son had died at a clinic in Mexico. He and he go, and where no one stops it! In some respects, this film really exploits child abduction and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman doing all the crazy things that men do in these movies was fun (or funny?).
