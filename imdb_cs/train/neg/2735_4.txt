I thought this was not the best episode I've ever seen (although my viewing partner handed me the tissue in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox out of the constantly fragile "costic state" that is, these days, just a short moment. I also enjoyed trying to place episodes involving the length of hair (or height in the case of JD) and the teens of the earliest episodes. Can I also see how Zach can be well on the way to very Chevy Chase / or is it Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical image (already recognized in Conan). A little side notes, a song (now stuck in my head) from a dancing assemble by the janitor, was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
