This movie did not get well. Maybe it's just the impact and artistic characterization, acting and direction we've seen at The Sopranos, but I just saw Prizzi's honor for the first time, on DVD, alone. it had to be completely different with the audience 24 years ago, but I must say that I was finally horrified. It is not just violence, but the mere thought that it would be a satisfactory ending. I like a good shock, but it seemed so of nature ... Also, when was this step set up? All cars looked like they were from the 1960s, and yet in 1973 the towers of the World Trade Center (completed in 1973) were clearly visible. Another way the movie has grown badly is the mere idea that a passenger can travel along the coast to the coast with a knife on his person. Sometime in the mid-eighties, the audience found this film charming and fun. In the mid-eighties, you will meet late races: only you can live.
