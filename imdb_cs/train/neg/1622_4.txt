The only reason I remember is that it turned out that it was posted a week after the brilliant QUITERMASS series Nigel Kneale. Trailers put a lot of emphasis on the fact that the main character had a crippled shoulder that I hoped would be like Victor Caroon of QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT to watch the streets of London. No such good luck, because RACING GAME is just a rather stupid thriller with the trick that he has a physical disability hero who is trying to get to the bottom of a corrupt racing investigation. I suppose if you were a fan of Dick Francis, you could enjoy it, but in the context of the late 1970s, when SWEENEY just finished and PROFESSIONAL is still being produced, something is missing about the racing game. One trailer showed the car over another on the motorway, if it was a SWEENEY trailer, Jack Regan would see to take his car and defeat creations from the debris who made a bluff while the PROFESSIONALS would take the car over and take the terrorists inside. I think it sums up what's wrong with this series
