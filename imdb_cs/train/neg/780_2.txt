This show is terrible. How is George wanting his mother's sad death? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously terrible and children should be taken to children's services. The daughter is a witch with b, and the son is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his loud and unpleasant name Spanglish. Ernie is lost, but at least I laughed at him a few times, but mainly on how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in horrible contempt. Sure, her husband left her, but how can anyone laugh at treating him as a child is behind me. Can anyone explain how great George is funny? It's not that big! I have gone from the characters because they are too horrible and it will take me for several hours, and I, honestly, do not care very much. I'm so cautious about telling one that she is looking at it and wondering if they want to watch this show because it's an incredible apology for the sitcom and it's not worth it. it starts because the wife is very attractive.
