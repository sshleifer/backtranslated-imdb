I was a sire, when I could not see it when he first appeared at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that I was going to be a handbag today, I remind myself as soon as I could. So it cost to wait? So let's go back because I gave you a plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what his way is in his life. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who will introduce him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night that Ray had completely bite, he would ask Sean to get the guy out of the way. And he goes from here. This leads me back to the question. Is it okay to wait? Yes and no, the accumulation was pretty good and George Wendt stole my movie. He just took the ball and ran with him. But it's not as close as violent as I led to the belief and somewhere along the course of the movie the ball was not just dropped but fumbled and taken in the opposite direction. I know where this happened exactly, but I can not say without spoiling the film. There is nothing to say that has happened. The end of the film will not save. Poor Stuart Gordon can not be as good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My degree: C <br /> <br /> When I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Kari Wuhrer shows his ta-ta in one fantasy and then in another more ta-tas and it collapses and ... Oh My GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
