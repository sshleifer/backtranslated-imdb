In this film, the Chavez supporters (either the Venezuelan and the non-Venezuelan) simply lie about the dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict started because of Chavez's announcement, which fired a lot of PDVSA's best workers just for political issues. They did not say anything more than 96 breakout stations transmitted by Chavez in just three days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation about private TV signals). Each of us has about 20 minutes to go. We have not told us that General Inspector General of the Army General Inspector, who is a traditional supporter of Chavez, was announced by Major General Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero. . Even despite his announcement, the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After Chavez's return, he served as Ministro del Defensa (in agreement with the US Secretary of Defense). They did not say anything about Chavez's shooting order against the concentration of people in the Pacific who demanded elections. </ br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the people at this concentration that was killed by Chavez supporters (civilians and military officials). They present some facts in the wrong order so as not to. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the Venezuelan civil society, which is even now running for elections to resolve the crisis and Chavez's actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you .... This movie is a lot of lies or a big lie.
