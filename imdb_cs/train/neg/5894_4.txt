How many centuries will pass until Japanese / Asian horror films give up a long-haired female spiritualist? It is true that they managed to launch the "Ringu" a million times, and it often worked well - which only shows that originality is not too big in the horror genre (or that I'm very uncritical and easy to enjoy?). This time, however, I was a little restless, a bit bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with an absurd length of 110 minutes. Compared with many other Japanese horror films, OMC has no atmosphere and excitement. Moreover, the end is mad: it does not make sense at all. As for the ringing tone: Miike could come up with a melody that is more effective than the forgetful little thing. Even if it was played a dozen times, I can not even remember it - that's scary. Talking about Miike, it's a commercial thing for him, so if anyone thinks they've gotten a "Bijita Q" or "Audition" perversion they're wasting time.
