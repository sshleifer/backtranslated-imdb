All the funny things that happen in this sitcom are based on the main character that Jim is either a bad father, a bad husband or, in general, just an extremely selfish one. How can it be funny? Of course, the character in a sitcom must be defective, but his character is badly defective. <br /> <br /> And why is that so? My guess is that it's because "it should be better". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and have the opportunity. But he decides not to. It's a conscious choice she makes when she chooses to play with her kids, she does not go shopping because she does not want to buy "ladies' products, and it's the choice she's made to cut her relatives. <br /> <br /> The other characters look like they're only in series so Jim can have someone to get to him. If Cheryl's character was a real person, she would leave her years ago, and she would not stay with the corpse for 8 years. But unfortunately, she is just a catalyst for Jim's unpredictable extreme middle-class sobriety.
