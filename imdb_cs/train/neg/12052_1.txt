What happens if you give the free man enough money to capture him in a rat race and look at him? Homeless do not answer to anyone. They have no mortgages, rent payments, or idiotic bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about IRS ratings, performance ratings, or credit card payments. But give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to take care of entering a diving plant, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance for their car and working for someone else. They have a chance to be "productive citizens". This movie was about as useful as a movie. It's a way to say rich and middle class "will you see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and this confirms capitalist arrogance. Why not a movie that asks, "What happens if you take away everything a rich man has?"
