This is probably the worst excuse for TV programming because, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT COST NOW? Nothing has ever happened in this ridiculous "series". Although it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin by yourself, you do not get any good details into their personal life. Usually it's just making stupid, jittery little talk and acting like white baskets. Look, I love Britney's music just like another girl, but this show is just a clean filler for a nation so dependent on Britney to watch her nail clip (yes, that might be a real episode). Thanks to God, the two of them broke up because they were PRINCE dull together. This show is TOXIC!
