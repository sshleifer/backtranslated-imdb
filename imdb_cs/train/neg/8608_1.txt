This film contains two of my favorite actors in Kilmere and Downey. It also boasts pleasing Larry Miller in a small part. Despite that, I found it almost inconsistent. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty, but she's almost helpless, and why Downey's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the movie presents or the way it is portrayed. Termination seems challenging, and although the intention seems to be that the audience has to join the nod and wink of the film because it has not been able to pass on to its protagonists, it leaves us reluctant or incapable of doing so. <br /> </ p> <p> Fans of the film say that those who disagree simply will not "get it." I do not think that's true. The plot was not complicated or incomprehensible. It was simply insignificant and clumsy and apparently made. Paddy Breathnach "I Went Down" and Guy Ritchie "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" are much better examples of such a film that director Shane Black will not achieve. > <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but the view of his credits (mostly as a screenwriter) makes me separate from any other connection.
