This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they forgot how to act. I was hoping the movie would be better when it went on, but the acting was so robotic that it had been condemned from the very beginning. It seemed that some actors could read the script all the time. Perhaps it was a musical score or a director himself, but one thing is certain that make-up artist needs to get another job! The face powder was so powerful that you saw it on the faces of the actors! This film would not recommend anyone, no wonder they never get to the Theaters. Kuba Gooding Jr. James Woods ashamed you did not do it. The plot was great, but he needed much more.
