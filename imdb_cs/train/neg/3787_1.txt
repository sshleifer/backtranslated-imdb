I have to be one person in America who did not like this movie. I guess it was just not my style or something, I just do not see what is so fascinating, it was hardly fun, let alone one of the greatest successes in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a man who has come to nothing and becomes a drug lord. A fairly simple way to describe the whole movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because the film is about mafias / drug stores / criminal groups does not automatically mean it's a great movie, do not forget good stories.
