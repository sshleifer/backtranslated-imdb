My wife and I really had hope for this movie, but it was a great disappointment. It was native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails in everything he is trying to do, like fishing, hunting, obviously exposes his family to wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in this process indifferent to his son numerous times of various obvious things. Words can not say how bad this movie is. Children and wife are very real, making the film even more sad. I do not understand humor ... if you do not like laughing when other people are crazy. I do not understand how it could come to the awards. Save your money, not rent.
