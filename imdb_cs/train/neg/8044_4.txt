Well, I was looking at this film more than two years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to look at it again and I must say that I actually think this movie is good. This movie captured the buzz as a bootleg I know what you did in the summer of 3, like the Final Stab was Scream 4, and this movie is not that bad. I think it had mistakes and of course it would be ridiculous to release it in theaters, but for the midnight popcorn movie, this film is not half bad. She has some fears and some really hot women I could add. Moreover, it shows that Joey Lawrence is a new muscular appearance, although of course not even playing any big Hollywood role, or ... I feel bad about that man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's Flower, some Disney movies and the eternal brothers of Lawrence ... Joey Lawrence was a bit of a sitcom scene player, but then as in a 360 degree step, his career went south to just making low-budget movies like this one. <br /> <br /> The film also discourages you from thinking between the crew, there is really a secret that somebody knows, only to be eventually disappointed to find out the secret. He also throws you off on who's a murderer, I've had some idea, but still I do not think he's a killer who he was, but his motives related to the mystery were a great decay. Now was the secret that was released? This movie could be one of the best movies. But I'm also a fool for college and I also went to college for a spring break in a big beach house house, similar to this one, so I just felt sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> so-so slash flick. Good for a midnight movie.
