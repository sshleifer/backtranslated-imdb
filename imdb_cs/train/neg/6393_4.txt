I admit that I did not give this film much chance. I decided pretty soon that it was just not my film. <br /> <br /> In most cases, he has an excellent view of his cinematography. Scenes from the early 1970s Manhattan look very good, just like the main actress. It is very sharp black and white, which could almost cause the film to feel undated and fresh. Some of the other techniques employed by filmmakers shoot that they look to hell. Unrelated editing is very late in the 1960s, somewhere between surrealism and a new wave. The story also seems to have come from a very specific time, somewhere between the ideal of free love and artistic experimentation. The film follows a young girl in the neighborhood of the city when looking for a man who had an anonymous phone sex with. When he encounters other special characters, he reveals his grief and reveals them. It looks like the movie looks like a comedic story outside the wall, but it brings an avant-garde feeling. I'd like to expect that if you like Andy Warhol's movies, you'll be thrilled to find the phone book. I had some problems: Near the end of the movie, one character tells of a restless anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes? There is also a very explicit animation sequence that I found to be rough and juvenile, which serves as the culmination of the film. I heard loudly four or five times, and I liked the end (except for a totally disgusting animation). And when the movie changed to the color for the last sequence of the phone booth-in-night, I really liked what it looked like better. It ended up as one of those experiences when I felt like I really liked it if it was a bit different. But this is what our filmmakers gave us. It's blackout, art, and the way to the left of the dial, but none of them is a reason to recommend it yourself. I did not find it unique or creative, forced and demanding.
