This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever did. This is a typical 80th film where you have one man to destroy the entire army itself. "The First Blood 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando," but there you have Arnold to kill a terrorist while you have a specific nation that has turned out to be bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It is true that it was the height of the Cold War, but I feel that Communists or Nazis are always shown as enemies. There are so many American films that have this thing in common. Why can not a movie show Americans as an enemy? Who thinks that a solitary soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think something like that really happened? Looking at it, the average American spectator who brainwashed surely would have done it.
