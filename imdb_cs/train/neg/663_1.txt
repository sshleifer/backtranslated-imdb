Imagine a screenplay - you're in the cinema just because you're in a Washington weekend and it's raining and ending up with the museums. Do you think you could visit the movie Sarah Marshall because it looks like a trailer and you do not have to get involved in the brain. It's sold out. Options? - Job Bank, Bruges, Leatherheads or Prom Night. You saw the Job Bank (surprisingly nice heist film it) and in Bruges (again quite good), so you're two. You do not have the desire to watch Clooney or a pretty office outfit in 1930 football uniforms, so do you look at Prom Night? Poorly. You take $ 8.50, go to the street for a stranger and ask him to hit you in the face for $ 8.50. The money would be better spent. In fact, it's more like a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it is. If I funded the film and showed me that as a final cut I would not know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. Insulting on someone's intelligence ... my roommate laughed laughingly about most of the film in terms of acting, could also break robots (or perhaps dogs) in roles, they would be more realistic. Detective must be perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan) (I hate his acting so much that I do not care how you say his name) that you're lightened on your title. > <br /> So in summary 'not good'
