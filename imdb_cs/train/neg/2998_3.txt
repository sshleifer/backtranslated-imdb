Just for Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she makes a number with older cleaning ladies (you've all seen the photos) and a very good number at the very end. There are several scenes where the lines are fun. But basically the script is so bad, and the movie is so heavy that there is no fear of the world. But it is worth 2.50 to borrow the film - just get him ready for a fast handover.
