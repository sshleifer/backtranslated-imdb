</ P> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The new Disney movie, Inspector Gadget, is about a policeman named John who survives a major accident and is rescued by the most advanced experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine as an agent that has tools and clippings of all kinds built into his body when using it when he says "Go Go", just called Inspector Gadget! The film's own structure is very similar to the body of Inspector Gadget itself. It's noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a pile of half-cuts that fit together to create something that has nothing to do with anything else. The film is basically a series of moody action sequences that are generically associated with characters and an uneven story that will only appeal to children aged 6-9. The policeman who is dramatically developed is played by Matthew Broderick, who, as long as the Inspector Gadget, has been on a successful spree with films like "Election". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after encountering a film of a heavily rogue villain named Claw. Rupert Everett starred in this year's disaster with the terrifying "William Shakespeare's Dream of the Holy Night". In this movie is a romantic subplot, as well as lots of scenes involving Inspector Gadget has annoying body parts and mechanism. It has Gadget and Claw that surprised the attractive character of Brenda played by Joely Fisher, both for her appearance and her knowledge of the particular invention of her late father, who had previously killed Claw. Competition is evolving into combat scenes and is the cause of many events in the movie. Also the main character is Mobil Gadget, life as a car that was designed for the Inspector Gadget itself. This is expressed by D.L. Hughly from the comedy "The Hughly's". "Inspector Gadget" is a movie I found very badly. I know, I'm not exactly the target audience of the creators, but even the ten-year-old relative found the movie he did not like. The film is full of obvious shortcomings and obvious problems. I have never found myself staring at the characters. There is no mood swing under some neat start credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film "Mr. Magoo" that opened with the clips of the original cartoon series. It's too much to ask for the same type of thing in this comedy - which is rarely fun and somewhat convincing. The overall production design is nothing more than a clutter of incomplete visual gags and consists of one joke: Inspector Gadget is a stinker. In films like this audience desires the border - something that helps find out what can happen and can not. There are no such limits in the "Gadget Inspector". This is no more than a party for actors who have had lots of fun. I remember another missing comedy, which was launched a few years ago, called "Blankman," which once again contained plenty of props and energies, and the actors certainly enjoyed the time with all the gizmos and props but also lacked something needed for each movie: Audience Participation. <br /> <br /> The character I discovered was a lot omitted is the daughter of Gadgets, who still does not know what her name is until the end of the movie. It is used only as a tool - and I ask how she was accustomed to being related. Because its presence does not bring the film any significant or productive effect. We never know her reaction to her father's operation or accident. So it is someone who could be completely omitted and should not have a little influence on the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible, inadequate excuse for a child's comedy. Believe it or not, I found out that I was comparing this film with a violent and very young audience to "Blade" in recent years. I say again that I rather had a movie in which nothing will happen until everything happens. "The Inspector Gadget," so much spent on it at the same time, it literally caused me dizziness. <br /> <br />
