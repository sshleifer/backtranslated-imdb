This movie shows a series of sketches that partly pass into each other. I realized that I was late in the movie, it just irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to awaken this fact with absurdity and obscenity. An attempt to remain comedy without some funny bits will fail. My staff and perhaps a subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts in my head every time I call it "film"): A courageous attempt not to change anything into something great. But it failed. At least the director did not do anything about it. But it's not good. Many movies did not look as fun as planned, but that's all. It is a real life example of the worst film scenario. No. To fix oneself is even worse. A film with gags so bad that they are not funny at all. It's no fun to see how the lead actor, writer and director (all three same guy by the way) die by drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The film is bad for that.
