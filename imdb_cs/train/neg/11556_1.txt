These Italians! Assuming films about aristocrats with special fetishes, castles drowned in the Gothic atmosphere and relatives trying to get their inheritance in their hands are all extremely interesting for everyone! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've basically seen them all (the popular MST3K "Screaming Skull" fits into the mold) ... and "The Night Evelyn came out of the grave" -the-numbers, and boring as hell. Even the delicious Erika Blanc is destroyed here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
