The moment you make an "artistic film" 1/10, you have people who are worried about their unconscious, half-obedient, artistic retarded blood. I will not try to justify that I am not an aesthetically challenged retarder by listing all the "art cinema" I liked, or I mentioned how I gave an unknown "classical classic" for 10/10. All I ask is someone to explain to me the purpose and the message of this film. Here is how I would summarize the film: Opening the assembly of three unrelated urban legends that show a near absurd level of co-incidence. This follows (in a nutshell to save you three hours of pain) the following: - A play for children who is dying of lung cancer, trying to patch with his coca-dependent daughter, who may or may not rape when he was a child and who is polite a policeman with relationship problems while the star racer of the game decides he does not want to be the child's unlucky miracle, which is the fate that has come to the next game contestants of the 1960s who we see is now homosexual unemployed in love with a bartender with barrels and needs money for "correcting oral surgery," while the producer of a game that dies itself of lung cancer asks his sister to help himself leave the son he left years ago and who subsequently became a female suicidal guru, even when the other the wife of the Producer suffers from a blame for blaming a dying man; and oh, eventually the jars are raining (you read right). And I will save you incredibly long and useless, literally restless monologues, as it seems that each character comes without any rhyme or reason than to make sure the movie exceeds 3 hours and will be classified as "modern epic". <br /> <br /> You probably think I could have done a better job of summarizing the film (and conversely, not confusing you) if I wrote something damn a little more coherent, perhaps in several sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
