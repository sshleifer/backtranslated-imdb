It's really sad that it was the highest budget with which Halestorm Entertainment had to work. All participants should be fined for garbage because all the celluloses that are unnecessarily good only for refuse. Not only is writing horrible and jokes terrible, but working with camera and film quality are amateur at best. Soundtrack sounds like it was created on a laptop. The worst thing is that I actually sat the whole thing. I think it was just because I could not believe I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching really did agree with showing the film.
