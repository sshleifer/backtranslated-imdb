I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the towns looked terrible. Also the crowd figures looked too weird. Warren Beatty did not do a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but it was not one of his better performances. Madonna should just keep singing. Glenne Headly took good care of this film. I got this movie 2/10 just for the amazing performance of Al Pacino. In his career, it was not a top note, but she worked well.
