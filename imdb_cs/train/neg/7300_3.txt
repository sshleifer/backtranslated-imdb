This movie is about a group of five friends who rented a chat in the woods. One of your friends catches a scary viral virus. Suddenly, friends turn each other in a desperate attempt to prevent the disease from harming itself. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a terrible movie. For one, a lot of genres are trying to be at once. Does it have to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? No one can say. There is a serious scene for the first and the second change, it changes into fun. When the movie tries to be humorous, humor is totally insignificant, except for the end. I liked it very much. But besides the end I was quite disappointed and disgusted. Violence is violently recognizable, looking more away from the screen than afraid. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see the girl who makes karate in the union. What are we supposed to get? The same girl would bite one of the characters. Should it be funny? I do not know. Some performances were decent, and many were quite amateur. I did not care for most of the characters. I liked the conspiracy, but the execution was scary. As a horror film I did not know what it was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense or spooky. Finally, you remain indifferent and think, "What have I just experienced?" Unfortunately, you never know the answer to this question.
