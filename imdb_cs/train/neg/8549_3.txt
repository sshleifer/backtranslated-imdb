Okay, what the hell did I watch a bit now? "The Witch Mountain must be one of the most incoherent and mad Spanish exploits, while it is strangely persuasive too. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here, and I even doubt it sometimes worked with a script but somehow I could not shut it down. Head scratching begins with confusion, with an introductory sequence of an angry little girl who killed a cat's mother, so do you think this movie is revolving around kids possessed by evil forces? Damn it, because after this introduction the girl and her anger simply do not. Then cut yourself to the guy with the most impressively chopped mustache you've ever seen, and who's falling apart with his girlfriend somewhat awkward, and when he asks her to spend her vacation, he immediately calls his employer to ask for any kind of assignment! The film finally begins now as it travels to an isolated mountain area and shoots n which peaks. Though before he took the new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographed her top! Along the way they appear all the strange events? you guessed it? are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the woods, there is loud music of petrifying music, and even someone steals the jeep! Really, witch? The clay of silent sorcerers seems to possess mountains and practice voodoo for misdemeanors. It's as close as describing the plot, but is there a big chance I'm gone? The atmosphere is more important! The "Witch Mountain" is sometimes very scary, with its scary music and interesting cinematography. Supported characters look unusual and sweet Patty Shepard plays a good hero. This is a type of European horror film that could have been legendary if anyone bothered to write a structured script.
