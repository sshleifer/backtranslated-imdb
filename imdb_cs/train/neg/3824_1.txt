I feel the movie did not show Smith historically. The aim of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" to the people of the LDS Church, it seemed that historical accuracy was a bit worried. The film was designed to be a "supportive faith" experience, not a balanced view of Smith "as a man". I took it on myself to study the life of Smith and read how the LDS works, so even no LDS works. The film, like most of the LDS projects, was beautifully shot and performed well. However, it was not a realistic picture of the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. Considerable time was given to resume the accident Smith had when he had seven. While this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental outlook, it seems that the main reason why the film is included is to help create a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is a portrait of Smith's teen years, when the film is silent about the involvement of the Smith family in magical practices in 1820. Another problem is when the film shows that Joseph Smith adventurously enters matches, can not show how he has lost his mood sometimes and has become violent. I could go on and on. This film was not a historical one and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I do not want to recommend seeing this movie for any purpose other than fun.
