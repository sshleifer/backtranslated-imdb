This movie is the biggest heap of cooking, you know what, Being from and growing up in Wichita in Kansas, I know that 90% of the movie is Bogus. In addition to the names of some victims, nothing was right. The film looks like it was made with a tattooed smart camera. She had shots that, in my opinion, came from another movie along with the record of the slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent files, and a very boring and short end. It was a struggle to keep track of it until the end. I recommend that you do not waste money on this movie, or you will regret it. Crunch
