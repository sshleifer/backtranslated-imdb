This movie is terrible. The story concerns a woman who is trying to figure out what happened to her sister. The film fights its identity, flowing from Noir / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown in good measure. The film has a very confused structure, for example, with the frequent use of flashbacks without putting them into the story. The conspiracy is poorly developed and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish who was and who played. Some ambiguities exist in many films, but the scene where the protagonist voluntarily accompanies a virtual stranger to his home then agrees to go up to himself alone (where he says he finds the phone), except for the weapon he brought with her , to call the police, it was too hard to believe. Some of the cinematography is very bad: we watched on a 42 "TV, so as if someone with a smaller set could solve what's happening in scenes made in almost complete darkness is behind me, it's a messy mess.
