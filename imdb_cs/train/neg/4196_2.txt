This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not just a story, but acting is shocking. Dialog sounds like someone who reads the message. <br /> <br /> This is classified as comedy / drama / romance, it's not one of those things! It's a small action, that's it. In fact, there is no comedy and drama. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see it, I'm sorry. I would not recommend it at all. Anything else you choose to look for will be better. This is almost an action / crime movie. The action scenes have sprung up and part of the crime was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to look at a "foreign" movie for the challenge of being alien. Then it could be for you.
