Some very interesting camera work and a story with great potential. But he never meets anything other than a student's diploma thesis at a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons. Fist, there is not one fairy tale or a villain that we could admire for his chuck. Second, all the actresses are horrible - even from veteran Willem Dafoe. The ham is so abundant here, you feel like a picnic - but one of those poor company picnic staff, where you drink too much cheap beer and you get a hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat the ugly hot horse and throw it away. Okay, I'm a young director a little harsh, who could still go to places - as I said, working with the camera is pretty good. </ br /> <br /> But I feel cheating - the blur for this movie suggests that we get a look at 'Modern Western', and the DVD wrapper has pictures of what they are suggesting - but no one actually attached to the movie is it seems that this is the kind of movie they should do. <br /> <br /> Such betrayal is what hurts; but without it, it remains the fact that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confused and we just do not care for it recently. <br /> <br /> I left the DVD player for about half way. but the rental would not give me the money back. <br /> <br /> Now it really hurts.
