Did I see a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: Hands of Destiny" pulled more than "Dukes". I had a lot of fun when I touched a giant conspiracy before making the film at all times. Let's touch a few ... <br /> <br /> There was a striking scripture death and rebirth when Sheev talked to the Duchesses and did not respond. He shrugged and moved, for neither Knoxville nor Scott knew what he was talking about (not us). It was as if the engine had died and was restarted. Several times General Lee flew through the air was not even exciting. Nothing I've seen on TV shows. Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was disturbed by Luke for stealing him. The only reason why this works is that the script actually caught it (though roughly). The rest of the time seems to be distant and forced. Seann William Scott is a terrible, scary accent (or his lack). I hated Willie Nelson. Were the bad jokes? I wanted him to disappear. Jessica Simpson is great on big screen. Actually she felt like one of the better actors in the movie. It tells you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. During the climax of the film, I rooted Boss Hogga and the bad guys to make the entire Hazzard district, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would suffice. This is not meant as a continuous dismantling of the film, but the release of frustration in the unfortunate writing and execution of what could really be a heart-breaking movie. br /> <br /> If we could erase and start again ...
