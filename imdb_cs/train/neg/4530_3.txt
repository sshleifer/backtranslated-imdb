SPLIT SECOND can be a good movie. The story of the murder of "road anger" has a very young Clive Owen, who gives quite good performance; ALE ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers undermine their own film with an idiot camera and really horrible editing. The camera jumps all over the creature in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress from business, family and traffic. What he does is give the audience the headache. Because the filmmakers were not interested in making a good film, but only to take their idiot photos to each other, you should not waste time on this travesty.
