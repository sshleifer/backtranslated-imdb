My seven-year-old daughter loved it because Disney's screaming failed to count it. This is a problem with "Air Buddies". These are children's movies from the very beginning, filled with carefully counted cuteness, two politically correct morals, and enough humor to avoid the dreaded evaluation of G. As a parent or even a 10-year-old you have seen it before and before. Think about "101 Dalmatians meeting home alone" and get a general idea. I am of the opinion that the story of good children is a good story, a period. Air Buddies, which is about as original as recycled paper, does not meet this standard. This is not the worst video your child could watch, but the megatons are better.
