Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and moderator. In the early 1990s, he tried movies as well. But this incredible piece of unsolicited music has ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a soccer woman television presenter and program maker. Actually, I saw it in (almost empty) theater because I was a fan of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I'm sorry I spent money on her. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story, and it's done in all possible ways. Some people think it's so bad that it's funny. I'm not one of them. I have just discovered that it is an incredible waste of time and money.
