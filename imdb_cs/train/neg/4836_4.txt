Let's start with simple lines. From the spectator's point of view, there are a few good "directorial details", some views of the movie scenes that are pretty. Special effects are good enough, good work / good scenery also. But the story is too simple. It shows how an elite army bomb unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. Displays the course of life in the war. In my film experience as a serious action movie, "addicted" guy, I missed the click that my eyes and thought stuck on the screen. One of the things that must be present in the movie to consider it good is the ability to immerse the viewer into film reality and time. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious" for the whole movie. To be honest, I think that this film has gained its place in glory based on the "subconscious" challenge of American patriotism, a healthy and real feeling but not an adequate use as a film fanatic. More than a movie about the war, on the basis of it increases its popularity. Simple idea: If it were a war in the Second World War or World War II, would change only the change of time and everything remained the same, be granted? Certainly not. Why? Since there are great ones that promote the bar to high. <br /> <br /> Unlike my Oscar competitors, I do not think all the prizes won are properly awarded.
