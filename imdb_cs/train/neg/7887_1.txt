... then they will have the right place to hand these bulls. We apologize, not the "secret," as he claims to be a religious mumbo-jumbo. I was still waiting for the "unimaginable evil" I was promised, but "evil" in this view would be unimaginable to a five-year-old man with learning disabilities. I can not believe that it was really possible to find a bigger name for actors who want to get involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it has always changed my mind about them and I probably avoid what they are doing in the future. I have also told a bit that now I have the name of the writer and the director's name that I remember because I am avoiding what they are doing as a plague from now on. It's really unfortunate that all religious fanatics broadcast here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. They will have their reviews published first. This could lead to more people getting scammed, as if it were, to believe that this film is anything other than a religious sermon. Well, it's in the video store to get my money back for a fake ad. It's a shame I can not go back 105 minutes, which I was watching unnecessarily when I thought it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
