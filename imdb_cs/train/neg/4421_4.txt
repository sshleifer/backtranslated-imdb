The subject is certainly convincing: a group of people is tempted to play one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes, and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that interferes with our collective need to "escape" from reality and sometimes the gladness of our existence - something almost everyone can relate to. Characters are a predictable combination of Lord of the Rings enthusiasts and Star Trek enthusiasts. It's enough for most people to watch. The film, however, quickly becomes an obvious look at wargaming with an almost stereotyped touch of nose to viewers who "do not understand". It seems that the filmmakers are interested in fighting games and this particular, seriously, more seriously than once, when they recognize the humor and fun of filming an adult film that rises in medieval equipment and bursts with foam swords. It is quite difficult for anyone sitting on their computer for 7-10 hours a day to play games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care. It seems, however, that the filmmakers themselves are not interested in choosing to concentrate exclusively on the theme of the game itself, rather than on building a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone can understand. The characters themselves are not so convincing, and you get bored quickly: a great deal if you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
