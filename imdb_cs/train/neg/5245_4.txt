I am a contemporary A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in the classroom, and what I got out of was a clear bias in the movie. The film seems to be inclined toward P.O.V. from a "common deafening perception" is not their center. The film also did not mention or take into account other situations discussed in this issue. I.E. Deaf people who were born and later deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? The film is biased and practically everything is in the opinion of the deaf with the capital "D". Not that it was bad, but to be a real documentary, he should try to be slightly impartial.
