This version of "Moby Dick" offends the audience by claiming it is based on Melville's novel - even going so far as to show the false sentence of the first chapter rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael." In addition to being horrific, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go about revisiting and changing the famous novel just to improve his chances at the box office. romantic, beautiful poetic language was completely erased, and Ahab was changed from a crazy, blasphemous, obsessed, crazy crazy hero who just wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance turns away when he sees his wooden leg. To this is added a standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself, and another end!
