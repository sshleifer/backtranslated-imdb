A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what the foxes do. that it is stealing from the holding and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide to have this fox enough and try different ways to solve the problem. They are of course "out ripping" at every turn and while the trio are camped in a fox holes family perform raids against three farmers land. The "movie" version, and I use the long movie very loosely, is more of a god a terrible passion for American heist films, especially ocean films. They even have George Clooney like a fox man to join the insult and managed to completely omit the story. So, let them go. They make a lot of money and destroy another classic children's book Roald Dahl.
