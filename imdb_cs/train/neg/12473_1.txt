This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything is weak and disjointed. Acting is absurd, costumes even frantic and the story does not exist. This "Sword of Poverty" and adventure film was meant to capture some of the successes that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed, but it gives us no reason to follow. The nature of the lead is dense and dull, it can not even fight the sword and the sword is from the 16th century. All action sequences are so slow and unreal, not to mention castles and horribly dated musical music whenever horse rides. Do not bother with this bullshit.
