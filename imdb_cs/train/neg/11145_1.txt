Where to start? . . . I feel ... broken! That's right, broken! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours, that I could spend something more important, like watching dry colors, so-called horrors. no dramatic, there is no action, there is nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, boring, tragic ... <br /> <br /> I could be a little rough but watch this movie and you feel the same way ... or ... no, do not look at it ... if you do not feel like it too.
