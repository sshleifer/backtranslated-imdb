The last few weeks in the life of a dead fat woman are said in retrospectives. Like a rookie, the film shoots aimlessly and rather unnecessarily. Mona, a lazy, sorry and drug-dependent title, is not sympathetic and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. Although there is some demanding dialogue that tries to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motivation is never quite clear. The episodic nature of the movie, including some random characters, becomes tedious after a while, so it seems to be much longer than running. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not attract more attention from men.
