Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had a tense font, a great look, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, hot men and women were running in uniform and out. <br /> <br /> Only lazy. Lazy writing. Actors smoke the storm to give them a "character". Rural sequences that destroy the feeling they are somewhere else (yes, it is the Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot and lots of teenage anxiety. LOTY gyrating naked women (but in the background, which I'm sure will be lowered for the series) and a token look of some men in towels. None of the actors, except Polly Walker, ever paid attention to me. In an hour and a half I still wondered when it would end. So what exactly is to bring me back? Science fiction? It's terribly light. Actors? Besides, Polly Walker is fine, it's not very interesting. There are no "hotties" in the cast, except for Esai, although for the younger set it is old because it is over 25 years old. I enjoyed BSG. I was skeptical when I heard of Caprici, and unfortunately I think I'm right. I predict this very short run for it as a series if they really sharpen their pencils over at SciFi and get to work doing it more than an OC on another planet.
