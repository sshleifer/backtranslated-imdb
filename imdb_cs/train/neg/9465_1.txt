From acting, direction, screenwriting, and artistic direction, this film is simply totally ill-conceived, and the money would be better spent on land mines shoes. When did we get so sad that they had to fill a child's movie with sexual cues to give their parents attention. Doctor Suess is now piling up in a tomb with "dirty" SHIT and false erection scenes and so on. It's shameful how they trade Suess to bring their children to their parents, get dirty trying to teach and a few sad parents who will not watch the movie with their child if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare it to classic children's films and we can get a disturbing look at the world is changing. These guys should hold MTV videos. How did this film get> 400 votes, because the perfect 10 is behind me. (if his family of directors)
