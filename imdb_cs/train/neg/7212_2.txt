Why every horror director wants to emulate "The Exorcist" is a complete puzzle for me because the "classic" of William Friedkin is a very overrated movie and in my opinion it's not all tense or shocking. Still, there is another pure renunciation, this time Spanish, which is reminiscent of the story of a young girl who gets obsessed with pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who must admit he looks quite hot here) plays a honorary priest who approached John Gibson because his sister Leila has changed drastically since meeting with her new friend. First, the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with his neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more pronounced ... "Exorcism" is not only very non-original, it's also an unbearably boring movie! Here Naschma and director Juan Bosch have had an open opportunity to perform a religiously motivated explosion, full of shock and bleeding, yet it is the result of a tame and generally bloodless drama that will almost succumb to you! The last twenty minutes contains some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there are lots of stylishly filmed women naked and dirty. The absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse since Paul Naschy had previously shown himself to have enough imagination to make up for a lack of money. It's just a horrible movie, the end of the story. Other European "outrages" are "Antichrist" and "Behind the door" and also hers!
