I've seen a better production quality on YouTube! I liked the actors because the writing was horrible and shocking, I do not know how they could get the lines out - I really doubt that every actor would be able to save this movie no matter how good they are. The characters did not develop at all, and there was no real coherence in the conspiracy that was far from being lost anywhere. It's really a shame because the premise of the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could be a decent movie. It was definitely not a comedy unless you laugh laughing - it was amateur, even the English actors were strange.
