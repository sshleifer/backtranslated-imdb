this movie is in the style of MANDINGO & DRUM <br /> <br /> they were both terrible, but they are 100% better than this shit <br /> <br /> Badly acting and doing Oliver Reed's main name & Eartha Kitt is also in it. It's a shame. The rating is 1/2 * about as low as you can get <br /> <br /> as always jay harris
