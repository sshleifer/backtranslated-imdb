I bought the movie for $ 5 in a video store at my local video store just for Chase Masterson, but I had to tear five, toss him to the toilet and pay. The film is about a group of twenty somethings that culminated in high school and reunited on the anniversary of the death of their idiots who were drunk, wandering into the woods and dying. There is a problem is the reptilian monster is chasing them down one by one. It is a horror, these worthless people were apparently postponed at exhibitions such as 90210 and Dawsons Creek. Direction was at the age of twelve, and the scenario was probably done by thirteen. The whole set looks like a small courtyard in Malibu. The people who praised this film are apparently friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this waste pile at ALL cost.
