This is a breakthrough movie. <br /> <br /> Beauty in sexual relations between men and women is demonstrably degraded by a group of men and women, which can only be described as a collection of special problems. <br /> <br /> Greenaway recognizes his inspiration for Fellini's "8 1/2", but while Fellini is the titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. It has no light touch to the master or his ability to convey feelings and emotions with clarity of clarity. It is very demanding, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to everyone, as if the viewer had to be led into the film except that the written announcement would remain on the screen for a few seconds that are not long enough to read the audience, mostly ignored. As for women, only two may be described as seeking, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest with ordinary. Both women and men retreat from the harsh light of reality into dark shades of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway seems to want to emphasize that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are depressing because they provide their services in exchange for money. Relationships between men and women are impaired in a business transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of joy, happiness or love in the movie, there are a few scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The proposal for an incestuous relationship between father and son Philip and Storey Emmental played John Stojící and Matthew Delamere. Mighty ignorance of the two men that Giaconda bears with her child actually gets pregnant twice, the first fetus is interrupted, and the second is sent to the destination the men have chosen from the flight. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs (half the woman in the name). Beastiality, which exists between Beryl, was played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortens. Father and son share women among them. Women enjoy being defeated sexually. My father sleeps with the dead body of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Mercifully, none of these scenes are shown sexually, it just suggests. <br /> <br /> The alleged degradation of women is such that we can not be surprised that the film was nasty when it was screened for the first time in Cannes. Even more exceptional is that the actresses in the film dressed to defend her, again show that the naivety of women is not limited and that women will be crazy to be exploited by men. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's directorial style is demanding, it is a triumph in the style of the essence, the depiction of the film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. Greenaway tries to achieve the sublimity of surrealism, but only successfully shows the banality of human relationships.
