The Missing American family, on the West Coast, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. He rarely knows that this ghost town was once a test site for a nuclear bomb, and their lethal presence is haunting them. Generally, I love such mysterious-horror films. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "Birds" are all great examples of movies that give no answers, but they let us take a look and want more. The writer / director "Disappearance" Walter Klenhard seems to be trying to shoot the kind of film and if he succeeds, it is the viewer. I personally think he got there about half way, then the film just sank. Actors are all just "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad, but we, as viewers, never feel their fear and react to the situation in an unrealistic way. Is someone else absolutely wrong of the characters just going away to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them some justification! As for television films, it's definitely a supernatural fair. Director Klenhard should be praised for having really deserted the environment for everything he offered, and some of the settings were striking. There's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test area because the sand was completely melted on the glass as far as it could see. I wonder if it was real? <br /> <br /> No gore of which he speaks, and the "creature" or what the hell is that after these people? we never even gave a real idea of ​​what they are (Mutants, aliens, ghosts, or ancient evil Indian souls - that really reduces it for us!) or where they come from. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of cliches here. Why are people of these types of movies always really, really stupid? Why is he always an old man that everyone thinks he's crazy about to prove he's right? Why? Why? Why? How about the new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" is trying to be different and intelligent, but ultimately fails by being in many respects too familiar to horror fellow fans right into the video. Hey, I've seen a lot worse movies and disappearance is not bad, is it just too much? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
