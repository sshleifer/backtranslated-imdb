Hi there, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, even though I've been using it as a link for some time now. I would therefore like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will undoubtedly influence my judgment. I hope I will not bother. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (all of us Greeks really), analyzing Omirus's epic (and not the Homery as you see everywhere), rhyming with rhymes. If I remember well, it was Iliad (8th class) and Odyssey (Odyssey) of the 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a great disappointment for me and my colleagues in Greece around the campus (I'm studying in the UK). Iliad epic is one of the best literary works ever heard. It was composed by the Greek poet Omirus for 400 years after the actual war. Historians gave the Trojan War around 1200 BC and the real reason for the war was not Helen's beauty, but the strategic position of Troy. It says now that it can be understood that the Omirus epic does not provide real events (because it is not historically accurate), but that was never the goal of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this huge poem, one can be interested in the definition of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The most important and most educational were the long conversations between the warriors before the battle. None of this was revealed in Troy <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap for my eyes, and other intellectuals also my English from Finnish and German colleagues. It is a pity to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid argument (computer graphics did all the work) and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best job. <br /> <br /> Lastly, I say you'd better watch something else. I'm giving Troy 2 of 10. It's a really expensive movie B. <br /> <br /> Hi <br /> <br /> Alex
