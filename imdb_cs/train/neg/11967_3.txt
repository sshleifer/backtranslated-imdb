Given the risk of same-sex relationships by the end of the 1980s, Personal Best would be better able to play the same sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as more than the experimental phase of Cahill's life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have cast the same relationship between two fairly attractive women to attract the audience. Consider also 90 seconds of revealing the crotch of a few women jumping backwards over a high jump. This random scene was of great importance to the film, and it seemed as if it were only to make the audience interested in this harsh film. I suppose the producers tried to deal with the boring conspiracy and the more boring setting of the movie (1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition). This review may seem harsh, but it is true. The use of the young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same sex relationship destroyed any credit I would give to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
