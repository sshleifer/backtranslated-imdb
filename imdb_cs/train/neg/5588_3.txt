This is an attempt by both Edgar Rice Burroughs and the filmmakers of the Arabian "Tarzan of the Apes". But this desert film does not show anything of the majesty present in the more successful jungle of the adventures of Burroughs. Emphasis is placed on love between the handsome English nobleman Jon Hall (like "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as "the Princess" Eulilah), with vengeance that coincides with their desire to merge. In the introduction, it is stated that although the mother is mother-in-law, she is not guilty, but she never returns to the picture again. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has worsened and seems to be missing. <br /> <br /> Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
