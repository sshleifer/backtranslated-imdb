Where do you even start? Wonderful acting? Nonsense plot? Exceptional basement effects? Totally nasty characters? Edit the burst? Casual Scalp Scoring Headaches ??? I'm a lifetime horror fan and I have no problem at all with the current "torture" -Ton "movie trend. But this is a badly made piece of rubbish I think I have suffered more pain watching this than the characters die in it! If you like girls are forced to eat mixed-fried cock, really poor soft kernel porn and I think the lines like "I find that b **** and Screw it c *** Closed! "are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. As for me, I feel the need to go rinse my eyes with the oven cleaner to avoid seeing this movie again!
