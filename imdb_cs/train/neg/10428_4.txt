Did anyone else feel betrayed like me? The first hour or so was pretty solid, but the last one. Oh my god. It seemed predictable and cheesy. It was not grandiose and epic, like the whole show. Most reviews have been read, but I really do not understand why. I was really predicting that the general had finished WAY before, but then he pulled it off because I thought "No, they would never do that, it's too uncomfortable." I can barely stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm going out of the door to sell every season I own. Someone please. Change your mind. I want to love it. So bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. The horrible end.
