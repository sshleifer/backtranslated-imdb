I tried to watch this so-called Comedy, but it's hard to carry it. This is a bad, anxious, clich√©-free movie. Definitely not funny, but really boring and annoying. Bad script, bad behavior. It's a complete waste of time - and there's nothing more left to worry about. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
