When you see Boris Karloff and Belo Lugosi as stars, you expect to find a well-shot horror film, but it was completely different, representing what I would describe as an early science fiction effort. Karloff and Lugosi play scientists (Rukh and Benet) - competitors so long as Rukh did not win Benet with a demonstration demonstrating his great theory. Science here was - at least - a little rough around the edges (sci-fi, with an emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses some beam from Andromeda, which allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." In this historic time, an enormous meteorite has arrived in Africa, leaving the deposits of matter that scientists call "Radium X" - which can be cured and destroyed. A large part of the film is focused in Africa somewhat cautiously on the search for meteorite deposits that Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately he gets infected with some kind of disease that makes him a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both good. Lugosi pulls out the role of a good guy quite well, although I honestly found him to be a little unconvincing - especially in scenes in Africa. The story also aroused a bit, and while it kept me in mind, I was not missing it. Since this is really science fiction rather than horror and science fiction was in very early stages, I suppose the film must be a little relaxed. It was all right - nothing more, but nothing less. 4/10
