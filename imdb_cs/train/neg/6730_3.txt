It's a film about how men think women think of love. No woman describes a one-year sexual encounter and declares her as a love story. Of those ten monologues, I felt that only three really had some truth. I still waited for the movie to improve, and it was a bit, but it was never good enough. This is an interesting concept, and I still wanted it to be good, but it never did. Perhaps if they were actually love stories, it would work.
