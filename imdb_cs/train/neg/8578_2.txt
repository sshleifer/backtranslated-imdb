One of the strongest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable ghostly comedy with Kay Kyser. Kyer, the leader of the orchestra and the radio star (and the eternal brotherhood of the brotherhood), was a sort of predecessor of Spike Jones, who teased her for his guests and willingly supported his cheerful music band. He is hired for a birthday party in a gloomy castle garden, where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The girl is hit by a haunted judge, a terrifying professor, a sinister swami, a lot of ragged women, and pretty bad jokes that fill up three photographs of Bob Hope. Tracks (Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are unstoppable, and Kyser is not very convinced that he did this with elbow material, which changed in 1940 in ten years. * z ****
