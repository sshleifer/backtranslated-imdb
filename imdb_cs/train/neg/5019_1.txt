This movie was a waste of time, even by renting a DVD. If the super fast camera shots get faster than this, we could pay twenty dollars to get to the laundry, get the popcorn, and watch the dryer rotate. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope he will not make an early agreement to make other movies like "The One". <br /> <br /> If there is one movie you should avoid, it's "The One".
