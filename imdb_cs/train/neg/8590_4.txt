Happy. Angelika, the nine-year-old Annakina, turns into a kneeling 19-year-old Annakin, who seems to be appealing to Amidala, 5 years old. Now, the 22-year-old Jedi warrior, the hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, so he takes the children, his friends, and the whole frame of his existence, because the crazy old man has convinced him that a) his precious wife could really die, and b) Ludicrosity squared. I think people who like this movie do not pay attention. The story is ridiculous. Characters are incredible (literally no perverse sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-wan Kenobi was a wise and dear anchor for the whole series, but in the climax, he drops Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava bottle and let him suffer. Does not anyone think it's a bit out of nature? Not to mention that it was quite stupid to have a chance on it, as it turns out. I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent figures with credible motives. Nothing here. The story could have been written for ten years. <br /> <br /> Yeah, CGI is pretty cool.
