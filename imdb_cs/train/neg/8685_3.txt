Frankly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a small cartoon series with lots of fun (but revived and overturned) by Bush jokes. Apparently I should have reduced my expectations even more. Writing was totally pathetic. Besides Cheney-Chicken-Eating jokes and some catchy little stripes, it was really boring and unhappy. The animation was probably as sophisticated as the 13-year-old Flashu project. It is disgusting to use Macromedia for this product because it can do much more. Bush does not like it, and I like bush like another guy, but it was only a half-hour dressing for the president with a few painful moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done much more with being my Bush. Make your favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That's My Bush." Thank you.
