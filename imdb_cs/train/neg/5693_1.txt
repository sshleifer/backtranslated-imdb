I can not believe in positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, most badly performed and poorly-bred movies I've ever seen. And the plot was totally absurd (sp?). Does he work with him when he is tied up with a chair? puh-rental. The worst was the fact that it was not bad in good laughter. Simply horrible - I could not see why they even bothered to point it to HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid - very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit. idk, I could go on - I'm again shocked by positive reviews. The only thing that kept me in mind is that it's fascinating to see how the movie can go wrong and what it does wrong. And he did not fail in his stupidity! "to live by the sword, to die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
