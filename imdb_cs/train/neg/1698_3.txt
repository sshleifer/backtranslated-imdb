Lynch. The man has some really great things! He knows how to disturb us, then rewards us by thinking in different ways. However, this is completely different. Dumbland's reward is a 1% absurd comedy, obtained by a permanent stupidity of 99%. Maybe I laughed once, but somewhere around Episode 4 I just started to watch rapid progress. He did not leave me anything. I felt relaxed when it was over, and that is part of this series. It's an unpleasant series of unpleasant characters in annoying situations rounded off by annoying animation, voices and sound. But the recognition of this and its other absurd features still fails to make the Dumbland Prize.
