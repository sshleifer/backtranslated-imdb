This movie is so silly that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch "The Darkness Falls" actually and I thought this was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I quickly sent out as much as possible, and I still could not get rid of the tedious moments. I just envy people who have been paid to play or work on this movie. They were actually given money for these bulls. Is not that amazing? I mean in this movie that a man is killed and chopped in a wooden mill for small bloody pieces, and a few moments later his mother and baby are quiet at the table because nothing happened and did not drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such bullshit? Oh, and the "dentist's" was chrome. It's not scary at all, and it was obvious that it's a boring stuntman wearing badly made makeup.
