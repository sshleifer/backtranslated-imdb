I have to admit I did not finish this movie because it was so stupid and it is not worth watching. I was looking at him with a room full of children who did not mix with stupid and humorous humor. Director Bob Dolman appears to be so obsessed with worldviews and genitals that it outweighs the real story I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD CHILD FILM! Apart from the fact that the content is so rough, the film is just stupid, has a bad flow and no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story is. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then do not waste your time watching a movie that so badly disturbs you to be angry. Buy your children a book instead.
