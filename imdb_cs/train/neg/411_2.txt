I usually do not feel too motivated to comment on films that I do not like, but in a case like this I have something to say. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many mistakes in the story that I do not even feel it is obligatory to develop because it's time to avoid this experience. The strangest point, however, is that at no point in the movie someone explains whether motivation for a foolish nature is madness due to a power outage or a physiological response to his condition. the effects are impressive, and Paul Verhoeven has done some good things in the past (Robocop's direction on DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and generally approaches the explanatory point or technical aspect of the subject, and instead cope with predictable actions without any enjoyment. In short, so many more reviews here (you want to read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
