In my opinion, this film does not present any new ideas. it seems to me like he took a spear on a spear without looking at the side! it seems the director has a program! Du≈°! I have found that his rational is missing, there does not seem to be room for an alternative view. I'm usually on the side of the naysayer for one, but this film lacks credibility because it relies on the fantastic sight of a man / woman on the street. Indeed now, if you want to get a credible alternative to faith that is held for 2000+ years, you have to make more effort to allow the other party to express its faith. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it sounded like an attack on the Christian faith, I am an unbeliever for him, but I allow the beliefs of others, and I would not want any mockery, but I tried to understand and tolerate.
