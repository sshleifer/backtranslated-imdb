Seriously miserable movie. <br /> <br /> First, the film begins with a policeman and his partner parked outside the store or furniture. The "Bad Cop Shepherd" takes the girl they drew back to the warehouse in the attic while the new cop is sitting outside and considering what to do there. The "bad" policeman will eventually return with a heavy bag sack and the newbie cop does not think there are any problems but still asks what's in the bag so he asks, gets the answer to the bullshit and then he thinks everything is fine (for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process and even once with that scene (it was a bit better). But eventually people start catching, which took a while to think about how it was obvious. One girl gets a voodoo curse on her just if she dies just like you. Now a "bad" policeman will eventually kill this magically protected female and then get rid of the body with a sack bag. From the moment her witch seems to be her, she will return a lot of eye shadow, which means she can be a zombie ... also a magical curse causes all the other girls to become "shadow varieties." Some girls meet a friend who is probably a currency specialist and offer them a ride (they seem to be normal). But when the girls see other people, like a girly husband, she is terrified because she is hideous (some people are scared but others do not notice) ... a massive hole. <br /> <br /> So to wrap it up, shadow monsters kill the "bad" policeman who eventually ends the zombies in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us to continue! Just as someone would like to see Part 2 of this cow falling.
