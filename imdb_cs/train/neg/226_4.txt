Andie McDowell is beautiful as a 40-year-old woman, whose late start of a serious relationship leads her to a much younger man and subsequent fall with two long-lasting best friends. Seeing a gigolo / golden madman in a sincere youngster, "girlfriends" who are dead when they end this "stupid relationship" go beyond the duty of calling "to help" their friend (who is apparently blinded by this gigolo but what is going on, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> this movie, most (like me) will be very disappointed, scale from 1 to 10, this one ranks me with a weak 4. There is a much better material out there not worth your time.
