Regardless of what someone tells you, it's just the reality of the word "holding" in movie circles - for example, "what did you get to shoot this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense. This means that if your head is clear and you have a healthy mind to decide. At many levels, I tried to rationalize where this film would have fun ... or even interest the average consumer. Star? Story? Unique idea? A movie movie that will love children with a dinosaur and a black woman? All right, good! I'm sure when it was "an idea" it sounds good. But somewhere in the course of development ... somebody should point out where the idea could not translate into the entertaining entertainment anyone would want to watch or pay ... if he was not deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something that we were they could not see. Regardless of this, it's a complete mess. Disorder, disorder - sin and disorder. Who cares about the conspiracy (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a paycheck, but I would be embarrassed to take it. I certainly hope she fired her agent / manager / publicist through this career move. Obviously, no, she continues to make more bad movies. And other bad movies. Sad.
