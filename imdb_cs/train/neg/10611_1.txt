Terrible dealing with Potter and a flat plot of land, no matter what. And as far as feminist controversy is concerned, it's ridiculous. I saw this waste when it was released for the first time, and although I thought it tedious for my conviction, I'm glad to see it. Because now I have an immediate answer to the question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Plus, I have the idea that every movie I see all my life will be better than a thong lesson. But I have to admit that I was amazed at how Potter wrote a script that would get the maximum number of grants to artistic advice from around the world (as revealed in the final credits). we recently saw Orlando, and I see Potter learn the wrong lesson from filming. Everything that was needed was a lot of checkered costumes, some nice looks at the camera in front of the lady, and the loose conspiracies that lifted the cinema. So why should not she think she could run away with the self-indulgence of the tango lesson?
