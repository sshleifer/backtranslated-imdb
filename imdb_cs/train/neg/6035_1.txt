I really would like to vote negatively because I think I've lost 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror film ever shot. acting was just painful, I think REALLLYYYY wrong, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded as if it was written ... I can not think of anything horrible to say. And the "off" day and night "inner" shots make you take your events for several days. Amazingly he acted, drove, wrote, etc., Until gofer, how everyone dresses. GETTING STARTED FROM THIS SINGLE COST ALL COSTS. If the only saving mercy to stay out of hell, I'm doing one good deed, it's telling the world not to look at this bullshit. This movie is the exact reason why horror films are never taken seriously.
