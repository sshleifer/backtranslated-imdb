I just watched, I can not say I was amazed. It starts quite well, the visual and the atmosphere gives the scary feeling of this type of movie. But it ends when the first lord of monster comes out. Not only are you getting to know them from the band, but they are serious abuse in the movie. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are the 1980s. As for the story, it begins similar to horror films, people trapped inside the hell of a hole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer is worthy of several lines for possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up with everything but a mess. With all the money spent on this film, with fascinating beginnings and good effects, I thought someone would be better off for the product. I wonder if Lord made this film just to prove that his show costumes can be frightening (except that they are not). So the movie feels for visuals, I think the money had to go somewhere. The rest, however, is a tough attempt by the rock band to scare the aliases on the scene.
