The final score (on average, of the various classic cinematic features - acting, visual, creativity, pay, humor, entertainment, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) Atlantis: The Lost Empire, it would look like a courageous and serious new direction in Disney animation, but it comes just a year after the innovative and almost genial "The Emperor's New Groove" and represents a step back in releasing Disney from its repetitive "Disney Formula." I'm a big fan of Disney animated movies. "Atlantis" is an animated return to "20,000 leagues under the sea" and similar live action sci-fi experiences of the 1950s and 1960s, and the problem is that this version barely contains one original idea. as a remake of something, even more than the real Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame) .The characters are just a little more than clich√©s for common suspects who usually (Milk Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner)) is an undisputed actress. The film also suffers from its brief pace. Instead of making it an epic story, Disney is getting a lot of jamming in a usually short run of time that is out of the way to develop ... suspicions, characters, something really. They put us in this new and amazing world and barely let us get it. Incorrect pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. Animation is dark and sad and inexpensive. This thing looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they have not forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be amazing. The "Iron Giant", among other things, did it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: Visual, tempo and total lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: Possible coldest death scene for Disney villain for a long time. It's the creative peak of the movie.
