This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - to overcome the previous worst movie "Spawn of Slithis" that I saw when I was around 10. <br /> <br /> Bad sad and ridiculous dialogue, incomprehensible plot , scenic scenes, even music was unpleasant. Did I leave something out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI does not have a decent movie. I can not believe I actually spent the money to see this movie. If anyone has contact information for Hyungrae Shim (Director), please pass on my username "in gmail" and I will personally ask for a refund.
