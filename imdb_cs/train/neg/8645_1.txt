I just came back from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than "Catwoman," who had a decent attitude as self-defense. <br /> <br /> In the "Tapes of the Seppi", the film crew of documentary journalists, goes to Afghanistan - despite being totally unprepared for the road, conditions and, oh, a psychotic and ridiculous filmmaking vendetta a leader who helped avenge his wife's death September 11 - trace Osama bin Laden. On their way, they have "produced" eight bands that now "document" their paths and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (Eight tapes, fortunately all end up at points of importance in the story that is suitable for "documentary.") Psychotic, idiot protagonist - who is given long, meaningful speeches that he probably learned to follow "MacGyver" - does not matter in his own life nor to the life of their innocent crew, as it gets them more and more into danger through a series of stupid crashes. I do not know why his back was not just a sign that he says "Shoot me". The crew translators, supposedly a reasonable voice of reason, do little more than wailing and get confused when an idiot hero leads them to ruin. <br /> <br /> You wish to bring someone on their way to call them all fools. Around Tape 4, I started filming a film crew for the terrorists.
