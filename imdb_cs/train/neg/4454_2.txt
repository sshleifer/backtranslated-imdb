First of all a background; I am English and I live in London all my life. I've been on many games at "The Day" and most other London clubs. I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know how he is acting and how he speaks. I have to say it's a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie with fury. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point to a few things. A) People just do not speak in real life in London like this; movie makers took the whole thing too close and did it stupidly. Unfortunately, there are types of hooligans, but those you see on Green Street are more parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded like "English" or "Cockney" like Usama Bin Laden. It's in the north of Newcastle and I'm just surprised that some other actors could hold a straight face to act alongside him-how to take it seriously. Why did not they just get someone from East London to play that part behind me? I could have been alone, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I expect to seriously take Elijah Wood, who has a two-fold role, and who are really ugly hooligans. He'll be dead. Simple. Honestly (like the Brit) it was hard to watch this movie. I'm sure this movie will blow here in the UK. It can do a little better in states because Americans simply do not know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not trust a word from this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist, but it is all extremely underground and silent silence and on a smaller scale. The film gets me only 2 because they actually shot some of them in London. They usually try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something like that, and they expect us not to notice.
