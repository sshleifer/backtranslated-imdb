I think this was spilled on ice because it left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who it is and why it is. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to your imagination. But this farewell fest gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the acting is solid, I think that was the reason why this singer was because it was done by people other than ORIGINAL makers if Vincenzo Natali have this prequel, or even continuing, I think it would have done better and would be a more true source. so I recommend that you stay far away from this and HYPERCUBE, another movie I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave him only 2 playing)
