My sincere advice to everyone: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even look at the theater where this movie is playing! even the look at it is bad for health. seriously. no jokes. it's 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from this most sad movie in this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I'm proud to survive after all! If it's called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very frustrated. angry. disappointed. it was just a waste of time! money went into sewerage! no plot. I hope to wake up tomorrow wisely and without memories of this night! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to One :)
