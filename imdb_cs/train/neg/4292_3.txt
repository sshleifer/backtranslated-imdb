I generally like to watch Burt Lancaster films - especially when you need to go nuts with its impressive screen presence like Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness, as rarely, if he ever underestimated anything. And that is the lack of subtlety that the The Rainmaker actually defends. I now understand that his character should be a showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She should be clever, but it does not seem so when Lancaster blarney flies around the screen! Besides, this story may be one of the most shy films I've ever seen, and it's too obvious that it's a game-based movie. It looks like it was mostly shot in the sound scene instead of in the open West as if it were. Overall, the film was overvalued.
