As an engineer, I have to say that the first season started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat probable, and the relationships portrayed between the brothers and father Eppes gave the show an interesting lead. But after the first season, the show began to humiliate. Most mathematics and technology used to tackle crime is now utterly insignificant and very laughing to all people who are engaged in science and technology for real. The involvement of the actors still feels alright and I can imagine the fair amount of money still coming into production of each episode but eventually it degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting bowl, which is a combination of action thriller action C and CSI style police show. <br /> <br /> You will watch it, just go to the first season and maybe to part of the other. Then I would not waste time. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Let's take it up to 4 stars. Because Charlie does not know his mathematical knowledge, I will not be bothering to be right.
