It is almost impossible to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice and can really behave, though her role in this lapel is waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast ranges from bad to average. In a lot of movies like this one, someone shines with the material, and you would comment on them for future use. No luck here. Creation of the Unknown ", a clich√© that has become a monster-on-the-loose, with the children killing each other." Monster is a man in a rubber suit who listens back to Paul Blaisdell's days, so bad it's good! it's so bad that it's bad, a bit of humor would make it tastier, but everyone plays deadly matte material straight up. In the end it's twisted or two, but then you will not worry.
