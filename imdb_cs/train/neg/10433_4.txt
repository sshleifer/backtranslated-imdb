The combat scenes were great. He loved older and newer cylons and how they painted you on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was land, but 150 years back. But travel like this to start again? Are you kidding me? 38k people who fought for their existence and leave the paradise when they get to paradise? In any case. Sure they ate paper and drank food, but it was over. They can live like humans again. They have only one good doctor. What do they do when someone teeth pain doing birth ... yes right. No one would do it.
