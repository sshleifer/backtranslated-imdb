It could have been based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this TV documentary drama have done their freedom to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was so badly done! I was surprised at the deployment of the mid-air crash, as it seemed everyone seemed calm, surely someone would panic, and what a smooth flight, the obvious discomfort of the passengers - come on! Not sure about the regulations, today some of the security aspects of the airlines seem to be an OTT, but why do your shoes before an emergency landing, sanity tells me it's not a good idea! The footage of this massive airplane on this long-distance run was unconvincing and fake. In fact, it would be an amazing view from the point of view of the country around, in this movie it was inappropriate and it looked like a model it was probably. Escape slides appeared in the front and middle emergency doors, but no one seemed to leave the front, although the drop was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was without fuel, but there had to be some fuel at the bottom of the tank, and the danger of the explosion had to be a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost relaxed and they all stand at the foot of the escape slides instead, to get as far as I'm sure I would. In this situation, there were too many inconsistencies, mistakes and false measures. I'd rather see real-time representation of real-time drama and realistic airplane movement. It had the potential to be exciting, but due to budget constraints it probably did not make sense that the plane that lost all the engines was not really big and you would have jumped safely on a bit of uneven landing but not a real danger! - fact, of course, somewhat different!
