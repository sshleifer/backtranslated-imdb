And when I look at Sarah Silverman I get the same results. I like unpredictable humor. But this woman is so grieved B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and yawning good. She completely lacks anything funny. The shortened way you try to get your lines is dead on arrival, because it's just not funny. I looked at two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine. My boy (at the age of 19) saw her Promise at the Central Comedy and said she was a "stupid cat". I thought it was a compliment. The one that says "Watch my show or I kill my dog" is truly credible. I know he wants to be a comedy. It just hits it like a scraped case. I never wanted to see her around my dog.
