He caught it at IFC yesterday and could not believe positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were something else? Kate tells the Jedi that she could be fired because she should become a pillar of the community, but she will win for him! Then suddenly they decide they are in love? And she is so devastated over his death, not going to his funeral, much less, telling his family a "good news"! By the way, how did the American become the head of a very good British school? Janine should be determined for her unjustifiable misuse of power, but nothing will happen! And she comes to the battle with the end she has brought to the interrogation! The less he says about Molly, the better! As for the guilt, Janine and Molly feel over Jede, please! It's punk's own damn fault that it's turned into a road! Where is the fault of poor Gerald, who is going to break it? If I could do the same for the boso behind this "movie"!
