Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a bit funny this year, but the script is so poor and insulting that young Goldie Hawn (just after her Oscar win) can not start pulling this mud. As a fan who boasted in the 1940s, Sellers usually faces zero. <br /> <br /> And 3 of 10. Best Performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young study type. I hope that Hawn and Sellers were well paid, because in 1970 I see no other reason why they liked it (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others) . You can not win!
