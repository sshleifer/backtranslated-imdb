I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought she would allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride, and I was so excited to learn that the movie is a piece of work. I'm aware that the translation of the book into the film is not perfect, but this movie has always been the worst. Women's names are correct and some of them are right, but that's about them. I feel like I've lost a good part of my time and tried to do it with this movie. It really should be a mini-series that tells the story as it was written. Actors for Roz, Tony, Charis, and Zen were well chosen, although I was first skeptical about Marie-Louis Parker. I just wish they had a better script with the fact that it had nothing to do with the book.
