I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the cast list, but after watching it I must admit I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this film is that actors are unable to keep this film on their backs. Why? Because of a bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are struggling to make this film a different level, there is no innovative story, and the direction is too common. So for fans of Matt Dillon it's a traceable movie, just as for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but it's not a film for him; far below its level. So if you get in touch with this cool game, do not expect anything great or extraordinary. The only thing you can remember about this movie is the Diane Lane scene; the rest is very forgotten.
