I'm pretty sure it was the worst movie ever shot. If you can not make a thirteen-year-old boy laugh at stupid humor, you should forever leave a comedy. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them racist) and very unfortunate jokes. Especially unforgettable is the scene where doctors say that the rabbit died and is pregnant (as I write, I can not believe it was actually a movie scene). A man hurries a dead rabbit on a doctor's desk and tries to put his mouth in his mouth. ROTFLMAO! NO! The strike line that can tell you how bad they are in this movie is "I knew I was supposed to be at the top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
