One of the many slashers that appeared in the early 1980s, Pranks are remarkable only for the early performance of The Sure Thing, The Fly 2; her nature dies quite early, and the rest of the film is totally forgotten. During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteered to clean up a convicted university building for their furniture. However, the crazy killer throws the key to work by methodically discouraging youth one by one in various haunted ways. Using every stamp 'n' slash cliche in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow brings a tedious and unspeakable horror that prays for the characters to be killed to keep track of what's worth. Most deaths (which, we look, that's why we generally followed this kind of film) are short and not cruel; the only really horrible images come straight to the end when the victim's body finds the remaining survivors (there's one particularly bloody decomposed corpse - the movie could do more). At the last minute, the film rescues from shame that I manage to get the smallest score by having a pretty unexpectedly falling end, but this is really just one for the slasher completists.
