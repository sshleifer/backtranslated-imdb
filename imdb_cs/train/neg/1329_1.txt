This movie is AWFUL. I did not smile so hard on a movie that was unintentionally entertaining for a long time. Leno should stay at the table and late at night tv. The car in the movie was great, but the film itself is the deepest film I've ever seen. it's pathetic, acting is terrible, and the conspiracy could be written at the age of four. do not make me sick, jay leno is gay, but not in this movie!
