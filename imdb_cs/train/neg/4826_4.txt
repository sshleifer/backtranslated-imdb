I see what the director tried to do, but he was missing. The main actor was really good, but the editing around his moments led you out of it. The camera, ie Lighting and Exposure, is a little amateur I could forgive if the direction was smoother, but it was not. The sound was a bit off, and it also made you out of the movie. I see that I see that this director will be a little better in the future, so it's not okay but do not expect two movies almost as good as 28 days later or something, keep your expectations low and you get more. At least it was only an hour and a half. Yeah yeah, and other than the acting actor was bad when you ask me. But I'm a movie snob, so do it for what's worth it.
