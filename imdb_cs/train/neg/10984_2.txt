I watched this movie in two hours and I have no idea what it is about. Someone was murdered or maybe not, and maybe somebody did it or maybe not. It brought memories of good old days (bad old days?), When all Canadian CBC movies were stinking. Recently, stinkers have become an exception, but this confused hodge podge of fashion feminism, flashes in the mind and mumble of dialogue are causing the lost time. I've never found Margaret Atwood's books readable. This film continues the great Canadian tradition. It's not easy to watch. Perhaps the trendy people in the cocktail party chi chi want to pretend they like it. People in boonies are a little less demanding.
