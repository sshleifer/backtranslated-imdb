This film is not only dull but also really bad. Graphics are so bad that they are not even the other - they are terrible. Characters show no expression on the face, voice talk is empty and soulless, and the plot absolutely lacks ... well ... anything and everything. My 5 year old likes - but thinks it's a little boring. I agree with him.
