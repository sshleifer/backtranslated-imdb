The biggest thing I miss from hell is that they say Zues is taking NUTCH commands. But she speaks to him in German. The two poverty are quite different, as when he says "well, he will take the French command" and starts talking Spanish. James Belushi makes more sense that the comedian actor is the smallest detective. It just does not fit the role, even if it's like a comedy. For many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical note or return. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, I think it could be a nice movie that could watch if ever on TV. But I would not suggest that I borrow it.
