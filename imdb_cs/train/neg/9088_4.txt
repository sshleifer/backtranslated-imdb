It has been said on several occasions - and last but not least - that watching Eric Rohmer's film is like watching dry colors; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer does not like it (he does not deny it, but he just does not like it), except that his new film, which may be his last Inch Allah, is set so far back that it's like watching drought. Those wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already described it as one of the best movies in 2007 to give you some idea. Reality is not high on the Rohmers' Agenda, so in France in the 5th century we have a castle in one region that is not outside the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is a rough wooden cottage. The story is about nymphs and shepherds, and Rohmer often quarrels with the unknown who are just passing through, so the overall effect is that the annual class play at the school for pupils with special needs was accidentally captured on the film. One is almost tempted to say, "Come back to Godard, everything is forgiven," but even this crazy production can not tell me the words.
