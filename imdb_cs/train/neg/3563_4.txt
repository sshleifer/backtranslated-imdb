Mostly this film feels like a "made for television" effort. Direction is swinging, acting (except for Fred Gwynne) is overflowing and soapy. Denise Crosby particularly delivers her lines, like cold, when reading them from the cues. Only one thing makes this movie watch for it, and it is once Gage returns from "Semmen". There is something worrying about watching the little child he has ever murdered, and this film may be more than some can do for this reason. It's cool. This movie makes only one thing, but it knocks one thing right out of the park. It's worth seeing just in the last 10 minutes or so.
