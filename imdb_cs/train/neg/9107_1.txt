I was angry if anyone shot this movie. I was even more angry that I lost the valuable minutes of my life to look at it. I could have a wax job and enjoyed myself. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a little confused, but then I caught up and realized what was going on. This time the movie was half way and Yes I'm a procrastinator, but I always want to see things up to the end. So I ripped it, I watched it all. Not only are actors not as attractive as in cruel intentions, they are simply unconvincing. I saw my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the anticipated desire shown on the screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with a bad actress, watch it.
