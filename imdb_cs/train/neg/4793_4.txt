It was almost ten years ago that I saw one of the last two phantasms - certainly because of my still alive remembrance that they are not very good. Since I am still recognized, I am still a huge fan of the first two repayments, so I thought I would come back and experience the "closing chapters" again. The third part is definitely the worst of the series because of course they take less seriously and fit into a lot of muddy things that do not make much sense ... Again, when we went straight where the previous movie left us, Reggie puts Mika from a tall man who promises to come back to him later, but things are not safe for a long time when he encounters Jody, who is inexplicably able to take the form of a sphere. His soul seems to be imprisoned by a tall man, so Mike is dragged into the ominous double Netherworld, and Reg has to find him ... By the way, he meets a ten-year-old child and a gadget who's in charge of a black cat named Rocky who helps him the time of your journey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect that did not help the film was the return of A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury, who first broadcast their role since the 1978 classic. The problem is that they appear to a great extent in siege ... Reggie Banister is of course back in the lead role, but his gloomy, loving attitude makes his presence too uncomfortable to like her. Angus Scrimm just did not look completely "in" his role. He speaks too much here and is not as horrible and creepy as the "wailing" that the film seemed to be taking carelessly. Most people's views on this movie look somewhat unclear and tend to think "it's still fun." Maybe I'm just like I picked a thread, but I could not get it. I remember I did not like it when I was a child, and after watching it again - I can safely say - nothing has changed. Don Coscarelli spoke with his original low budget, nightmare, legendary film "Phantasm," which I still considered to be my favorite horror film, and his remarkable sequel kept things moving and darkly unreal and GORY, but "The Lord of the Dead" ) Just looking too drowsy and weak to me ... Including two new characters, Tim and Rocky (the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo !!) was a strong sign that Coscarelli exhausted his ideas and saw how far he could drive franchising ... <br /> <br /> So it's the movie 'Phantasm' with very small gore, nudity and four times the barrel. Do I need to say more?
