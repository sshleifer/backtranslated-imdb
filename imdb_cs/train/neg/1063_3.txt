The idea is pretty. Getting as many stars in one movie is great. But ... too many stories, too short and without any sense. No connection between scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were from the 18th Frame reminded me of "All Invisible Children" - a movie I liked a lot. In comparison, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks an interesting story that is developing - it begins and ends. And there is a missing link between all of you - children. I have not found Paris enough to add 18 short drawings together. Perhaps for the people who know Paris, it's interesting. Otherwise, I would not recommend ...
