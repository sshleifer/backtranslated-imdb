I saw this movie in New York. I was waiting for the bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. She was raining and did not want to wait for PORT AUTHORS. So I went across the street and saw the worst film of my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and see the whole movie, I still saw something bad. The year was 69, so call me. I just stayed because I could not believe it .........
