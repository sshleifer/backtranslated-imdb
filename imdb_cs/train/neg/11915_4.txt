This prominent pilot for an unreleased TV series is a young Canadian actress, Shiri Appleby, as an amnesty with some incredible powers that have to be used when the person who turns around emits the world. CGI is parallel to television work, and Appleby is fine as an amnesia, but it's hard to swallow like a superhero. Familial TV face Richard Burgi is on his way as an Appleby rider, but he can not do anything to increase the strike above average. We see too many drawing flying demon right from the start, which is a bad sign. Also the scenes where Burgi trains Appleby for the battle are really ridiculous. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, most notably REMO WILLIAMS.
