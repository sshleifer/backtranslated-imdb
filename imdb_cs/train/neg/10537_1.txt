Well, what can you say about the adaptation of Barbary Cartland? There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but obviously that's money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony and Hughe Grant (who look good embarrassed) and Gilbert and Helen Bonham Carter. If you really want to see Cartland's "traceable" adaptation, Bonham Carter is the one that's going to be ("A danger of Hearts!"). Gilbert is a weak link in it, but Bonham Carter is well-liked, and of course he can really act and the rest of the cast is played on the handles with tongues firmly on his face (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
