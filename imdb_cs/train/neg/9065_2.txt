In about half I managed to find out that I did not care for these characters at all; however, I noticed a little more. Unfortunately, I came back the following day and finished it. I should not bother. If you know about the movie in advance, you know the lead figure will be a surviving plane - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what's going to happen later - it calls and calls people! It was almost as bad as "Airplane Snakes" (another bad air disaster). I realize it is an old film and the acting style in those days was far less natural than today. But even according to these standards, acting was embarrassing. They were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this film was more than anything else to help Betty Davis help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). For success - I've seen oak trees show more real emotions than he did. Davis, who played a happy cripple (an unwavering role), was probably seen as an irritable and courageous career move. It was not. It was just boring. It was a little tiny Tim in the movie, so Trask (Merrill's character) saw the truth about love and forgiveness (though she was less frightened than Tiny Tim), quietly distributing the wisdom of life and relationships without the hint that her beloved husband had just died. The last scene, when Trask calls his wife back to Iowa to make up her mind, was so affected and exaggerated at both ends of the telephone line, I almost pressed. I had to remember that these people actually paid for what they are doing in this film. I noticed that many people seemed to enjoy this film. If you find it uplifting, it's great. But honestly, I just found it wrong. There are a lot of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood, which were far better written and played.
