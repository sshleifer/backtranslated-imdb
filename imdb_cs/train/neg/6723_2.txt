Charlotte is a deadly beauty and deadly kicks make the film colder than it would otherwise be. The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies so stupidly that you wonder if this is the end they thought about this movie. I wish someone said there was an alternative ending, but I'm afraid it's not the case. As for the rest of the cst, I would say they just do not work very well; although the blame should be put on the wrong script. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way because she was the only one who stole the show throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
