** It can contain spoils ** <br /> <br /> The heroic title fever rescues another beautiful child and her father (eccentric professor, whose compositional helmet is broken in one shot and all in the next), the dime-store mummy and ugly Nazis out - what else? - Build the fourth empire. Misty's costume, like some other wimmen, worsens as the film shoots. The last part of the film is dedicated to prolonged lesbian events; this recording really gets really boring, really fast, which tells more about the creations behind the camera than about the crooked shapes in front of it. Misty gets his nominal plot out of the way first and fast, then gives unlimited attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a feedback to movies created in the 1960s by boys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this bizarre work came four decades ago, it would have been for years on the 42nd street together with WHAM BAM I HAVE YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went directly to the home video. Grab it fast before the print runs out.
