I missed the beginning of this movie, which could cause why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, I have been studying the fall of the Roman Republic for years, so I know the story. This may also be why I did not love this movie. The film has historical inaccuracies as an extra. While it is so inaccurate that I do not think they tried to make it right, and in that case it could be forgiven. The strange thing is that they sometimes go in a long length to be historically accurate, so it ends up in mood. Just like throwing Antonius' marriage to Octavia, and then pulling her away two scenes later. Why is it even if there is no purpose for the plot, and Octavia is not even visible? And as the call of Antonius in his own name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still be a fun watch if it was not for the lady. There is no unique dignity in itself. It is hysterical, dramatic and totally inadequate. Instead of being a clever and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad PMS case. 95% comes from bad acting, but 5% comes from bad scripting. Too many silly dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not see Antonius and Cleopatra, you followed the inexperienced versions of Dawson and Joey from Dawson's Creek. If you want to watch something about this period, watch ... something other than this.
