We laughed at our head. This script is so incredible that you either forget CNN or go to sleep. My dad was captain of the sea for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <br /> <During his experience as an officer once declared command of the ship, Captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey / day and (I apologize) to the table. Of course it was not a nuclear mission. For example, a fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important on any ship, nuclear or not. Giving training at that time is just a Hollywood script. When the Captain is arrested, he is arrested, you will take all his keys and open a safe where weapons are held. It is stored within minutes in a well-guarded room. He can not escape, it's just like in jail. Funny is my father also had a dog on board, but we can see how Hackman left him in the control room. It never happened. My dad cleaned up all the mess the dog did anywhere. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make three stars for which this film is credited, others are bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people live in Koersk, this movie has another dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the real Thriller about submarine rentals: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
