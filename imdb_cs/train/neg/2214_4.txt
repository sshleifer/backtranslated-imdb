this movie was not ugly, but it was pretty bad. Actually ACTUALLY was pretty good! Jeffrey's crests did pretty darn a good job as a crazy scientist, which is his kind of specialty if you do not know such things: D. Bill forsythe .. well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. he is too good for this kind thing, and his role was not exacting. I pursued it on the strength of these two potential customers, and I was not disappointed. I mean, hell, it's a half-man / half-shark movie. They're not Shakespeare. Besides a venue that is full of holes and bad dialogue, I would like to note that cinematography also left many things to be done. there were shots if they tried to look "cool," but they ended up darkening the scene or just coming out of a bare cheezy. they also threw it many times when they had a decent dialogue and cut off prematurely before one could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey chip fan, it's worthwhile to go. gives great performance and does what he can with the figure. Forsythe is not bad either, and she's either a female leader. Damn if I remember her name. bottom line, I would not otherwise spend time.
