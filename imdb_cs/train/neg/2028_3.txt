On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should be completed for at least the entire season. You were always entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by baker's dozens of gorgeous leg models collectively called "Million Dollar Dancers". You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories about their lives and who probably knew a lot of pop-culture trivia. And you had big money! So what happened? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was a failure. A good game show requires at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting stimulus, and the ability of the viewer to play at home. The best and most lasting ones are all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the SMTM had none. The rules for this game were among the most complex games in history. I will try to explain how the game works as short as possible. <br /> <br /> The contestant started with a single word or a short phrase, followed by the selection letters A, B, C (fine mesh plug?). Each letter was attached to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once a competitor has chosen one of the letters, they could either answer this question or go through and select the second letter. If they had gone through, they could have looked at another question and had the same option. But if they had the second question, they had to answer the third option. After the answer, and before they found out that their answer was correct, they had to choose one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in rolls next to each other. They have revealed their dollar amount (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the contestant responded correctly ... or replied incorrectly ... this amount would have been added or deducted from their pot. <br /> <br /> Still with me so far? In addition, there was one dancer holding something known as "The Killer Card". If you picked a Killer Card dancer and you got the right question, you were safe and the game continued. But if you were wrong, you had the last question to answer. If you got the last question wrong, you were out of the game. If you did it correctly, the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no ending, no cash out, until you answered the six questions correctly or you did not have the six questions wrong or you were so far a hole that you could not make enough money to get back. I have it? Good! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I saw was a total lack of tension due to the design of the game. The contestant could pass on questions that they knew they did not know and answer many of the questions they knew, putting the pressure down. They could still find low dollar amounts even though they were deliberately missing a question, which meant there was no "drama" yet. And the fact that they could answer the five questions badly and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. Moving questions was deadly slow: the questions were often so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension as if there were some doubts about some of the most common answers. Stimulation, lack of any real tension at any time during the show and very complicated rules prevented this program from working despite Shatner's terpsichorean talent.
