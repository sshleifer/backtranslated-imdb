This movie is just bad. Weak story, poor direction, and under-the-average playing. The thing that really irritated me was clumsy advertising-constantly-for a well-known internet provider. Obviously, some scenes are written only as advertising. This film is faint in the face of everyone who paid for it. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, do not forget your time.
