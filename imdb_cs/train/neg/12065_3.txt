When I was a child and lived with my sister, she bought every horror film she found, and this was one of them. The video recorder has just become a household item, and we only had about 150 films and we all watched them all. <br /> <br /> I was in the sales yard the next day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy some horror film I do not have, and I knew this movie looked good. I thought for a moment, and I realized it was the one my sister had bought me. I gave it a few years ago in yard sales, which I guess - who knows. I've never even remembered it, and I watched her the night I bought it, and it reminded me of memory because of several scenes. I'm not sure how I treated him as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I would look and enjoy everything at that time. <br /> <br /> I am a scarecrow of horror, but there are certain requirements to consider it "good" and it was very short. It was one of those conversation talks, and it made me die of death. What scenes of death you see are done by shadow on the wall, followed by blood, and if you're lucky, you get so much. The story is good and I've seen some with similar plots, so I think this man should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless you're hard.
