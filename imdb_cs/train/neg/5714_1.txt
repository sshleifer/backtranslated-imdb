I've seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and darker movies, but this is upset. The director seems to be a sadist who has accidentally caused someone to produce some unsolicited stuff. The movie has no fun value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe someone really shot such a movie. Even if the acting is fine, the story line and the feeling that leaves is terrible. I'm sure I do not see any movies of this director. No sense of making movies and utter disappointment in thriller moments. It all has to show psychopathic scenes wasting reels with poorly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it exciting. A very disappointed film and I strongly recommend to skip all such films.
