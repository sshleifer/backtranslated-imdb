When I was born with Beast Wars transformers, I was not too familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen the amazing movie, and now that I've seen the older cartoon on which it's based, I must say I like the original cartoon and live action movie more than Beast Wars. Not that I do not like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "TRANSFORM AUTOMOTS AND ROLL OUT!" It sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" By the voice of the original Optimus Prime I am still firmly convinced that he is a real commander, more than Optimus Primal. In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the web! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Megatron in the BW character looked more like a humorous version of its worst version in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to being cooler, robots are changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spacecrafts? Switch to the original Transformers every day via Beast Wars!
