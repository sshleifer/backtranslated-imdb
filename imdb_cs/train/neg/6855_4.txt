Why is it such that a woman can not be a strong figure in the movie without sleeping with a leading man? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of headmaster Tom Sellick in the White House. It's all he can think about. So why should she have an affair with her? Nothing has been added to the conspiracy and served only to the demeanor of successful women. The only value of this conversation was the cute scene, "we've all slept with our husband." <br /> <br /> Also, the people who shot this film could not watch national conventions that were spoofing? The air between the two major political conventions just underlined their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
