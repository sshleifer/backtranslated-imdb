She's got a lot with Helen's, and none of that's good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play the mothers of a pair of Leopold and Loeb murderers who move from mid west to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, starring Jean Harlow wannabe, opens a children's dance studio and Winters is her pianist. Early Winters (like Helen) will crack. It's all very slow, and although there are times of real craze (unpleasant phone calls, a visit from Wyn Timothy Carey), the film has no real horror. Still, it's still fun. Actor wonders are fine and production values ​​are amazing. David Raskin's musical score, Lucien Ballard's cinematography and Oscar-nominated costumes make a strong contribution. With this, Place in the sun and LOLITA to succeed, does anyone crazy, like Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this kind, not quite a film abuse. In addition to Carey, Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead, Yvette Vickers and Irish Orson Welles as Hamilton Starr are well-known hammers.
