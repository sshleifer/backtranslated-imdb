Hmm, IMDb rating 7.5, good remark, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and I, we ordered Pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi, or at least something insignificant but fun like Versus . But naked blood was blazing. It's a complete waste. Okay, the scene with a woman who likes to eat is pretty great. But that's all. Nothing more. I will not be plotting the plot, the other people already, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch and rate yourself. Maybe we can shift ratings where it could be. One more thing that sounds to me: soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever - well, John is fine ... :) 2/10
