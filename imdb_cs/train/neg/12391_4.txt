The Margaux Hemingway Manipulative Drama Drama, raped by a captivating but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon), who was introduced to her younger sister (played by a real sibling Mariel) whose music teacher is. While the main attention of the courtroom is paid attention - due to the great performance of Anne Bancroft as Hemingway lawyer - the film is too often shiny but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury appears to take over the side of the musician because a) the girl invites the attack on the sensual nature of her profession, no resistance to her supposed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw a couple in bed together. Co f ***?!; was clearly bound - what resistance could realistically offer? The second half of the film - including Sarandon's raped sister, who curiously expects to find himself inexplicable in the tunnel (2002) - is rather devised: Mariel's character should have known better than Sarandon's trust in what he did to his sister, but Margaux himself foolsily repeats a number of works, which indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost instantly! The culmination - in which Sarandon only gets to his desserts, and Margaux suddenly becomes a fearless and inventive guard - but he is a pleasant crowd in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); by the way, the ubiquitous Italian film mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. It is worth mentioning how the two lives of Sister Hemingway took wildly different turns (that was the film debut of both): Margaux's career never marred (despite her undeniable good looks and praiseworthy participation), while Mariel would soon be nominated for an Oscar for MANHATTAN (1979 ) Woody Allen and she wondered if she was playing a charming victim of furious violence in an essay on the role of real Playboy Dorothy Stratten in STAR 80 Bob Fosse (1983). With added pressure from several failed marriages, Margaux resorted to alcohol and eventually died in 1996 for drug overdoses; Hemingway's family had suicide in the past - especially the grandfather of the sister, the famous author Ernest, who died in 1961 for suicidal injuries.
