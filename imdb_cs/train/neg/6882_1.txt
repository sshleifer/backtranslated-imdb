I hated Mrs. Perez showing Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for the uneducated person you've come across. But our tongue is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is more economical than any other Caribbean island! Am I glad we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti without US influence? Free in true poverty, not the American standard of poverty. We are not sacrifices, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent. Our predecessor includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing to do with Black Americans.) The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin King could not have been more than a mark. MLK was a great hero a true revolutionary - a honest man who saw the day when we were all free. Che Guevarra helped Castro to create the Cuba that is today, is it why a Cuban boat is risking his life to come to America - because Che made them such a better place? You had a great, amazing, clear idea, but you were too politicized. We have so many things that we have to be proud of as people - do not make our people pity by sacrificing us. I'm not Nuyorican, so maybe I can not share my views. I am Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have managed to meet many of my goals in America. If there is a future of Part 2 - Less Politicians More History of More Stories of Triumph - There are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
