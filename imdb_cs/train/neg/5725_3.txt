2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; not so decent separation of the Hostel. Live Feed follows almost the same pattern as the previous film Eli Roth, except that silly children are in Asia rather than in Central Europe. The story centers on these stupid children, and one of them disturbs one of the locals, so they find themselves in trouble. Local residents decide to lock them into the theater and kill them. In spite of the fact that I heard less about the film than I did, I still hoped it would be at least decent because director Ryan Nicholson had previously done a very decent 45-minute film of rape and vengeance "Torched," but this film it just falls because most of them are either ridiculous or boring. The film apparently tries to return to the good old days at the Grindhouse cinemas (which the Hostel has successfully done), but it really will not work. Surprisingly, due to Nicholson's previous work in special effects - neither the gore is impressive ... though much better than playing! There is nothing else I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not good. Avoid!
