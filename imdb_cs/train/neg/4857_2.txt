I liked ZB1. I really did. I have no problem with extremely low budget movies and I like movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine, look at 'wiseguys vs. zombies' if you are interested). I really prefer the lower budget of zombie films because I'm suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are. " But ZB3 was so bad. It was slowed down. I do not want to bother being dignified in my criticism. I want it in 90 minutes back, etc. Besides, it took only about 80 minutes, because I partially put it in 1.4X fast forward. Okay, here's some criticism. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> 1. Stimulation was TERRIBLE. They all spoke in monologues. Even if someone had a single line, the camera was working and editing and inserting a pile of the F-bomb into each sentence made the FEEL line a monologue. At first I was thrilled by a 90-minute drive compared to 70 minutes ZB1, but in ZB3 it was actually less "event". It all speaks. <br /> <br /> 2. Gore effects have become more stupid. He was just trembling around his human stomach. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure there really was no conspiracy. And the exposition is really epic! I'm not going to spoil it if you look at it. (Do not look at it.) But then it's just a few crazy characters who walk and defend for ~ 80 minutes. or less if you choose it.
