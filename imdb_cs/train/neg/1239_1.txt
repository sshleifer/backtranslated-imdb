Being a big fan of "other" films, PLANET OF APES, I borrowed this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton. Again, he will not disappoint again in his uninitiated direction. Even monkey makeup looks like the other, which is unforgivable due to the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg once and forever testifies that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was embarrassed by real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. I have no doubt that they motivated their payouts because it could not be a clich√© with a hidden script. I rented this DVD for a special $ 1 night and still feel ruffled.
