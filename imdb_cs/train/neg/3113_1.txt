This movie is a mess. I'm surprised he even got a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams, it would go directly to the video. It is misspelled. He is misdirected. It's a worse misdemeanor that it caught an interesting subject and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no excitement and no tension and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half of an hour, the film is connected to a series of ridiculous sets that are so over the top that the viewers I've seen laugh at. Save money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not thrilling and there's no excitement - in fact it's really the worst assault that's just boring.
