Me and my girlfriends went to see this movie as "The Premiere of Surprise," which we bought on the ticket to preview the film before it opened in Denmark. We sat after the first hour and then left! The film seemed to be just a rendering of the era (and club 54), but it did at the end of the evolution of character that was none, and a conspiracy that was little. <br /> <br /> I was rarely so indifferent to the characters in the movie! <br /> <br /> Music was good. So if you like some good music and you get the mood of the 70s, I think it's okay. But do not expect to get a plot of faithful characters. <br /> <br />
