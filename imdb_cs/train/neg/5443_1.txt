It's a shame I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director could not get it together. There are lots of events, lots of promises, but it all looks hokey. The director did not do his job. The promising action comes from the lame. It seems to have seemed a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV as 1996) is simply not worth watching. Another director would do a better job.
