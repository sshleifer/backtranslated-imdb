I have seen many, many movies from China - and Hong Kong. That's the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown pleasure." I was watching the platform last night and I thought the other two Jia Zhang Ke films must be better. I'm disappointed tonight. I will not be watching Xiao Wu tomorrow night because I've just placed all three movies in the trash! Whoever gave this movie, Platform Ten out of ten, has to watch more cinematography! The shooting was very bad: it was very difficult to distinguish some characters due to lack of detailed work. He was so incoherent that I quickly drove him out of pure frustration. I would not want to make this film to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day. These are real masters of Chinese cinema, not more demanding men!
