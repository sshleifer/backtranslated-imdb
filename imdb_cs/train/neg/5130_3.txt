Janeane Garofalo was very obvious in her displeasure about this film, also called antifeminist. She also said in a radio show that she hates doing "romantic comedies" because they do not believe in them. I certainly agree with Janean. This movie is, at best, small. She does the best, but overall, it was just another boring, incredible "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While some will say "pause your infidelity," one gets tired of having to stop him almost always when you get a romantic Hollywood movie. For some reason, Janean's character is usually shot in shadows and darkness, making him look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which Janean probably hates and is probably one of the reasons why the film is being ruled). It really hurts the movie if we want to buy the premise that Janeane should be the better looking of both. As many have said here and on other commentaries, Janean is not ugly but really beautiful. I never read a review where someone said that Uma looks better. But I said that I believe the character of Ben Chaplin is more than likely to stay with Uma, not Janean. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really intelligent men), and unfortunately, Ben probably would stay with Uma. And even though the director is trying to make Janean unattractive, it does not work. Her natural beauty comes the same way. I think a lot of Janean's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves as Ben Chaplin and actually score with Janean. Janeane is much more complicated than the character he plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower. That's the role Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame because it's really not that good for the movie.
