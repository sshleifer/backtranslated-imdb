One of them: "Why has it happened?" movies. Romance is very hard to swallow. It's one of those romances that they suddenly "knock" - they're in love. The film is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments - the most important restaurant is the most important. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the film, it's him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to watch Groden with his neurosis and Lasser with neurosis together for an hour and a half?
