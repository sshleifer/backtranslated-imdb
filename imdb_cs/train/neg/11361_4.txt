It's pretty unreal what those flies can do ... well ... it's a cartoon so something can happen in it. <br /> <br /> First I have to say I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I have quoted the tag. This suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I have not seen anyone, at least not something special that I have never seen. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie do not look like real flies. At least they could be blackened. But cyan flies seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos? 3) Story. I think it was written for 6-year-olds. I could say in two sentences that it is so simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They're American files!" Oh, give me a break.
