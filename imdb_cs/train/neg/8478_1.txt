This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. The game was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any disturbing emotions. At the beginning of the film she was to be discouraged. Instead, she shook her head and caught her lower lip. She sobbed sobbing without tears for crying. I was almost angry that all the girls who wanted to be actresses had to pull her out. Everyone else suffered excessively. It was unpleasant. It was also an insult to inventing skaters. Jordan takes a month to train and they fit her like a person doing an Olympic team. It's practically spit on the power of real krasokorčálů embedded in their work. A pitiable excuse for the film and a pitiful attempt to link hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. He does not even deserve a star.
