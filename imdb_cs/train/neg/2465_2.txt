It would be observable Hollywood if it had good adjustments. It rests on a typical American thriller plot - "Who will exaggerate all". The effects are below the average, but with the brilliant appearance of the detective, who is the best filmmaker, and is mainly responsible if the tension in the film rises. The film was completely touched by blank video and sound shots, and most of them looked like raw film material. Overall, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, it's a movie that you can watch. I think it would be enough to say on this movie, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.
