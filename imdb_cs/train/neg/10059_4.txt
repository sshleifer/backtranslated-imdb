I was expecting a North Carolina tobacco industry document. Instead, I watched a man who worries that his grandfather has lost his tobacco empire to a family of dukes. And this continued. If Mr McElwee's family were over the dukes, I doubt that Mr McElwee will have some problems with the deaths caused by tobacco-related illness. I grew up near the area where Mr McElwee's family started a tobacco trade; I was expecting more than McEwee was constantly concentrating on his family. Very little has been learned about the history of tobacco in the NK economy and the implications for the state economy through stricter tobacco regulation. Countless references to "Bright Leaves" are out of place - what if Gary Cooper played Grandfather McElwee? Does the viewer show any role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing old movie clips of fictional film? I did not do it.
