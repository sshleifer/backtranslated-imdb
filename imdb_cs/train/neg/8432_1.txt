Let the geniuses, such as Spanish director Ventura Pons, convince higher members of their country to subsidize this misleading film attempt. The sad state of the film industry in this country is the product of trying to create a film of such a thin material. Most of the pictures that are made in Spain fall into two categories: those of the Spanish Civil War that love the presentation of the past as the writers consider it appropriate. The second type of film shows the audience a lot of free sex because the "creators" have no interest in saying. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, we get to Pere's penis as he tries to cut and place it in one of the bowls at the party. Later Sandra will show everything she has got to admire the audience. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a woman who seems to be happily married, is fake at first. Our only interest in watching the film was focused on the earlier, Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this business. As for the comments submitted in the IMDb, all negative voices come from Spanish spectators who are talking about the volumes they come from!
