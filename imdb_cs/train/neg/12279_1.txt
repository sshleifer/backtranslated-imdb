Even though it looks like it's a pretty old show (2002), last night I watched my first episode and I must say it must be the worst show. . . I was never the only one who reminded me of the comments, but I was so shocked that a show that appears to be trying to earn money and I think it was their target audience, children under the age of 12, or people with less than average IQ . The episode I exhibited last night contained so many incoherent stories, trying to include ANY possible summary of the conspiracy that can be imagined and at the same time trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The basic story they covered in an episode: Frat House shakes badly with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be the son of senators who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually a murder allergy to peanuts Senator thinks it could be his oath and the best friend of childhood who did it because the senator was collecting the money for his votes for legislation but eventually got conscience and said no to he meant mulit millionaire. Everyone is a suspect but everyone has a usual alibi (a former girlfriend girlfriend who married a married teacher so he had to lie, a disgruntled student who was reported to the victims had a real life experience, the senator's enemy did not pay a desperate student to kill a sworn son, freely a lot of broken students). Throughout this time, the heroine of this rain is a "who is" in this age, and has a boy who finally gets the courage to talk with the help of his mother, but only to throw him away because "in" the girls say he is not good enough, and so stay with them, she throws it away. Do not be afraid to return with the boy after learning the truth about life, and her girls will drop her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one she really can rely on (at this time I was almost ill). <br /> <br /> This "drama" is even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is. . . you'll laugh at it, I certainly did. . . <br /> <br /> It is one of the boys Frat who a year ago found out that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and trying to reach an impressive real father by killing a boy and dropping a bomb at a funeral. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> into one show means they obviously have no belief in character development or actor's ability to take a simple line of plot. Watching this show is like watching "The Last Action Hero" with Arnie killing 5'000 people with a selection of teeth, except Arnie's a better actor (wow, I never thought it would be a day to say that!) <Br /> <br /> According to the words of Simpson's beloved character, "the man of the comic book". . . . <br /> <br /> The best TV show. . . . . AT ALL.
