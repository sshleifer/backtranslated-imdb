What was the reason for this film? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people can not drive and I'm Kazaam! Džiník, who denies? Come in. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this one. I remember watching it just to kill my time. I really did not care. I just remember: "Who gave Shaq to this movie?" The whole story looked stupid. It made no sense at all. I think the unrealized morality of this film lies in the fact that you can find something in the ghetto and everything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so terrible that there is nothing worth mentioning. I wish this movie disappeared.
