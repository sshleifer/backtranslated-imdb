WARNING! DETAILS OF SMALL PLOTS READ! <br /> <br /> I hate practically nothing positive to say about this movie. It's written so badly that every character is a cartoon, but it seems to be taken seriously. He is badly busy, especially Ralph Macchio (everything with children, 5 feet - nothing of him) as strong. The fence elements are drawn in black and white, with each situation almost immediately coming to an extreme climax. The most unreal of all (PLOT ELEMENT TO BE GIVEN) has perhaps the most uneducated and meaningful naked scene in the history of semi-serious film. One can imagine that the filmmakers say, "We need JoBeth to throw a peak ... hmmm ... I got it! ... soon in the movie we will make Nick a funny dialogue about how you get out of the corridor ... JoBeth he can later use this line and really go out in the corridor ... yeah, that's a ticket! "I award the producers for taking on a serious matter in 1984, which in the late 90s proved to be too weighty like events like Columbine. Performance is terrible. This movie was a dark comedy in the spirit of "Heathers," a political statement like "Network," or a serious test like "Brubaker." Instead, he tries to be all these things-and in the end there is nothing of it. Teachers get F.
