I could not carry the whole movie. Families like this really exist somewhere? There are many commentaries describing this family as similar to LLBean models and the like, and I think it's a great description of how they behave. More absurdly writing / acting occurs when we meet the figure in high school is called "pigface", which of course has grown into a magnificent 20 year old plastic surgeon Harvard (but only to do good in the world - not for money) and she Steve Carrel's bed on the first date. That's when I stop watching ... If you can totally suspend your disbelievers for two hours, then you may be enjoying this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.
