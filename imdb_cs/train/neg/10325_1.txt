This series is only getting worse and worse. Badly written and just not fun! The premise is excellent, but the writer's spiritual lives. By nobody trying to hurt so hard, it will end up being an insult to everyone. Now, in the second season of desperate cast, she stopped waving her hands and resorted to this patronizing, stupid, "Oh, stupid" style acting that comes with the song without laughter. They turned their eyes and shook their heads, as if they were saying, are not we soon? Is not that funny? Well, no, it's not. Rubber disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of corner gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come to CBC, you think it is our leading station representing the best Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateur mess.
