This is the worst imaginable bullshit. The novel by H. Ridera Haggarda is very entertaining and dramatic. The creators of this worthless film will not lie to her. Well, old novels are not sacred and making free versions is fine with me if it has ideas on its own. If all he can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and ruined clich√©s, he should keep the original. If they did this movie would be at least twice as good, even with worse actors and if they were filmed in a studio with cardboard chalks. There is no imagination just about fatigue. It should be bought or watched only by collectors of Victorian novels made into movies. Just a hint, not a spoiler, I think those of you who read the novel will understand what happened and what you can expect if you choose to watch this on TV or - forbid god - to lose money to buy this one. Gagool is a baddie witch in the book and some predecessor to Glum has turned into a nice girl!
