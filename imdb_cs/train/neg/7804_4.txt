TEMP (1993) did not do a lot of theatrical business, but here it is direct to the video you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a young woman at Millennium Investments, a brokerage firm, who is getting useful advice from Secretary-General Deidre (Sheila Kelley) with a wide eye. Deidre appears to be an ambitious daddy girl who does not stop in anything to move along the company rankings, including a top broker that can not stand, and murder anyone who gets to her bad side. She digs skeletons in Ellen's dressing room, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills her while she seems to be responsible, traps her daughter and tries to force her to kill her money. <br /> <Harris and Kelley deliver competent performances, supporting the cast is fine and it's pretty good, but it does not completely compromise the scenario that travels on a well-worn path and offers little surprise.
