The subject seems quite a day today. Personalized for television from Rony Jaffe's book; we are tripping and overtaking fantasy by existence. Four college students are deeply involved in playing a live version of the board game Maze and the Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deeply. Its co-players have to get to his rescue and save him from his own hurt. David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round off four players. Support for Cast is made up of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. At the moment, it looks creepy and tame. But the peak of observation is to see Tom Hanks among his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest audience gets the most pleasure.
