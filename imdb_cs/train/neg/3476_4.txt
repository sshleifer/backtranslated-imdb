I liked it, I really did. Please do not think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. I expected it to be bullshit, it was bullshit, but sometimes it's OK to relax and look at a miserable movie that you do not have to concentrate too much on, is it? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morales and it was nothing, but it does not matter because I just watched it for fun and I enjoyed it all the time. Such movies are the reason why Ben Stillers (the justification 'is about Mary') and Vince Vaughns (however, as you write his surname, I could not bother checking) have a job. It's okay when you look at a noisy movie if you do not expect too much of it and I stand for one, jog, maybe run but do not drive because I do not have a car, Blockbuster Video, or even Choices, and rent a lot of these humorous films and stay in one night watching them. Hello Readers. P., if you do not say that this comment helped you, then I do not like if he says it helped you, then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
