It started with an interesting assumption. I always like the things of civil war and ancient secret society. The more the film progressed, the more I realized it was the B movie best. In the second half it quickly became C movie, then D, then F, then "I wish it was not a lease to put it in the microwave!" I can not say that acting in all cases was terrible, only the majority. Writing, however ... I have never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. The script was written at the age of 10 years. It was ridiculously shallow, thoughtful and uninteresting, as interesting as a 5 pound fertilizer. I really hated the movie just like my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This film caused the cause. Amazing, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I recommend Superman 4.
