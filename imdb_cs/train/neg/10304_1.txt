here, give me your hands over the keyboard, let me tell you what salad you are ordering. Again and again, it works like a spell: is it a genius, how does it do? my crazy detector scared if I even passed this show when I scanned the channels, I have to be very careful (these days it's useful too often, so I do not need to break into idiotic shit like this ... careful with this remote! ). is it supposedly a fascist propaganda that people believe in some invisible realm of Uberman's control and control? or what? why does it exist? <br /> <br /> This is NOT the most important show, absolutely incredible and invented, and I do not understand why it's still in the air. so geeks can give SO much better shows so hard time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this nonsensical slider passage. demos like Firefly (if there were any such things) after the season fall out, but thoughtless things like this that make zero logical sense only continue to march. yeccch.
