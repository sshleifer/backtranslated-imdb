This movie was so disappointed. From the maze that made me decide to see Phantom's love (why is that called?), I expected something beautiful and thoughtful with beautiful pictures. It was interesting, but it often seemed random and it did not make sense. In fact, they seemed to have been inserted to fill the time. Finally, the effect was blurred. I believe the film should be atmospheric, but it was not. Missing coherent conspiracy did not help. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent, no atmosphere. The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the conspiracy was not enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the cast, I would not know you were seeing the main character as a child. The film has a very small context for time, place, or character. I was not violent, but the sexual scene (there were a few) seemed unnecessary and confused, I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure if it was the same man, other men, lover, her husband or she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits I discovered that her hairy back should belong to her lover. This film has managed to do what should be shocking (the dream sequences of Lul's mother) seems to be a little boring. Nail filing really made more sense because it gave some signs of Lul's emotional state. I will not catch the actors because I do not have much work. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the movie is because of the immeasurability or because it was difficult but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not bother to talk about it.
