Slow, boring and one-dimensional film! Good casting with a clich√©, a boring story and a blunt direction from Mr. Marshall! The conventional and predictable story of the most prominent form of prostitution from the Asian continent lacks heart, new looks and depth. The leading figure looks out of place due to his tiny phisique and fake search for contact lenses. The glossary used by geisha sounds forced and somewhat too sophisticated for its limited exposure to education. The story goes on for several hours and tries to convince you of this little, boring, flat chest Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha, in fact they say in the movie, "She's destined to become a legend," I say hard stuff! The film is just boring, it's beautiful to look at it, it has very few moments of interest as many as you find by going to cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe that the messenger you believe is not the message, and this girl did not fulfill the shoe! Borin, boring, skip it!
