If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not. A contest like "make your own horror film in a single day" could not come up with any contribution than this insulting insult to any spectator intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot the story, the plot, the correct dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC actor talents and the borrowed lighting designer apparently forgot to appear. It seems to be recorded on a crumpy handycamer and copied to an even worse device. The make-up effect consists of black mascara for zombies and yogurt that are poured onto human heads to simulate their melting of the skin. It's nothing but a domestic film and really bad. Just fun watching for friends, family members and neighbors who were willing to appear on the shoot. I can not for life understand why this mockery of a product is listed in NO SERIOUS film magazine or website - I have home movies about wedding parties that are much better and more interesting. Total loss of time, money and energy. The sequel to ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same waste.
