*** WARNING! SPOILS CONTAINING HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical view of what might happen to Madonna if she ever gets stuck on a deserted island. In this role, Madonna is absolutely no challenge, and it shows it. It's just Madonna playing the Madonna, and she can not even do it. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know this is really Madonna, you've never seen her!" Right, no, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", right? I know Kevin Costner's doing it. In 2002, you would think that Madonna might have learned something, one way or another, from "cross" ladies who also went over the silver screen. For God's sake, can not Madonna see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the movie world WHAT I AM! Mariah kicks Madonna's sadness on the curb in beauty, talent, presence on the screen, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this view of Madonna's world is that it is the only one. <br /> <br /> If Madonna is to be said, it means it is consistent. When she was a MTV darling, she released the world of fashion for 20 years. Now in the film, she has given women a role in the film AND Society for 20 years by seizing the most hated, threatening, condescending, courageous qualities of women who have been locked inside them, features that are so desperately trying to prove they really do not. <br /> <br /> *** TERE WERE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ ANY OTHER THAN YOU SHOULD NOT KNOW ... <br /> <br /> Here is one good thing to say about this movie, and I really impressed him. They did not want the "Hollywood end" - Madonna's character lives. In a typical, happy Hollywood, Madonna's character on the island ended, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband could finally settle down with a good and decent woman, a woman who was exactly the opposite of his dead wife, and they both live happily to the end. But this extraordinarily depressing conclusion is saved, and once again, this poor husband's sacrifice is set up again by her demon of his wife and his life becomes a living hell again. <br /> <br /> *** HERE KONEČNÉ SPOILY ***
