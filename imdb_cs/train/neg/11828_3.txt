A few months ago, I took part in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if I gave "Flushed Away" a chance, I would like to. Based on this argument, I agreed to watch the film. "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least on Aardman's side), but lacks the strength to put it all together. His greatest asset is Captain Diving Ship Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who should be the main character of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cold, heavy and interesting, while Roddy spends most of her time on the screen. One of the things that bothered me most was "repeating jokes that are not funny." When Roddy comes to rest, the film assures him to hit him five times. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then I'm not wasting my time when I was bothering about Katzenberg's kleptoman tendencies towards Pixar (One similar movie is a coincidence, five are cut off) but I say, I'm disappointed by Aardman, they can (and do) much better, try it next time, boys.
