For those who have little time on hand, I summarize it quickly, in one word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this movie perfectly suits this description. So much so that you barely go through two minutes of the screen without seeing something completely stupid and unnecessary to you. Do you want a naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason why it seems is so useless, though it really sets the tone for the rest of this juvenile crap. You can almost see the deceived minds of 12-year-old boys who have written this piece of garbage just by watching these bulls expecting the public to really pay !! !! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I watched a lot of movie series, but American Pie, Beta House must be one of the worst offenders when you think that despite the average nature of the original movie it's still a thousand times more fun than this hit . The conspiracy is predictable, and sometimes you really feel like watching the school game. The things that are happening in this movie are so unrealistic that it requires a lot of suspension of distrust to really follow them (we're talking about levels of star wars suspension like what you need to believe Jar Jar is real) </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no acting talent to talk about, everything you get is a lot of handsome boys who try to laugh. Oh ohhh how they fail !!!! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was that the screenwriters seem to be socially unconscious. How else do you explain the bulls trying to take off as a story? They give every opportunity to do something useful and entertaining in favor of the badly written and the smallest common denominator of nonsense. Characters have to complete a certain number of tasks before they are accepted as members of the Beta House, but this is mainly done by a series of very short montages indicating that they are completing the tasks, but we see little if there is no evidence of it actually happening. It's a very lazy way to tell the story. (Imagine the Magician from Oz, where all the important events were out of the screen instead, and all we see is that Dorothy is deeply enraged at the scarecrow, and he says: surely it was a great adventure we just had ") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> what you're looking for, you will not be disappointed, but that's why you're just shy, and if you buy it on DVD, you'll contribute to the company's collision in your own special way.
