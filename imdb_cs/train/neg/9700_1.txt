I agree with most other boys. The amount of photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is that the paper is written. The only highlight of my legend is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Equal, their muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds of the old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is hard to describe the performances of actors, because most of them do not even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing". The camera is okay, the plot is ridiculous, I think you would be ashamed even if you are discussing it with a lot of beers. Besides, I was still yawning and wondering how this scenario might even be considered production and was waiting for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was pleased but then he is so small at this age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, 1 point rating here is almost 1 point too much ...
