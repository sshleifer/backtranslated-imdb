I remember when it was in theaters, reviews said it was terrible. Well, I did not think it was bad. It was fun and he had a lot of humor in the face about families at the time of vacation. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a wealthy boy who needs to find a family at Christmas to please his girlfriend. He visits the house where he grew up and concluded a family lease agreement for Christmas. I really liked the attorney's scene where they signed the contract. That was funny. So he makes stupid family requests and even writes scripts to read them. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for love interest. And it turns out that the holidays are not so bad. The whole doo-dah was also fun, especially when they replaced the first with black and parent girlfriends. She even does not say anything about it. And parts where doo-dah hits his "supposed daughter". FINAL VERDICT: I thought it worthwhile to find out if to catch her on the cable.
