I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap. This movie is worse than "Fat Boy". The story is stupid, playing is average and the movie is deadly boring. I do not know why Wes Craven hates his debut "The Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes (probably) this turkey. Do not be mistaken, I really like some of his movies but it was real torture sitting and looking this.
