Any movie so ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of every bad movie lover, but the plot is far different from what can be expected after viewing the DVD cover. Bagman is by no means a good film. It belongs to the category of films that appear (and probably were) shot on home camcorders. The game is terrible. I have not heard and seen such woody acting from Troll 2. There are lots of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumping too fast. The characters are crazy and completely forgotten. The end (which will not spoil) can easily be calculated after watching the first scene. Because of the sophisticated character of the film, nothing but terrible production values ​​is really terrifying (terrible attempts at a realistic gore, a scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for bad movie lovers.
