The only reason I do not give this film less than 3 stars is that it's not exactly the same as Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this movie is the fact that the head is melting boring and horribly, hopelessly British. The premise of this movie is potentially promising, the entire teleporting concept, but the direction that went with it was totally uninteresting. It was rather a film about research funding and wandering than projection of lasers. The actors were wooden, they were not and were wearing. Just as the love affair between the two scientists - something interesting. I have never been able to tell what attraction there was between them because chemistry did not exist. I did not even understand why the main boy he was looking for decided to beat everyone he knew. At least now I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before I cut off my research grants, otherwise they will be dissuaded and kill hopelessly with their hands.
