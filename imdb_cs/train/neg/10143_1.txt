FLIGHT OF FURY will take over the cloak of being a really great Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen ... Until now. It's a terrible hole, no action scenes of any interest, Seagal is not really trying in this - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more. <br /> <br /> Co-stars have nothing better to be rather justifiable load 3. raters. <br /> <br /> Keusch's direction is very poor and it's no surprise that he is also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) The script co-written by Seagal himself is laughing awkward. IMDb $ 12 million was spent on this tedious load of old tosh - If these figures are right, I feel a big tax violin, because nowhere near that amount has been exhausted. FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for remake of Michael Dudikoff's BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this trick. <br /> <br /> It does not have any redeeming properties at all, Give it MISS! 1/2 * z *****
