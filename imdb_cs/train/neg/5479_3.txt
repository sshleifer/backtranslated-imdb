I bet that none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes pre-surveyed Mexico before accepting the Aztecs. The good thing he did because he would never know about those T Rexs who inhabited one particular valley where the locals worshiped as gods. That was understandable. What was not, it was the casting of the blue eye of Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with the blonde hair that became famous in Beverly Hills 90210 black dyed, Ian looked positively ridiculous. At least he did not try the Spanish accent. The true hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also a late television series with half-recurring roles in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. He finds true love with the Aztec princess, and life would simply be perfect if it were not for those annoying prehistoric beast natives worshiped. Tyrannosaurus Azteca seems to use some outputs from the famous series Sid & Marty Krofft of the Lost Earth. All that was needed was for a Sleestak to appear. <br /> <br /> If you want to know about this reconnaissance expedition that could not make historical books by all means, take a look at Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try to sit straight on your face.
