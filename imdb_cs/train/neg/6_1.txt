From the start of the movie, it makes sense that the director is trying to tell me what I mean, instead of the story that dictates the style in which the film should be shot, went in the opposite direction, had the type of stroke he wanted to do and wrote the story, who would give it. And he was very disappointed. I think he was trying to create a stylish movie. Whatever I think, this film is a complete waste of time and effort. The director's head knows the media he's working on, which I'm trying to say I saw the worst movies than this. Here, at least, the director knows he will preserve the continuity of the film. And the actors also gave decent performance.
