Russian film "4" tracks the lives of three (not four) foreigners who meet one day in a local bar. One is a musician, one frozen meat dealer and one calling girl. "4," I gather, is meant to show the dullness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (characters have to make stories to make their lives look more interesting than they really are) but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit all the way. It seems to be a motion through a movie that the shadowy Russian government is behind the scenes of some shady action - it runs secret cloning equipment, sells frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so fickle and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could find out , who really is anyone here. In spite of good acting and several insidious scenes, "4" is a two-hour long competition on endurance, which should be avoided at all costs.
