This game was created by Sega. When I did Sega, I did not expect much, but I also did not expect this waste. For beginners in this game, camera angles work against you. The motorcycle is a means of getting inside. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Whenever you get to something you just hold and do not move. You will never fall out of a motorcycle or a wreck. The main character barely speaks, even if he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are terrible. You are passing the trees by bicycle. The camera fights against the enemy impossible. This game would not even have a rental price.
