Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life, watching how you like your horror movies. If you like it so terribly horrible it's hysterical, be careful. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I call it a fan of the low-budget horror / gore genre and I've seen some good compare it. It's not even about what makes the movie so bad that it's the only good thing, it's so terrible that it's one of the most fun things I've seen for years. If you manage to rent cheap, it is definitely worth watching if you have been involved - shame on you. : o) IMDb needs to present 0/10 ratings, especially for this movie, it deserves it.
