It was known that he slept during the films, but it is usually caused by a combination of things, including the really tired, warm and comfortable on set and just a lot. On this occasion, I fell asleep because the film was waste. The development of the land was constant. Still slow and boring. It seemed to have happened, but without explaining what caused them or why. I admit that maybe I missed part of the film, but I watched most and everything seemed to happen in itself without any real interest in anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
