The main shortcoming of the film is its uninvited scenario. He goes back and forth between Betty's vinyl story and the re-creation of Klaw short films. While Klaw's re-creations are well done, it is not necessary to recreate them in their almost complete form. The Richards site, without being an amazing actress, is working generously. And sometimes Bettie looks remarkable. Attention is also faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothes are well done, as well as some of the set directions. The files are usually thin and feel good, but they have a feel of time. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit and the color palette has been well thought out to make the overall look have a lively, retro feel.
