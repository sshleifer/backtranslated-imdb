This is not a video, but just because she was released in 1994 when she was probably tired in Britain. It's 75% rehash The Boogeyman and it would be forbidden for the same reason - whatever it was. <br /> <br /> I was initially confused when I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been another Lacey, but it was something of a psychic vision of a boogeyman similar to that of the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. When they saw the murder in the bathroom and also saw an address, Annie, her psychiatrist and student of psychology, who very much resembles a man for cheap romance novels and advertising butter, go home and it's definitely the same bathroom. 24 hours later, murder happens exactly as she described it. Of course, we have no idea who this furious woman is or why she was murdered. Then the film moved to the next story of The Boogeyman with several more shots we did not see in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is displayed unlike the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of them are there. Why re-run this movie? Did you find shots in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know and through a psychologist who says Annie is cured, we all know that the bogeyman will never die.
