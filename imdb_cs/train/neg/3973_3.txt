The effect was weak, but in a horror film I can live with it if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was a clumsy and obvious thing that used most people to worship children. Okay, fine. Fast forward to a "place in the land" where they will be emotionally recovering. I like revealing spirits. OK, cool - it will be a supernatural little horror story, with rotting things partly in our world partly in ... where never. He then begins to pull a three-person dog in a nest of cats and birds - is there any evil force trying to attack them? Is there any evil power that tries to challenge them indirectly - making people do terrible things they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo, where the misconception surrounding the murder can sound? Okay, hold on - maybe it's just one small, mentally tangled "Delbert" stylish boy who loses his mother and is on some sort like K-Tel Norman Bates to throw away? Oh, yeah - more points outside: the only black figure appears to be the grandson of the incoming "our gang". The actor plays it perfectly straight, as it can give a rough dialogue, but the fact is that his intent is "Y'all done betta get outa heah, boss!" At least he wrote that he was smart enough not to get there. Bit with a little girl who was silenced and dragged away was certainly scary, just like a chick in the shower. It was just two of the really nice shots in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disparate ways, such as steak bites, chocolate bites, and Gummy Bites. Every one of them is great, but mixed? Bleah! Such a potential. Loss.
