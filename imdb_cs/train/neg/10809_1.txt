This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I watch this movie with a few friends and after 40 minutes we've had enough. The conspiracy was bad, and it was not just a decent character. I could get more fun and watch static. I gave this movie 1 only because the scale did not come in negative numbers. Avoid this movie at any cost.
