Because it's payable, just technical color, costumes and kits deserve some honorable mention. This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is almost as awkward as you could imagine, and even occasional Bing, neither William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely foolish for a freak. And poor Rhonda Fleming has the role of costume songwriter heroine, which requires her to look at Binga crazy and a little different, except that she has slaughtered a few unspoken ballads in a voice that was probably called for this occasion. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible! Mark Twain's joke is unclear in any scenario. Only stubborn Crosby fans can appreciate this disorder of the film, which has a non-inspiring direction. Even the accessories look like they did not know what to do. <br /> <br /> Summary: Boring as hot water. Not recommended for children.
