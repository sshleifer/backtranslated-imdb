BEGIN SPOILER: Funny and unforgettable for Mr. Chong's literally blowing scene: Chong coolly fills the kitchen cockroaches in his bowl, lights up, coughs and blows violently for apparent eternity, then with perfect aplombs and does not skip the rhythm, correctly fills the bowl, overpresses, turns on. END SPOILER. Unfortunately, I began to lose faith less than halfway. I thought the lack of duo was very unpleasant and less than relative. I came to appreciate the relative sophistication of the contemporary stones of Harold and Kumar. I just prefer a clearer society. But the movie is probably perfectly suited for roast broccoli or for viewers who are so weak to be overcome by a stoner when they are - the first ones are sober. Notable guest appearances by Paul Reubens, which radiates obscenity in the form of pre-Pee-wee.
