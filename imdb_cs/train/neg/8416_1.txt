It makes sense to me that this movie is starting to be from Hollywood, because it is often popular in Hollywood. It also makes sense if you think film lovers can react to a lot of songs that are more about you than about the story. Still, this movie is overestimated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles have no performance that the Oscars want. I can not even believe that Condon is set to be nominated for Oscar directing when all he did was set up. Glitz does not replace anything. Lots of songs do not make a movie.
