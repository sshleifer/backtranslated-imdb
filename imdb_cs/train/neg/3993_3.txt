This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not scary enough, so I knew I'd be bored for the whole movie. Sure, there are frightening things in the hotel room, but nothing we've seen yet. I do not think I liked it because I thought there were too many twists and turns; it's old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all that Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for some of the events that have occurred. The film just stretches, and when it's over, you want it to continue because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie is about. What I liked were special effects. Besides, it was not much joy. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was below average.
