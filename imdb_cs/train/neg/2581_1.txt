First, to get out of my personal feelings, let me start by saying that I hate the so-called comedy where each letter is written and playable as stupid as you are injured if all are the result of inbreeding. /> <br /> <br /> Now I will tell you that I saw the first three American Pie films and while they were not the most amazing movies I've ever seen are all right (and a masterpiece compared to three American Pie Presents movies) I still feel compelled to ask what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie? I have a few more questions. <br /> <br /> Who has this been an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the final script (and what was that person when they approved it)? <br /> <br /> And finally, someone thought they deserve to be released to theaters where the average cost of admission is between $ 10 and $ 15 depending on where you live if you had to go straight to the Discbuss bin on Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I can not write a really comprehensive review because it would exceed the maximum allowed words in this forum so I just touch the biggest things wrong with that. <br /> <br /> This plot is general uninspired and stupid and the characters are all as interesting as watching color dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing I see wrong with this movie is while the acting is mostly occupied without talent, without names that are likely to be forgotten in a few years, Eugene Levy is the only big name in this movie. <br /> <br /> who spends almost all of the time he is on the screen with that consciousness smirk on his face that tells the audience "I know it isn It's not funny and I'm losing my talent but hey, I get it for the money so who cares ", nor does he try to make funny jokes (he really deserves better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the rest of the cast is terrible, although some of them were in really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian Wind At My Back series) which is so unbearable that it's insurmountable and irritating (there are things that could teach tropical skin diseases) that you almost want to die on the screen with a slow and painful death, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) screen and lose what talent he has by this movie. Perhaps the next film in this series will be just a soft core porn with story line to get to the MPAA and get the R rating of this movie goes everywhere with the absurd nudity of vulgarity and meaningless sexually shuffled content that should get the X rating (rating board must be drunk or drug when reviewing this movie for your review). Interestingly, twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven performed the Nightmare on Elm Street on the MPAA to evaluate him, they forced him to cut a twenty-five-second shot (I believe he was part of a silicone-casting death) to he avoided getting X, and had no choice but to do it, or the film would not be released, but this kind of unnecessarily offensive waste can be rated R today because it's all done in the name of comedy if this movie was a drama or a horror film with this the sort of content would be a huge smell over the content and it would forget the dreaded X. The last thing that really annoys me is writing, this film is written to play as a wet dream of a twelve-year-old child with an extremely excessive sexual imagination that is quite juvenile and extraordinary helpless, almost every expository situation that has to move the body of the corpse in this movie calls with picnickings are so telegraphed that every intelligent viewer sees it coming miles away and so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never minding repulsive sexual references and permanent unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior that is that this movie was written by some incompetent first hack in scenario writing scenarios with low rents in school. <br /> <br /> Long and short it's time to kill this series before it, tiny and insulting, this cake is full of road apples.
