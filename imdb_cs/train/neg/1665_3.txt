It was a decent movie, I really liked it. But the end is so sudden !! There is absolutely no closure and leaves tons of free ends. What happens after the concert? What happens to her boyfriend? Does he associate with Grant? Is it coming in the next semester? And what about Angela? It is obvious that Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pins, but nothing means showing how he reacts. There is so much left in the air, and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if he's trying to leave room for a sequel or something like that, but it's a terrible end and I think it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
