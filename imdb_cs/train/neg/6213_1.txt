This movie has become one of my 10 worst movies. Grapes. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute when there was no battle with one monster or another. There was no chance of personality development, they were too busy and ran from one sword to another. I had no emotional bond (except the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) The scenes were apparently stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the last Star Wars star scene with Yoda, Obee and Vader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait ...... it hypnotize (stabbing) his victim and wrap them ..... hello ???? <br /> <br />> And the whole machine against the human subject was MATRIX or Terminator ..... There are more examples, but why waste time? And someone tells me what happened to the Nazis?!?! Nazis ???? <br /> <br /> The story of juvenile tales was launched to the conclusion of teenagers. The film could not decide whether it was a children's film or adult films, and it was not much. <br /> <br /> Just terrible. It's really disappointing. Save money.
