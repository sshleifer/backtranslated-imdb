LIVE AND LITTLE, LOVE AND LITTLE is one of Elvis's most traditional films. Partial, partial fuzz, part unreal and partly strange. Elvis meets a very absent girl with an unpleasant voice. Looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense, as with most of Elvis Presley's films, and there are plenty of special characters. There is not much in this music, but what I liked, even though no one is memorable. Special continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go to their house at night, but a few minutes later a boy comes and it's a bright daylight! What?? That's the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) dog steals the show.
