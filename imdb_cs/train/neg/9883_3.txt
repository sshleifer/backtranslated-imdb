Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek at age 16 looks good and occasionally naked. She does a pretty good job playing immature, uncertain 16 year old beauty, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many shots of nice Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> ) Peter Hooten's worst performance from Brutus actor played by Caeser's friend at the "Roman Senate on March 15th." Adds every line in a beautiful baritone. Lower the volume whenever talking. Best of all down <br /> <br /> 2) Fantasy Bo are sad, especially according to today's standards. A few turns in the bathtub and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is rather than Bo's costumes
