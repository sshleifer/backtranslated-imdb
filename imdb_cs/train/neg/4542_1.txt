I went to see this film with a crowd that consisted mostly of "spiritual" New Age guys who quite like me, very much enjoyed this film --- although by those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the film is not that good. So if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual," believe or at least tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body", and do not mind the frequent use of "energy" outside the context of physics or technology, likely to enjoy even more from any book that appears to be based on. <br /> <br /> But if you are mostly in contact with the physical universe, suspending distrust is easily exhausted by the nonhuman nonsense of the New Age and the land based on it, if you also have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects that indicate spirituality and perhaps even You expect reasonable non-wood dialogue and acting, then this is my recommendation to you about this movie: Stay. <br /> <br /> Do not think about it. This evening, this film has moved Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema (I do not count on the movies I've been seeing expecting to be bad, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time she has increased the total number of films I've almost made (D & D is the second). I'm not going to the movies or this, but I did it when I first saw the visual display of the aura, because New Age BS has been getting bigger and stronger ever since. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people who are involved in old prophecies, seeking spiritual enlightenment and trying to bring mankind to the next step of its development. Or something like that. In fact, he is talking about the fact that this spiritual thing is another step in human evolution that should be made by anyone who has even the slightest idea of ​​what human evolution is precipitating. The film is a shock full of horror. Sometimes people move on to what they would definitely call "a different dimension," or perhaps "another plane," just to become invisible to those who have not yet enlightened them. Good. In conclusion, the director is patronizing the audience by saying that the "prophecy" consists of prophecy, painfully slow, probably so that we can remember and leave the cinema as better and enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some very nice natural shots and some decent supporting performances from Elizondo and de Almeida. I honestly say that it seriously affects my ability to take seriously if I consider this film to be interesting or acceptable. It's really a lion cheaper spiritism, and if it's not your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.
