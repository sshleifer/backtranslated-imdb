Have you ever watched a movie that lost a plot? Well, this was not even about to start. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painfully lengthy scenes of our heroine who are sitting in the house do not really feel any threat or even premonition created during apparently storm storms (which are never strangely heard in the house - a large double glazing)? The house, which is apparently only a few miles from the city, is a few hours walk (?) Or a third girl who does not intend to make a plot, except for a surprisingly quick murder, just as it becomes unbearable? Or even a beginning that suggests that there are a lot of 20+ murders in the whole space, even if it is clear that the killer never moved away from the house? Or a bizarre ritual with bacon and pepper, which largely sums up most of the films lacking direction. Add a leading actress who can not act, but at least he is willing to do some absolutely irrelevant naked shower scenes and this video is really ugly, but not the way you hope. Due to the following facts that were simply forbidden in the United Kingdom in the 1980s (mostly due to the surprising conclusion of extended murder), it is nothing but curiosity - and one classic "murderous" murder (do not worry - telegrap it at least ten minutes before) . After walking through the woods, our victim gets in a relatively steep upward direction, of course, fighting. Halfway down, she sees the character dressed up in black and shatters the big scythe. What they do? Move and run like others? No, of course they do not fight to the top and stand comfortably and nicely before the murder weapon. It's really just a movie, as they say.
