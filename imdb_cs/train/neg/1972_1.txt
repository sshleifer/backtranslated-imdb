It does not really blues justice. It gets bad with the pictures of the probe and Blind Willie McTell (or it was Blind Lemon Jefferson, someone blind) who apparently told the universe (?) And told us the life stories of different blues musicians. Corny as it is, this could be the most intriguing part of this document. Then he is the only one who sees the actors incompetently attempting classic melodies, shot in a fake 20s black-and-white intercut with Beck and Shemekie Copeland, who then deny the same songs. This is a good device that showed us why old blues giants were really so great, but that does not mean it was convincing. There is hardly anything to justify that it would be a movie and not a radio game. No one should be forced to see those badly executed reconstructions. It's a pity for Wenders, Scorsese, and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
