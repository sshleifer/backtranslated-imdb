what an absurd story, murder extortion, child sex accusations, homosexuals and the Catholic Church ..... an absolute trick. How is it that most British TV drama, comics, etc. It must include the obligatory Gay, which is really tiring now. Everyone agrees that homosexual people live in society, as there are other minority groups, but we do not want the throats to overturn in each show. In addition to the above, the drama went from what might have been an interesting little story to pantomime, the priest was a pedophile, and there are homosexuals running around everyone, where yes, just to be completely PC one of the homosexual couple was black. I'm surprised that c ecclestone is even thinking about reading the script.
