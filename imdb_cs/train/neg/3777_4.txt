Flat, soulless computer images on less than stunning backgrounds animate the horribly predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing to surprise you, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are always in the wrong time. The main character, the horse spirit, gets an unpleasant voice when it tells what's going on. There is no need for narrative, because everything that is happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses say, even if everything they do is a neighbor. Which would be good, but all the horses do exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughter, etc. There are no differences between the voices of the horses. like this movie. It is enough for the family to sit and watch and there is little danger that someone will be afraid. If you have nothing to do and want to watch a movie with children, it's not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But it is not recommended otherwise.
