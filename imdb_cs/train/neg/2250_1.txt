Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a night singing star. Esther's star rises while John goes to bankruptcy through drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John is doing a self-destructive and red-transferable thing at 160-MPH. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not really take her as a star who is a star when he's already a star. For the first time, when she appears, she sings in the bar back in the alley, looks like an established singer who celebrates in the night, not as a fighting unknown who is trying to start a singing career. She is too sure, too professional. Her apartment looks like a Living Living page, not a hole in the wall where a real warrior would live. Kris Kristofferson takes care of a self-centered, out-of-control rock role as ... well, like a singer who tries to be an actor, but he does not have much acting talent. The direction is dense, the story is slow and boring. But the worst thing about this film is not acting, neither lame direction nor a slow story. That's hair! After staring at Kristofferson and Streisand's amazing coat for 2 hours and more, your eyes hurt.
