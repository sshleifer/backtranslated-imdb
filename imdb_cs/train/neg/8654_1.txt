The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was the tear of Joiseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, the river is replaced by a road and the ship becomes Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Usama. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> in the US all over the world. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out to the video that the movie should be removed from the Documentary section and should be placed in the war area for quasi-fictitious real-life accounts.
