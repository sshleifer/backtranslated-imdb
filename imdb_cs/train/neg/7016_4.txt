54 is a film about a club with its own name in the 1970s. It features a classic bartender. Sexy women. High-performance owner. Parties. When everyone connects the chaos, the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be on it all. <br /> <br /> I will be as deep and honest as possible while avoiding any direct unfair or untrue comments (for example, it's a "ok" movie). It really feels to me a totally horrific film that is complimented by its horror. Every time I sit down and look at Hayek's Salt, I always look for her beauty, which is clearly expressed at the same time with great performance, but reality always reminds me suddenly how absolutely hopeless it is. I mean, really, what the masses left her once, besides her huge table dancing in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who does nothing on the screen, but his good looks and the absurdly dark facade, otherwise known as "acting." Mike Myers, not as bad as 2, will do something good to Film. There is a sad, extroverted co-founder of the 54 club. The type that most observers hate (ie, it works well) gives a somewhat convincing performance, making me so excited about this movie. But unfortunately, it is not enough to save the film from its unfounded and flat nicotine. Most "bad" bad movies will find something from the movie, but this has nothing to do with it. Neve Campbell is not too bad, but he's just "there". The story is boring, it seems that the writer has been trying to create a movie of this style and decoration and forgot to add something else. Any meaning. Every class. Anything at all. Because like most adornments, they are just hollow unnecessary objects that are just a nice look, much like the basics of this catastrophic film. <br /> <br /> I could really spend an hour and a half doing something more exciting, like talking to 90-year old relatives on the phone on the weather.
