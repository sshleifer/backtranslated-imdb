What's strange is that less than 2 hours can look like life when sitting in such a flat, indifferent disgust. If the story is as personal as Sally Potter allegedly did you expect, would you expect a little passion in her performance? Her acting has completely separated, and I did not feel any other chemistry between Sally and Pablo, and tango scenes that should be fiery due to the nature of the dance were instead unpleasant and painful to watch. It is obvious that revealing such a personal story to a movie can be daunting, and as such Sally Potter would be wise to let a better actor take over the task rather than her passion become the victim of her own foolishness.
