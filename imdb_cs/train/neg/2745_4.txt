Squeamish 11-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves into a new city. At their new school, young Benward chose the other guys. They wormed the worms into the thermos. When Benward rejects an irritated reflex, he throws a worm on the mud that meets Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benward bets he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! <br /> <br /> High, teasing Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "There was no worm in this movie." In a related remark, SCTV star Andrea Martin has one funny scene. "How to act with fried worms" is loosely based on the popular novel by Thomas Rockwell. Preventive children into rough screaming should look forward to the film. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat fried worms (8/25/06) Bob Dolman - Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
