Recognized Japanese director Takashi Miike, the wheels do not move with this cruel thriller, by adapting Yasushi Akimoto's book about a bad old woman (and an abusive child!) Which is part of a new urban legend: if your cell phone rings in a strange tone - "One missed call" message - Play the message only to hear your own final words before you die. The most successful part of the film is the immense satire of TV cameras Reality that disturbs future victims but not so complex deaths (which include hidden red candies!) They are disappointment and indignation. The frequent shots of the devastated dead bodies are in fact displayed somewhat discreetly, and this total courtesy may be the reason why the film is so dense. In 2008, Hollywood predicted a distinct drawing, but the US version did not improve. NO STARS from ****
