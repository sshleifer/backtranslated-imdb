The dysfunctional family goes home for vacation, murder and chaos. Violent sexy Milligan in his most home. A little more than a home movie (like many Milligans), it's a way to a 1960s depravity. Notable for healing nudity and sex, this movie is neither sexy nor horrifying, it is now more quaint. The film suffers from unequal occupancy and low productivity. (No one was ever sure where the money went to his movies since he was always broken). It's a bad movie that's not worth seeing, except Milligan's compliment, or because he has some good-looking people.
