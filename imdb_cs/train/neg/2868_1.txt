This is actually an insult to the victims and their BTK killer families. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a film about real events, it makes no sense, because real events are more interesting than this makes of farce. Do not waste your time to watch for free. A low budget and a shameful display of events that should not be a joke, which is really what this movie did. If they allowed me to give -10 to this movie, I would. The action was engrossing, and it looked like it was shot on the old 80's VHS video. Save time and money by not looking at this movie.
