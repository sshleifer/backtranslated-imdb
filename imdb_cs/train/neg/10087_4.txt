This is probably the first record in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; In subsequent films, O'Leary played much younger actors than Guy Kibbee. A group of relatives (all playing well-known actors) gather in an old house (on a wet thread, of course!) To talk to a rich relative who goes into the coma. While they are waiting for him to recover, there are various mysterious steps, including several murders. </ br /> <br /> Haunted film; worth seeing!
