I was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not waste a hype swept across the box. When I said the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty scary, but it just was missing for me. I was waiting for that great AHHHHH or BOO! But it never was. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by bad shooting of bad special effects. It shows a lot of bad things and does not use the atmosphere and the imagination of the audience to create horror and tension. Try movies like Session 9 or Cube if you're looking for a low-budget but well-designed horror movie.
