I was attracted to the title ... I expected an inspirational and fascinating journey into alcoholism, instead of getting a rather boring and uninteresting story about a hideous cattle. The head character is not given much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify soy teen-like poetry as psychology. It was a pity because the core of the story could be good, with a better effort to portray the inner feelings of a person who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I am the way I am, because that's the way I am." And a ridiculously bad attempt to give some poetic advantage to a lower class man is aggravating the situation. Because the exaggerated cliches come from a quick fix, the cheap way to make a boring movie looks clever, artistically and meaningfully. But the "16 years of alcohol" is very smart, artistic or meaningful ... The leading figure is not developing at all, and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Like the initial attempt, it was rather blue. The film is difficult to borrow from classics such as Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but will eventually fail to capture their size, even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the art side of the story and the rest neglected, giving us a movie that is nice to the eyes but insipid to the brain.
