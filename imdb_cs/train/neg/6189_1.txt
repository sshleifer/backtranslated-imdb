I bought a DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw on TV. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was weak until it existed, and the scenes were simply cut out. In one case, Adele is laid to bed and we immediately fired a different scene - to come in the middle sentence - where is the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason have never even met, and they were interested in whether they could lose a few minutes during the film. The DVDs we saw were made by Platinum Disc Corp and even for $ 6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We send it back.
