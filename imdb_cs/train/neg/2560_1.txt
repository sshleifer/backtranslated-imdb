I've watched it well last night, and the only thing that did not do it terribly is that it was first. There was no beating on the bushes that this child was Antichrist. The film was badly written. For example, they never told how the Tartar had done an "Accident" incident, or eventually the policeman just ended miraculously in the house in time to save the child without the police being called yet. The death scenes were really bad and were not fun at all. The boy they chose for the Antichrist was boring and could really choose a better child. Just do not waste your time tracking it.
