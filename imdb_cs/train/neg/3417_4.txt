Wow, my first reviews of this movie were so negative that it was no exception. I will try to pull it. Let them be real! No one wants to see Chuck Norris movie where he's not the hero of HE. In the end a good fight scene was, but the rest of the film fell. I have to ask if old Chuck can hang on with the best. Has he slowed down so much that he had to rebut that way and hope his reputation would lead him through the movie? Chuck is a fabulous fighter and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these features in his movies and this is not. We will be very interested in Norris fans. Chuck, stay the main character in your movies because it does not work for you ... Gary
