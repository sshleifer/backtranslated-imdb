Spanish Horror Icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films ... but a moment with me. Most people get to know her under her most popular TV title THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN and over the years there have been many home videos. If you want to be serious about being able to give it a nice shot, the most successful release I've seen is THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it's an unadulterated and complete European version that recreates a few disturbing scenes and contains the original naked shots that is missing in FURY print. It's also a mailbox. <br /> <br /> He plays Waldemar Daninski, who has returned home from a trip to Tibet, only to find out that he has a contract with a wolf handle and that his wife has a matter. He takes care of her and her lover in animal form, but then she becomes guinea pig for a sexy female doctor and a female assistant. The spirit is obviously trying to "tame" the werewolf and the strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy Daninsky ring, which is under her trance, at least in the original version. Finally, we'll get two werewolves at the price of one, because Danish is fighting wolves! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschy's statement) was often drunk and the results are really somewhat incoherent. When you look at a copy of WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, it's not that hard to figure out what's going on, although editing remains spotty. The worst of all is the occasional disagreements of the carrier werewolf werewolf, which was pressed directly from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR). The wolf dress changes from black shirt to white and back as well as its behavior; the moment the wolf is lethargic in a hypnotic trance of FURY, she is horrified and running wildly from the bloody TERRA. Really bizarre.
