I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrol in the North Atlantic and it was a planned movie night. We all surrendered after the second reel. They have not even tried to show how it looks in the middle of the night. Choosing to repeat instead ...... That's all I really have to say, but they have this silly rule that my comment must contain ten rows. I do not want to comment with a random word, so I'll continue to get to ten rows of BS. I could not find George Goble in credit, but I remember him in the movie. The hall was horrible and the songs even worse.
