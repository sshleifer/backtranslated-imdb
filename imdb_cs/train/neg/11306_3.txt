Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) tested for her life. Since a faithful dog sleeps on his master's grave, he must be death by law. In particular, it is also explained that Lassie had no "legal" owner, which is also apparently against the old Scottish law. If there is no owner after three days, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (John Traill) appeals to Lassie's case, which leads to prolonged memories that show that Lassie has received Donald Crisp (like John "Jock" Gray). While based on an interesting, original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie", he visits several previous Lassie situations; and does not improve on them. In a similar way, this is negligent and infallible; and it's a disappointment following "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and several other artists can be charming, but this position can not be highlighted. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a wonderful life") is one of the remarkable children supporting Lassie; much later, grows up to marry "Dark Shadows" "charming" Angelique "(Lara Parker).
