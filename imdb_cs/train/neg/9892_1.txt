Why is the film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh doing the worst in the movie? No matter what attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to meet on the screen as anything other than sexual seniors. Despite the rich series and costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian "sandals and toga" extravaganza of the 1950s. It is true that this kind of spectacle is on the big screen, so "Gladiator" went well, but "Gladiator" did not have all romantic novels. Miss Varela has only a small acting talent like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has a spare talent. It is a shame that some of them did not get rid of others.
