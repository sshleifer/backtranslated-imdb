We all know that the movie never fails the book's fairness, but it's exceptional. Significant characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were basically embedded in the same character, most of the subplots and main elements of the main conspiracy were ruled out. Clarin's clairvoyance was extremely aggravated, which made it appear to be a much shallower nature than the one I knew in the book. In the book, we learn more about its strengths and the important effects it had on so many people, which was also a key element in the family. There was nothing more than a special lady in the movie. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercer (incidentally, Tercero-third - is a son and so comes after Segund's second) and his connection to what is between Esteban and his grandson, Panča García (not son, recognize) is divided into half, worsened. One of the most crucial things about the book is that the film is completely riddled: this is called the "House of Ghosts". Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of the family is about to turn around the "big house on the corner", a line that has so often been said in the novel. House is crucial to the story, but the film is unfairly diverted to a mere background. If I had not read the book before, I would never have imagined that such a sappy, shallow film could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
