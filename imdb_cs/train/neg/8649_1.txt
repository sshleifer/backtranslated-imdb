This movie unfortunately fails at every level. I have an idea, consider all those involved in this film and transport them to the hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we are lucky, everyone will be shot and killed and we will not have time to use them unnecessarily. Did I mention that I was never so hot that I had a bit of bullshit all my life? My God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen is wrong. I'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row before you sit down in 10 minutes of this apologetic excuse for the movie. If I ever met someone who was involved in this film, I spat them in my face and then did not use them. That's my two cents.
