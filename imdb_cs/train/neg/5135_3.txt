I think scarecrows are scary, so it's a shame that this film does not make them more. <br /> <br /> Lots of robbers make an emergency parachute from a plane into a huge field of scarecrows. One of them vanished with prey, and so others persecuted him while being exposed to unexplainably evil scarecrows. These are hammocks and scarecrows not surprising (when they move). On the positive side, the director gains some tension from static scarecrows. It's as Alfred Hitchcock says: "The bomb under the table is launched, and that's a surprise. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it goes, and it's tension."
