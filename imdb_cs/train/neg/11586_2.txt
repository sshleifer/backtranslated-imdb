Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. It's no leak. I like the series and I think Freddy is probably the best figure in horror movies. But even though I'm a fan, I can not help, but I see this film is average. There is no effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. Now they just surrendered. Do not even try. This is of course production and hopes you will have a few easy dollars. The story is missing. It's so simple it's almost gone. <br /> <br /> Alice, who survived part 4, is now pregnant. Freddy returns through the child's dreams. At first we learn that Alice must find her mother to stop him. And that's all. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly because there is such a small plot, which means that after a few minutes of bad dialogues and creepy acting is pretty boring. In fact, it's the only creepy thing, acting, because death is not a bit cold. <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we should not like them. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Girls are as unattractive as possible. All the cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school games. It's really embarrassing. Lisa Wilcox is still able to bring some class. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material simply did not allow her to shine. It is a shame that Stephen Hopkins's work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin's brilliant direction in Dream Master. He tries to find some imaginative shots near the end, but the tensions that Harlin and Craven have made so well in previous films are not where they can be found. Dream Baby is just another unimaginable sequel. It's a kind of movie that makes the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end of the once frightening Freddy. It's too sad to see him now. A clown that is not funny. Bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
