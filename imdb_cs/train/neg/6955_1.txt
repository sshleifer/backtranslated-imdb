I do not see the attraction of this series (to be sci-fi). It's really just "we'll see what's going on this week with soap," and oh, Cylons are involved in flashbacks. The Cylon "babe" that holds the other guy is quite lame, it is quite obvious that T & A was added to the show. Every time I appear, I'm confused that the WTF should be done. And do not even try to talk to me about "story arcs." It's a soap opera with some CGI. This is not a scientific fiction besides the original assumption. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything that is being processed. If you like fashion, nervous, nervous, gruff, vague working with the camera at the editors, this show might be for you. Because it seems that they are appearing at this show, it is a clear sign that the opinions of the voice fools have been changed from Picard's TNG.
