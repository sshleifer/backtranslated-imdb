The film lacks style, I think the original style. everything looks copied, including action, first performances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc. Yes, there were original goof-ups, just as at the beginning the car is displayed with the number **** and a few seconds later it falls on a hill with a number MH ****. This was one of the many leaps in the movie :) Something good in the movie? yes, for Karen's fans, if there are any, Karen in the bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogues and action bits. And it is done. nothing else. Watch it at your own risk and do not blame the director or actor. The director is already crazy and actors, I'm fired.
