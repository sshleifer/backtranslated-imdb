First, anyone who thinks this continuation of the French connection with William Friedkin is superior is certainly absolutely crazy or sad or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that it is a continuation of a brilliant film that always follows its objective difficulty, and b.) It is John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug trafficking in the collapse of the new city of York, because his documentary approach to action and story Frankenhimer is one of the most stylish directors ever, ie "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds" his "French connection 2" feels like someone who tries to be biting and does not have the right understanding to pull him out. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel to Gene Hackman himself, really tells about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on a set and promised he would never work with him, is also known to have imagined that he has a more dimensional character, losing weight and trying to play it as a direct figure. shows you that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who the movie and story was doing great. Doyle's acting point, who becomes addicted, is interesting but does not guarantee the rest of the film. Unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
