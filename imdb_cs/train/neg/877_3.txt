I was thrilled to watch this movie and expected it to be a continuation of the classical classic "private lesson" that portrays the dream of every man. "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mentioned. It's just an ordinary soft-core Cinemax movie that will not make changes in your life. There's just one hot sex scene on the roof, but that's all. I've been looking at it long ago, but believe me, it's just a regular, dull, soft core. Women are hot, but it's not enough to rent or buy a movie. My advice is to watch it only when it is broadcasting on the cable.
