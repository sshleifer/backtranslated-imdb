I watched the film Malayalam "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which is probably inspired by the English film of the same name) long back. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is a pathetic way that classic jokes replace the routine ones that are found in normal Hindu movies (probably the director did it to suit the taste of the Hindu viewer) ... <br /> <br / > I did not see the English original. But he really liked the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a side-breaking comedy, then. Of course, the acting by Mohanlah, Mukesh, and Sukumari (who have been chefs) was so natural and spontaneous. I'm probably too damn with a film from Malayalam that I can not tolerate even minor mistakes in his Hindu remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham survived. Paresh Rawal did a decent job - but he did not reach anywhere near Sukumari. But all this is fine if compared to other Hindu comedy films.
