As a fan of "Jane Eyre," I was thrilled when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book in the film after the story actually written by the author." Poorly!!! If the casting director intended to cast "Jane", which was clear, he would definitely succeed. But he certainly could find who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the ghostly tension of a novel when laughter floated from night to night? Where was the spark of a child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why did the land change at the end? One wonders if the screenwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
