Watch this movie? I thought what a lot of rubbish was. These girls must have stones for the brains to even agree to be part of them. Losing the time he was looking at, I took the weak heavens. The game was under norm and the story was unbearable. Anyone who thinks watching this movie will save money. The movie has no credit at all. I'm a real movie fan and it's worse than "Green tomato attack". I just hope that this piece of waste will not cost too much for it. Money would be better spent on homeless people in the world. I just hope the pipeline is not a sequel.
