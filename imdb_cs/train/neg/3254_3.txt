Cynthia Rothrock (China O'Brien), Manhattan Chase (2000), made this film fun and of course, this cute tiny little girl fired a screen with her artistic skills and a hot, sexy body. China O'Brien is disturbed as a policeman and decides to call her, ends up and returns home to her hometown and returns to her roots and her father who is the local sheriff. Her father is older and the city has changed, the gangsters have taken over the city and started to make local women start making tricks, and urban people get sick and tired by going to hell for their city. Well, you can almost guess what will happen, and you're right, China O'Brien fights back after a big tragedy hitting her life. Badly acting out of the picture, Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion.
