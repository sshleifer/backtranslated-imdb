My wife and I have finally watched Bsu AKA The Booth. In some parts of the film she slept. I really wish I could give it up, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main hero is so loud that I could not sleep. When our hero speaks, we would like to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. It has no redeemed properties. I hoped he would get five minutes into the car. <br /> <br /> Do not make me sick, I love an Asian horror movie, but Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really does not make any sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, look at the story of two nurses or in a mirror. Avoid Booth as a plague, especially if you have frequent migraines.
