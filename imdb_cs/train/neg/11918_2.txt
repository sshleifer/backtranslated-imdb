It seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good film, and I hoped it would be a meaningful use of time, and yes, I have to admit that the acting talent Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval, where he is really commendable, but despite the fact that this film is failing to make the most effective effort to effectively get a meaningful message, it seems that what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The end point is short and the end seemed unsatisfactory after all that is happening; a bit like a real life in this respect, but the movies, unlike real life, end in about two hours, and the end should leave the audience satisfied if it was actually the director's intention. This is not enough in this respect, and it made me the most disappointed. Another aspect that touched me was the national stereotyping of American characters - they all look like they are being carved out of the same block. It seems to me that most American characters in Indian English films are based on how ordinary Indians perceive the Americans as it is and it is clear that no effort has brought any sense of the depth or complexity of each American in the movie. /> <br /> These two aspects together lead to an unsatisfactory story.
