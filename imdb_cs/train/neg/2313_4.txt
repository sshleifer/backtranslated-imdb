Shintar√≥ Katsu has won a lot of glory and played a wonderful figure, Zatoichi. These films had a weird and unbelievable concept - a blind guy is the biggest swordsman in Japan, and spent every film repairing bad and demanding compensation for criminals. He's a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (actually, I've seen every movie). That's why I saw the last part of the Hanzo Razor series because I assumed it would be very similar ... and I was a bad guy! It has turned out that Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from Meiji and regularly takes the evil woman into custody and interrogates them by violent rape of their "steel penis". As his member became so strong, it's something you have to believe, but he certainly DOES NOT USE. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend anyone seeing these violent and misogynistic movies. However, looking at other reviews, I see they are still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and marvelous combat scenes, movies are just brainwashing - and I do not like imagining how movies could contribute to violence against women.
