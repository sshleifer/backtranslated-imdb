... and lover Ethel Merman will love his loud, hideous vocals as the evil Witch Mombi, but this sequel cartoon "The Wizard Of Oz" is deprived of real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement with noisy actions (and cheaply repeating his recording as a bad music video ). Little Dorothy is back to Oz, who crashed and met old and new friends. Intelligent animation is somewhere among the weakest Walt Disney and less inspirational shows from Hanna-Barbera, but many songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet cry, "It's a far-away country," great Liza Minnelli. Minnelli can count on energy, which is why the film is filming whenever Dorothy is around. Most of them are unforgettable and I'm not even sure that they will have children because it's so long. Like curiosity, just fair. ** z ****
