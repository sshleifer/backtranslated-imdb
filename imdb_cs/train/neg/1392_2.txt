"Gray matter" AKA "Brain Machine", but video people thought it better; screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; it's such a movie. The government has some superior interest in this brain machine project, which suggested four people - who turned out to be roughly a philosopher, a horny priest, a veteran and a veteran and a patriot who had been aborted - to sit in a diminishing room with a computer that could read their terrible secret thoughts. In the end, the government takes over the laboratory with force and everyone will die. Here is a film that is incompetent in every important direction; MY s *** has better production value than this. I was interested only to find out exactly what these exploiters the filmmakers thought they were doing, and blurred in the dramatic drama of four boys. Answer: a tract of how science is inferior to God. Thanks a lot. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th damn jigsaw puzzle. The priest plays James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, philosopher Gerald "Republican Simon" McRaney. Also pose very, very, very long arrangements and transitions in large numbers, it moves almost as slowly as a liberal convention.
