That's exactly the kind of movie that worries me most. A great actor, great director, great story potential, then it destroys everything with a script that does not lead anywhere ... and when it comes to it, it does not say anything! There is no depth. No depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, tension or common sense. We know what's going on, tell us how the problem is going to solve, fix the problem, surprise us at the end that does not cause any tension, and the movie suddenly ends. Loss of opportunity. On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads a number of British (and one French) actors who are all fantastic and make incredibly impressive work with one-dimensional writing given to them. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie," which provides dark and serious movies with some wonderful humor and warmth. I also thought the movie had a great look at it ... all the shadows and fog ... very movie noir in feeling. Even if the actors do the best they can and the overhead is nice, I still do not want to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are far better Glenn Ford films there: Big Heat, Guild, Affair in Trinidad,
