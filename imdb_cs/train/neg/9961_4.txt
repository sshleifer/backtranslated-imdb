Amelia and Michael are married couples who are cheating each other. Amelie has a long-time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not meet him. Two men with their unbelief, but eventually they can connect each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do with this particular truncation. Direction is straightforward and dramatic, which is good, acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little desirable. Why exactly are we interested in these two people? It's a bit hard to see how this story goes out of some other story of infidelity, except that it is much more outlined and does not look for meaning (a pleasant change of pace, if at all). <br /> <br /> I do not know it's possible that I will not join these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that blocking in these stories is typically the same, that is, a couple who speaks together while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be submerged in magazines, etc. Nice things about short films consist of providing a little more room to try something else and I'd like to see another shot
