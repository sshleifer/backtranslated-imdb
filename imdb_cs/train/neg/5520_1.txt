This movie was portrayed as a comedy. It's an extreme tragedy. He let me hurt in my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to shoot such a movie they should be a man enough to reflect the real intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not want to see this movie if I knew it. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of the movie. I'm tired. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. It's been a few days and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. I have never been more disappointed in the movie, nor have I ever written a comment on the bad movie. I really think there was a real scam on this trailer, because if they showed the real purpose of the movie, nobody would see it.
