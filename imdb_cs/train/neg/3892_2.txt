Do you want to watch a horror horror film? Then do not avoid it. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie pleasant. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough scotch. One malt, if you can. If the previous comments were not enough to keep you from watching this movie, let me help you. NASA will send one person and two unpaid spacecraft accessories to Saturn's orbit. A very large sunlight causes Colonel Steve West to bloody nose. Things are going down from there and the storm appears. Actually, I read an adaptation of a book that was released and released only in Great Britain. MILES better than the movie and the book was terrible. At least it's a pretended thing and some explanation of events is removed from the author's (rhymes with "gas"). Do not say the movie is completely merciless. Rick Baker learned that he should really read the contract before he signed up for the movie, and Jonathan Demme found it to be more appropriate to direct. Yes, there is an episode of MST3K featuring this movie, but of course it's pretty little edited. Without a compulsory flash of your breasts, you will also save the healing power of the shoe. <br /> <br /> Please go to the Raiders of the Lost Ark patrol if you want to see the guy. Look at Space Cowboys if you feel like you need to see astronauts. I can not, in my good conscience, recommend this film to a sober film audience.
