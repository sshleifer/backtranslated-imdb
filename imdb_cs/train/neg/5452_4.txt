As for movies, it's quite sympathetic. Fun characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I really would like to be very sorry if I was not overly irritated when I was looking at the utter disrespect that shows the city where it is located. Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet each character is English (with the exception of Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only briefly in minor roles and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a viewer who likes movies about "real life" to look a bit like real life), I really do not think it would hurt the use of any of the countless talented Scottish actors ... or at least get English they could agree a decent accent together! An unnecessary attempt to use the word "wee" has done nothing more than to continue insulting.
