This is just a response to yahoo that says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, it is known that the brain, large white (and other sharks, bulls, black peaks, oceanic white peaks, tigers) inhabit areas where easy prey is found. One often does not do this menu because it was granted to him, but the shark in the film has repeatedly been shown to exhibit abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The probability of killer whales destroyed almost the entire city, separated the human nemesis, sank several dozen fat stranded fishing boats in the North Atlantic, and knew when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", close enough to the water to reach it, were so lean that they are ridiculous. Like this ugly reflection. Ridiculous. Big white sharks are also known by often chewing on boats, underwater cages and raft and surfboards as they look like seals from below. A shark of size Bruce (if you do not know, look at it) would be more than able to sink a boat like Orca (hey! That's the name of the clumsy rip-off we are discussing!) Like it would weigh more than 6000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not have to. The front is awesome (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca's crap (BLATANT jabbing, dirty writing, hideous effects, ambiguous plot of this side of Olson Twins). He does not want to have masters at Columbia University. Watch better movies.
