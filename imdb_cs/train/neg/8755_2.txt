This movie was terribly smallest. I was hoping it was much better after seeing "High School Musical". The entire movie was a complete break-up of "The Simple Life," but it was not a realistic show. The effects were not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not that terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was wrong all the way. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's love interest, played a French guy but had a terrible accent. One good thing about this film was the very adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just keep in mind that if this movie was broadcast to "High School Musical" it would probably not be that bad. But it was not a comparison. Overall, I gave her 2.
