First of all, I love the novel by Ray Bradbury. It is the kind of horror that will get under your skin and will stay with you later. It was one of his best books, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope this movie will be fine. She had a lot of chances, with great occupations, like Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote a script himself. And it's PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> They can be spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, it was a crap. Most of the horror of the book was lost because Bradbury had to be forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book ... have disappeared. Everything that made you warm up was gone. <br /> <br /> And then it's acting. Like many of Disney's films shot out in the 1980s, children from this film can not act. And this made me very irritated, not one of them looked at 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not solved. It was more like being familiar. <br /> <br /> You think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could solve it in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is as if it did not happen. All they want to do is repay a mortgage or something. This is by far the smallest performance. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine as a witch, but the Dust Witch itself was not well pulled. She is much less evil and she does not have such a presence as in a book. <br /> <br /> And everything that was left out of the book. The balloon night chase, Jim's house marking, Mr Dake's real death, what happened to Mr. Coogan in the carousel, the destiny of the light bar dealer, the real death of the witch, and oh, much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even in the 1980s. The merry damnation of perdition on the one thing overlapping the horses was not really scary, and the strange green fog that had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on how this movie broke the original novel, but it causes the blood to fall. You do not see this movie, but read the book. It's the classic Bradbury.
