It was by far the worst low budget horror film I've ever seen. I'm an open guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I borrow movies, I'm looking for specially underestimated horror films. They're always good for laughing, I believe I know I've seen a lot. But this movie was so terrible it was not laughing. In the first five minutes I thought about it, which I should probably have. There is nothing good about this, especially the crew camera suck3d A $$. The introduction was stupid as well as the end. The effects and special effects were terrible. Please do not watch this movie, you will hate it completely.
