My friend was in the cast as a FEDS agent (a non-speaking part, as I recall). He brought it on DVD to see it. It was "interesting," but he felt very much like an amateur film. Well-created amateur film. Really boring and badly written. It was probably fun to join him, but he certainly did not deserve any great relaxation. Perhaps Omaha would have liked it, but this Californian girl was dull and frankly a little embarrassed to engage my friend. If this filmmaker has made or produced other films, he should really try to have a really interesting story and good actors. I'm sure it's a great educational tool for them. I wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their movie.
