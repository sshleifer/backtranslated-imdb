It seemed that this movie had everything with good camera, sound, film, sets, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it was his bad deal or simply a bad scenario, but I would say it's both. Because I did it in this role, it was difficult for me to root even to the very end. I wish he died in the battle or in one of the swords / knives. <br /> <br /> Then the fiery story of killing the king was because the king did not have dinner and sex with his Queen? Nice lame. And go to the extreme to kill her son? And then move your lover as a subsequent king? I see one or two threads of historical bytes, but the way it was all presented was fake. I do not recognize Gary Stretch from anything else but he was terrible. I have read other user's comments on the sound that is nicknamed, but he does not think his name was nicknamed ... after all he speaks English, right? It was terrible. The lines were read directly from the doctor's desk ... flat. It could be that he simply has no voice that could transmit tonal fluctuations. Besides, I watched it all the way, so the movie was at least "interested". It could have been more if the script / lines and casting got more work done. Scene and film crew together with a high-quality movie is what really makes this film above all others. Cast and story were all secondary. I'm giving the film crew 10.
