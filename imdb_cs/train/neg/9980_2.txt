Do not waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women". It's an unpleasant episodic script with three story lines that are together, ridiculously bad for predictable writing, horrible acting, and even bad music. I found out that the anorexic main character was upset to be watched every time she was on the screen. SHE needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend 90 minutes to devote this turkey to doing something exciting ... such as trimming your nails. You'll have more fun. <br /> <br /> Louise Lasser is the only redemption of this movie, but she deserves much better than this tired script. It's as impotent as the older man he does in the movie. <br /> <br /> DISPLAY THE VIDEO!
