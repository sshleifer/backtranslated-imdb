I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to basically carry this incredibly unbelievable script for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the beginning, every single element of this movie is incredible. This movie laughed me a few times, but it was mostly shocked that the director / writer really expects to believe that many disordered scattered elements are trying to put together this film together. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is Gray (Graham) and her confidentiality issues. Things are interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly too much in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, interesting. However, instead of breaking this story into something credible and delicious, the director still takes Gray into these ridiculous twists and turns that make no sense at all. Being a LGBT individual, it seemed that this film echoes what all heterosexuals think we are going through in the process of coming. (It will be offended if the writer's queer.) If it were not for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which by the way, of course, was forced), I would give him a negative 3 stars.
