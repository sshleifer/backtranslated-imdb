Tasteless. I can not even write about the movie intelligently. I laughed at the whole movie. It should not be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story is written, apparently, without knowledge of Iowa culture and the problem with Meth. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, making his film even more mysterious. Why do the characters have accents? It does not make sense. Acting was best at best at the media and sometimes difficult to watch. The film was filled with hate violence and sex. I think violence and sex should make the film nervous, but it turned out to be unbelievable and insulting. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that I could just make a laugh and look in disbelief at the factory credits. When I left the theater, everyone else who was leaving laughed with me. The end of the film was to cause tears, but the opposite. Do not waste time on this terrible movie if you do not want to see the ignorant, sappy, bouncy, clich√©.
