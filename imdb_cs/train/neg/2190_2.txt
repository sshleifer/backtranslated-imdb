** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** <br /> <br /> Jason (aka Herb) Evers is a great brain surgeon who, along with Virginia Leith's wife, takes part in the most striking car accident on the screen. Leith is derailed and the doctor takes her to separate her to return to her mansion and rejuvenate her head in her lab. The exterior of the house was reportedly shot in a mansion in Tarrytown, Lyndhurst; the lab scenes were apparently shot in the former basement. The dressing head is kept alive on "lab equipment," which is almost as cheap as Ed Wood. Some book music "Top of the Movie" later appeared in Andy Milligan's "BODY BENEATH". Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourse with another of Ever's lures, mutants bound in the closet. Meanwhile, a good doc stretches the straps of the joints and looks for the body behind the stupid cuts of his wife. The end, in uncut prints, is equipped with some premature splashing and tearing when zucchini appears from the small plum to bring the film to a welcome position. This thing lasted three years before being released, and the audience made it a bad income he deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERNAL AREA and several others, 1959 was to be declared the Year of Turkey.
