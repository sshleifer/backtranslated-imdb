I could not believe it! Cut sentences? For God's sake! Know what? Everyone is true! Are real people ever talking like this? Do not think so. Good girl! Crazy man! Peel your upper lips! Only reason for film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper is such a meal. The film is ridiculous if you do not want to watch endless combat biplane. It seemed endless. Think of the whole Franchot Tone dialogue being dubbed. When Crawford and Young make a special effort for the sound of the British, they come as Irish. Practical tip - we British clip words, not sentences. And somehow we are doing draaaaaaawl at the same time. But that's only when we were on a really good public (it's for you private) school.
