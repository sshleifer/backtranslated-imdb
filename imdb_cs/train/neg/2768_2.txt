This movie was frightening. <br /> <br /> They did not create any character at all, and the plot looked terrible. It was a certain sleep. You expect the action scenes in a movie like this to be its strengths, but D-Wars will even surprise you in this department. <br /> <br /> Also, acting was just one step above the level of low budget porn flick. And I seriously think so. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the final credits on this because it was just that bad! Please, no matter what you do, do not waste your time and money on dirty movies like D-Wars.
