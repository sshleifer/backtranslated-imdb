I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing but a nice face that adorned movies with typical bold, romantic or dangling characters. But everything changed when she won an Oscar for the best actress actress for her outstanding LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one surprised by my solid performance. However, after that, her career did not follow the ideal path. Sure, the prestige she has won thanks to this film has made her take part in medium-prestigious films (like people I know or doors on the floor), but we have never seen her again in a substantial nature. not only that her character is not very tasty, but also that the film is really miserable. The script from this movie could not be more hollow and basic. However, Basinger brings some conviction to her character, and this makes this poor movie win a few points. This film is full of clich√©s and generic villains. The work of director Susan Montford is really catastrophic for many reasons, but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is very ridiculous. I do not recommend when she was out. This movie will commit the major sin that it is boring.
