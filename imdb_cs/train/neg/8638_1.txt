Action, violence, sex, and rough language are the things that characters do throughout the movie. And everything they do is happening without reason. Mark L. Lester is (not) known for his violent (unwise) movie (Commando, The Base). The story is strange, but stupid. The actors play very well their silly characters ... I'm not saying they are stupid, but I think they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget, action-packed B-series action movie. If you've seen something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like bad movies of the same kind as Misbegotten ... do not borrow it ... and do not borrow movies, which I mentioned ... I give it 1 and a half out of 5.
