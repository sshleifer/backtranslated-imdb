I borrowed this movie for the first time and watched on DVD without reading any reviews. So, after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed that there was something wrong with this movie; It's scary! I think it looked scary and serious in the trailer! I think Eli Roth (director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, is it funny ...?)! She should watch and learn better horror comedies such as "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! It's fun! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is why I registered at www.IMDb.com so I can free up my thoughts of dissatisfaction with it. <br /> <br /> decided to watch the movie for the second time> AAARGH! <and make notes for my partial "reviews" to show how crazy the movie is. "Resident Evil" or "Dude, where's my car?" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and enjoy! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can the script be and the director ??? It is bad. Here are the terrible scenes in chronological order: In the early scenarios we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog lies on the ground with his tongue hanging from his mouth, and the dead glazed look is dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about a blonde long-haired boy who likes to bite people. And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's happening with the forest?") Is "nothing." The script has the bearded guy to warn them about the woods just to "endure". Then the "smartest" 5-pack, Bert, gives us almost an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets the now infected Henry who asks for help and from there the film wants to overcome the record when using "F-word". Bert's startling, because Henry looks terribly wrong. Bert: "Do not make me shoot you!" (forget to add: "... with my BB gun!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bert will return to the cabin, but what about? She meets Marcy and Jeff who have sex, but now they're all going to go for a walk! Marcy wisely pulls out the unbounded campfire that Bert has begun earlier (Bert's moment of clarity for change?) Bert did not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he killed him with the BB pistol. <br /> <br /> Later, when the Five Euphids sit around the campfire, another dog with his dog appears. (Maybe that's a warning about the woods, it's full of wizards ... and their dogs!) They just sit with them because they have a huge bag full of hemp. (Their brains are totally drunk! No wonder why everyone is so DUMB!) It's the last time we see this unforgettable figure ... alive! Henry appears at their cabin (NOTE: He always lay a few meters from his cabin !!!) looked worse, almost like a zombie, covered with goo! He says he needs a doctor. Young Einstein, however, refuse to help a bad scream. He enters an unlocked truck, which of course also has a key in the ignition. Henry seems smart enough to get out of hell, but instead he bleeds through the dashboard, the seats and the windows. The Fantastic Five runs out with armed weapons: BB Gun, knife, baseball bat (* huh? Sometimes trying to play baseball in the middle of a forest ???), poker and (insecticide?) Spray - ready to fight a single, unarmed and terribly ill man. (intelligent scenario!) Bert can kill a car with a single shot of BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What else am I supposed to do?" Bert shouts in his defense. Jeff and Paul are trying to knock Henry down with the bat and the poker, but instead they do not want to hit the windows. Henry goes to the stupid girls who say, "He's coming to us!" (Thank you for the information, silly madness I see, but I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy in his eyes is spraying and doing Henry. And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with the burning bonnet logo he left hopelessly when they were inside the cabin! (Where is all wisdom gone?) I think cannabis began to take its toll :-) Henry turns into a human torch and escapes, screaming. The following day, Bert and Jeff head for the mechanics. And Marcy decides to "go for help" alone, in the woods while Paul stays with Karen ... Does not it sound silly? Marcy could stay with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert will "help" them! I skip my notes now that we suddenly see Marcy in CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did you get a canoe? Does he even know where he is going? Anyway, he goes to the seafront and finds a large and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like most horror films, goes inside the cabin and says, "Hi, is there someone there?" Bert suddenly jumps up behind the furniture and scares her (and I first). And Jeff also comes. How did they get here? Sailed across the river ??? Do you see how insignificant the script is! <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston will meet Paul in the cabin. Somehow he will not notice the blood on their truck. It will take about 35 minutes to view and I decided to stop torturing and releasing DVDs. (Before I turn my own eyes! Now it's funny!) If you liked this movie, do a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" or "The Return of the Living Dead". Then you will see that they are much more fun than this ... thing. Even "Toxic Avenger part 2," which is also a miserable movie, is much more fun than "Cabin Fever".
