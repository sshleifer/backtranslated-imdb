I have to admit that I do not have many New Age mumbo jumbo. When people are "exchanging energy", I always wonder how much kJ is really exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the problem of global warming. When I "force" energy, I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and they are still without the Nobel Prize. When people feel how well their instinct allows them to navigate through the complexities of life, I wonder how they can not do a simple thing like finding a station. But again, this is not the first film with conspiracy holes, and most of them are perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with The Celestine Prophecy, I would not burn this movie, but it is not. Every actor seems to be bored of boredom and can not understand what to do on the spot. This leads to many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s" as I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with someone who really knows what she's talking about and pretends she understands. <br /> <br /> The direction is also insipid. You could expect something more from the man who did "What Dreams Can Come", but hey, I assumed he paid well for this job and accepted the attitude of a taxi driver in New York: "It's your money, buddy. one who seems to be having fun is the common bad guy JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he work, he is one of the few actors in this movie, which can have some wise cracks on this eternal and terribly boring neo-ravine. This movie is very similar to one of this date dinner when you find that your date is really horrible holes that seem to be unable to close. At one point, it seems that the words turn into small ping pong balls that are continuously thrown into the head until it hurts. If you want to have a good time and you have to choose between this film and put the safety pins in your eyelids, be advised: select the other.
