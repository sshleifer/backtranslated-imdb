I'm not a big fan of slasher as a genre, but even under low-budget standards, it's really unbearable. Even at the level of nudity and gore it is incredibly boring (there is something of both, but it's all ... meh). Before the revolution of the home video, it may not even have been released theatrically (although it may have, after all, * Plan 9 From Outer Space * play in theaters). The whole movie is exactly one good (and competently released) line; I suppose they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> Negotiations are among the worst I've ever seen. I think even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be ridiculously hammocks, which can be fun to watch. By the way, most of his actors could almost be literate. Here, those who do not read their lines as cigar Indians sound like phonetically. And this film has one difference: for most of the film he can be badly undermined, then laughs for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I had to name an actress who played the receptionist, except for not a wooden one, not that it was good but definitely not wooden.) Even the worst movements of the slasher are generally good for a few Puritan meditations about their grotesque offensive, but this does not even seem to be something to morally outrage. And you know the funniest thing? They obviously expected to do the sequel! It's so bad and boring to make it strangely fascinating. I sat in the eyes of many videos and I wondered why someone would go about doing it.
