When a comedic movie enjoys its amazing soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not acting as a top movie. I rented this movie with friends who expected to get some giggles but overall they would get most of our laughs that made fun of the movie. We could not pick a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The film could be fine with a few changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly executed and placed. The fat guy in the movie wanted to kill us, blessed him for trying out the scene and the scene out, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If they pulled him out of the movie, everything could be tolerable. There were some humorous jokes, I believe one was when a group of boys stole one of their parents porn movies and it turned out to be gay porn. But it is best to tell the comedy simply the introductory gag for a fat child. She is wearing a shirt in a colored shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done. Finishing, the film editor could save the film by removing the fat child, cutting off the 20 minutes of the school scene and ending, which is more than thirty seconds of random squabbles. OH, BTW, there are two good elements the movie has. Kade Hardison plays his role awesome and makes his jokes so that no one is omitted or underestimated. Another redemption of the feature film is beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored mostly by the film, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or rent this. She did not look at me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
