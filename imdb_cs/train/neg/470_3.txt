I loved this film as a child, but when I see it again 20 or more years later, it's really upset. Up the academy could have been ahead of us in 1980, but nowadays it has nothing to offer! Films like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better than today. No T & A. No great jokes, with the exception of one-time ads, have already been heard a million times. I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the jewel I remembered. Well, I was gone! The soundtrack had only 2-3 broadly recognizable hits (not the compilation that others had mentioned) and frequent voices were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the characters were before they said it. Yeah, I watched this movie so much! <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm writing this review is to give my two cents why this film should be forgotten, sorry. :(
