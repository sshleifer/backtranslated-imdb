I got that figure of Diehu is designed as the microcosm of America itself - to see the Arab terrorists under each rock only to finally find out that it's his own action all the time he got into this siege and really, if he practiced goodwill all people will be rainbows and lollipops. I'm sorry you've done some great movies in the past that remain neutral from politics, and for good reason the polemics are a weak point and they weaken the well-created, stunning movie with absurd characters, dialogue, and rendering. You are more fortunate with the next click. Another thing that pulled me out was the frantic thing of LA homeless who was there for hunger, these people have not enough to eat. Indeed, these people do not eat regally, but the real hunger of these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-esteem, dignity that can not be given to a person. Yeah, these people are hungry, and if they need it, they're available. Less than a hunger center in America, I say it's more a center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering, and economic devastation. The solution to hunger, though noble efforts, is to help a deeper systematic social and age-old human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good and Michelle Williams was cute as a young (clich√©) old soul.
