or anyone who prayed that Al Cliver is fighting a naked, high black guy in full nelson, your movie came! Film star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a ransom of $ 6 million to be delivered to an island sanctuary. Not to be counted, Vietnamese vet Peter Weston (Cliver) hired a film producer to save the girl. And what they do not really count for is a local tribe who likes to offer young women their bloody eyes to their ghastly cannibal god. <br /> <br /> Quite the same shot as CANNIBALS, this is much better in terms of entertainment value, especially thanks to the merry oak track and the extremely gothic monster with outraged eyes (Franco confirms that the disc conversation was divided ping pong). Franco gains strong support from EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most damaging things I've ever seen as a person who is not altogether shown - in close proximity - trying to be his). The film contains tons of nudity and gore (Tempra variety). The most important place for me was the slow world war between Clive and Antonio de Cabo in splashing waves. Unfortunately, ol 'Jess will put this one on an amazing (and sometimes a stormy) hour and 40 minutes when it should run for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Mostly DVD Severin looks quite nice, but some darker scenes have some strange images of ghosts. Also, one long part of the dialogue is in Spanish without a pedestal (they are a choice, but only when you listen to a French track). Franco gives a nice 16-minute interview about the film and has much more enjoyable things about Buchfellner than his star CANNIBALS Sabrina Siani.
