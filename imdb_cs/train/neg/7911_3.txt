It was not quite remarkable to make it really terrible, it was simply unbelievable. The story was not half bad, but executions were terrible. <br /> <br /> We start by moving too fast to emotionally engaging in what's going on. It was wrong. The dialogue was absolutely bulletproof, flat and boring. And the characters, the amazing cupboards, made Deadpool boring. How the hell are you doing Deadpool boring? It was not a joke. He was not crazy. He was just an unpleasant guy with a few swords that he did not even know how to use it properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And when did telekenisis have the cards just float and fly around or super force to leap hundreds of meters into the air? And what about the stupid helicopter? I think we know they are mutants, but they still exist in the field of physics. Employees with a round bo is not a helicopter blade, you can not fly swiftly. Which Gambit would not be able to do it anyway. Deadpool, especially when you use it as a substitute for true combat choreography. And this film is evidence that wire work should be used only by combat coordinators who know WTH who do, and know better than to use it in everyone. single. shot. as a replacement for the real choreography of the fighting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged and left it all to boys of special effects. And then you set out, all the mutants who did not do anything. Even the mutants who have been shown to have strength in their cells (dearly, they see Quicksilver nod), all got out when they went out. Only Emma - really lame-for-this-film-Frost and Cyclops did something. And when was Logan so nice? And stupid, "The ball will remember." Do not you think Xavier and the X-Men would notice the big crowded ball holes in the adamantium skull when X-rayed in the X1? I liked Lye Schrieber, but in fact he brought a good script to the screenplay. He made one of Marvel's simple super villains who really felt. But he could not save the film from his own epic quail. Seriously, this was the "Daredevil" level suck. A decent story, good actors, absolutely terrible execution.
