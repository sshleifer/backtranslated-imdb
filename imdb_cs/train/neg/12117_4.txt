You can say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis, it can work, it is possible, it seems like a terrible choice for me, but maybe I would have an open mind, maybe I will be surprised." <br /> <br /> NOT ! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But it's a terrible Elvis. It's too short, too weak, too sharp ... but you've already imagined how bad it will be. Add a hockey black wig and a gauntlet with heavy hands and a mask, and it's a big, tedious mess. The best I can say is that Johnson's acting is decent, and he's so far away from his impersonation, and after some time you no longer think of him as Elvisa. You see him as some other crazy pop star. At this level, the movie becomes observable. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally occupied as Linda Thompson's beauty queen. But she is attractive in itself and plays a role with honesty, elegance and intelligence that we expect from all her roles. There can be too much intelligence in its performance. You have to be a bit of a bout to keep drug abuse drugs. There is nothing new about this story; we have heard it many times. If you are looking for new information or a preview, you will not find it. It is narrated as a love story - unused: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for Drugs.
