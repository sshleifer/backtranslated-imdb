Other variations and improvisation on the famous and beloved children's fairy tale, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast are trying to introduce (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing, but in fact rather stupid and comic) what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to be too deep for this movie. I do not want to say at length that it is a serious and dark study of such subjects as sexual frustration, desire, fulfillment or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even tell her horror-erotic film. It's more of a parody of all genres touching or mentioning, even though it has shocking moments in all departments that will surely remain in your memory. A long (too long) scene between a noble young woman and supposedly scary, but the most popular one I've ever seen in a really impressive film ... well anatomical, is set to Scarlatti's clavicultural music and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed loudly over the exaggerated details of the meeting. The Moral Scene Is - Beauty can and defeat the monster. The question is, who is the target audience of the movie? For erotic images it's too verbose; for an artistic film - has so many scenes with a clean headband of utter insanity and say a sudden ending. IMO, the filmmaker did not think it was a serious drama. Like a parody of a house of art / horror / eroticism, it's fun and certainly original. Laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of curious beauties and greedy animals is certainly not recommended to work with children. The opening scene, which can shock the unprepared spectator much more than the infamous scene of bestiality, can be successfully used on the Discovery Channel for a program like "In the world of animals - dressing horse habits and rituals."
