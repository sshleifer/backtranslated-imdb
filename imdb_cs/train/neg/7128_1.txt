I am a stupid person to rent DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, who have made this stupid film, have never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites, including the ALEXA 16K mine. They broke me for a deal and now I'm out of $ 16,000 and I've lost my personal time (peter rapport Palisades Media), you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy a movie !!! This is upset and people behind him are ripoff artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has cast losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
