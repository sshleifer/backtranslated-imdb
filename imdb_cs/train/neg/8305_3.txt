Like most people, I love "The Christmas Story". I've never heard of this movie and maybe for good reason - it's terrible. The same environment, the same narrator, the same director, but the missing heat fuzziness of the original. Charles Grodin to replace Darrin McGavin with Darren McGavin, but could not imagine being able to substitute him. The story looks forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In the "Christmas Story" Ralphie's obsession with BB weapons looks cute, but his obsession with this film is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighboring bully, is replaced in this film by another child with braces and a strange hat, but with a small amount of terrible appeals by Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to match the original, even if this film was shot with the original crew.
