He noticed someone else whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle switching the road. Just as in one scene, it is a residential area with corridors, along the highway with several paths with a divider, next to a two-lane road with double yellow aisles. I understand the low budget, but it was just a sloppy film work. I also read other reviews and disagreed that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. But if you find his / her work not funny, I would suggest that you be discarded from this moment.
