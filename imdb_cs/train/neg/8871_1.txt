I see about 200 movies a year in theaters and at home, and I can safely say that this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen (if not at all, however, I have not actually seen Quest of the Delta Knights yet). This film is just a bad joke after a bad joke directed at the 13-year-old and because I was dissatisfied with his viewing on a bus trip, I could not leave. <br /> <br /> Make a favor and skip it one in the driveway. Four dollars could be better spent on a movie based on the numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
