"Igor and Lunatics" is a totally awkward and amateur attempt at horror film crazy hippie-culture-killing. Apparently even almost twenty years later, Charles Manson still inspired blatant but incompetent brooms. This is a typical production of Troma, which means, in other words, there are a lot of boring and totally irrelevant paddings that accompany a meaningless conspiracy. Is there a little random gore and homeless on the screen? which is not bad? but it's all so absurd and ugly that it gets worried. "Igor and Lunatics" is so desperate to use many records twice, such as circles that see killing, for example. The disjointed conspiracy attempts to tell the story of the hippie cult run drug addicted and Charlie Manson, who acts like Paul. One of the lesser appraised disciples of Paul, named Igor, is a little too obsessed with biblical stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the whole cult to fall further into criminal madness. Just to illustrate by way of a small example exactly how crazy Igor is: she tears the heart straight out of her chest really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There is a disturbing synthesizer soundtrack and some really embarrassing delusional pseudo-art tricks of the camera, such as slow-motion shots and furious dreams. Perhaps there is one sequence that more or less qualifies as useful for garbage fans and that "when a poor girl cuts in half with a machete. For no special reason the camera holds the blade in the stomach for fifteen seconds.
