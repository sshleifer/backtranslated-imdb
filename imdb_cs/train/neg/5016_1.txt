The name Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive VHS envelope made me buy and watch this movie and I expect to see a good teen slash. What the hell! Full clich√©s, scripts, dialogues and performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible? summarizing, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just a very boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, three couples, together as a group of friends, but really very ugly people who seem to be enemies, play a ridiculous nonsense game called "Taboo" and each of them writes yes or no for some taboo. That is: no previous character development, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationships. A year later an ellipse appears, and the same group gathers at the New Year's Eve party and offends one another in a very awkward way. But the storyline and curses are so ridiculous, predictable, average, and unbelievable that I do not deserve any other line in my review. One advice: do not waste time or money on this waste, you will surely regret it. My voice is one (terrible). Name (Brazil): "Taboo" Jogando Com by Assassino "(" Taboo "Game with Assassin")
