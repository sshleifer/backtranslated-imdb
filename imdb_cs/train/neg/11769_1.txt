Someone owes Ang Lee for an apology. In fact, a lot of people do it. And I'll start. I've never been interested in the Angle Lee Hulk movie, due to almost unanimous bad reviews. Even premium cable channels rarely showed. I finally decided to watch yesterday on the US network and wow .... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's boring! I almost did not do it through Hulk Ang Lee. Eric Bana was unimpressive, Nick Nolte was terrible, Sam Elliott was unlike (and that's no fun, it's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Ban, because his unfinished face was the easiest to imitate with computer graphics - and it was obvious that Ang Lee Hulk had in his face to remind Bruce Banner in his hostile state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle, I was ready to admit Hulk for the worst superhero film ever. But then something happened. Approximately three quarters of the trip in this tedious movie was really exciting - and courageously saying - reasonably convincing - an extended action scene that begins with Hulk, who emerges from the chamber at the military base and fights against the M1 and Comanche Tankers in the desert and then the F22 raptor into the stratosphere, just to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best action sequences ever shot for a superhero movie. And I must say that CGI is pretty good. That does not mean that Hulk was absolutely convincing. But it did not require much more suspension of infidelity than is required in many action films without a superhero. And that's pretty good performance. Of course, the end was really stupid when Father Bruce Banner changed into a sort that changed shape, but the earlier long action sequence had prompted one of the heroic heroes to shame. And overall, besides animated mutant dogs, it really seemed that CGI in Hulk was trying to convince him that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected. OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It's also boring! It's just a few Hulk performances and here's a thing - CGI in this movie is terrible. Perhaps Hulk in the Ang Lee version sometimes looked fake and cartooned on the others - but he had his compelling moments. Unbelievable Hulk looked ridiculous. It had a skin tone and muscle tone that did not even look like a living thing, just a textured computer. It was really absurd. Lighting, the environment and facial effects did not look 5 years younger than Ang Lee, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no justification. We really live at a time when computer programmers can ruin the film as thoroughly as if someone else was a director, actor or cameraman. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the writer and director of this film seemed Ang Lee "Failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is virtually emotionless. The general is so tirelessly, unlikely to be one-dimensional that he seems more real than Hulk. Interest in love is not convincing (I have to give Liv Tyler the feeling that she is more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are fairly easy to see). Tim Blake Nelson survives almost the same way as Nick Nolte, despite being in the film for just a few minutes. Hulk really does not do much in this movie, definitely no more than Ang Lee. Unbelievable Hulk was a bit faster, but because nothing really happened, it did not cost much. Oh, yeah, the villain is as fake as Hulk. In fact, he is much more interesting than a man than a monster. <br /> <br /> I can finally say that the Ang Lee version is better: if I ever had a chance to see Ang Lee again, I could meet him to see a good action sequence, or else try to appreciate the dialogue a bit more (I could probably move forward quickly to good works). But in The Incredible Hulk there is absolutely no scene that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of a pile of superhero movies. Cartoonish CGI is an insult to audiences - at least in the Ang Lee version it seems to be trying to make it realistic (except for the poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> It's just like the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Hulk Ang Lee by making almost exactly the same movie. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton's success is that he seems to be giving up on this film.
