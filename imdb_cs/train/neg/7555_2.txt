Do not let it down - it was a fun movie. The problem - it was not a comedy. The story prepares you nicely for the end that never comes. Even worse, the NEVER setting is explained. You leave the theater and ask, "Is it so?" I only rate 2 because there were a few short promises but the end leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did the job he could expect, but he had little to do with it. There are special moods and interesting nooks everywhere that have nothing to do with the movie. Let this come out on the video before you lose money.
