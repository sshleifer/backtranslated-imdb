It is hard to believe that this is Henry Foola's sequel. It is hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, humorous, funny, Fay Grim is slow, boring and does not go anywhere. Where's the joke gone? I'm confused. It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Foola and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of actors who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the guilt lies solely in conspiracy, dialogue and even in some movies (low budget is not a justification). Great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I could not pay attention to the conspiracy, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you liked it, you do not have to enjoy Henry Foola ... nothing to do with others ... in personalities of personality is no connection ... it's all a scam that attracts fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I switch it now - Henry in some jail with the Taliban?!?!
