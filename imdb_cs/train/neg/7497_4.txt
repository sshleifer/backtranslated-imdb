After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding Spike Lee driving, I was thrilled to hear about this event. At that time I was not alive, I did not live in New York, so I waited more than a past lesson than anything else. What I got was some interesting acting, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of a movie that actually had something to do with Sam. I think the movie was not about Snoo Sam, but it was a look through the summer of '77. Mark me disappointment. <br /> <br />
