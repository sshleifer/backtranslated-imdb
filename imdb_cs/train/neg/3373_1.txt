I was lucky to see Chorus Line when he came to my town .. I was younger then .. but it was a great game .. so someone would tell me why they had to make a movie in the sky ... and why Michael Douglas ??? He did not play the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT to rent this movie .. Save your money for something better like "cats ...."
