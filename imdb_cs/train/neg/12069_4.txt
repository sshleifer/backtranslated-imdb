Film horror director Carl Monson was one of the most productive directors in the field of low-budget horror chaos. His films are full of awkward gore, ridiculous acting, boring parts and sad dialogue. A mysterious black cloak character brutally kills guests staying in a family home. Unfortunately, this film is almost bloodless. In fact, you do not see murders except shadows and several blood syringes. The tempo is lethargic, and the plot is rather uninteresting. competent, but the lack of gore and mutilation has let me down. Generous 4 out of 10. Just be careful: do not think of the same weak "Legacy of Blood" as Monson's film with Andy Milligan.
