This is a terrible little movie - and unfortunately, the company that did this short has done several others. Short is basically the thought of a joke that was not fun first and can also offend you. I was sure to worry when I watched very young children (most of them appeared about 2 years old) who are bothering to pretend to be adults - in this case, a dancehall girl and a patron of bars. It's such a humor that you might be forced to laugh at your own children if they pretended to be adults, but I do not see anyone who wants to see it - especially when the very young Shirley Temple is dressed in somewhat slick clothes and works like a vamp! And then other children behave like adults in some relatively mature situations. At that time I'm sure they did not try to reach out to pedophiles, but when we look at it today, that's what comes to mind immediately! Because of this I also robbed this boring movie and I hope I will never see it! Quite strange and quite horrible.
