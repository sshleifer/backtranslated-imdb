Bottom-of-the-Freddy Barrel. This is the worst movie in the series that defeated "Freddy's Revenge" for this title. Cheap looking (with average special effects), a disjointed mess, with Freddy turned into a punster. It has one or two cold lines, but this illogical and careless sequel will not save.
