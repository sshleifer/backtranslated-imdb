Where should I start? According to the title of this film, I expected some degree of authenticity, finally I was exonerated. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it's Hollywood (or you choose a movie hub) story freely based on some real lives. I had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent that gives an intro of the film in German; blood red text (title, artists) should be the second key. The story line is fanciful (Lale was not expelled from Switzerland by parents of Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle the Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded out of control NS mode is not under control, the tape recording in the station was raised in Vienna while Lieutenant etc.) Costumes are bad and incorrect for periods of time (SS black uniforms have always been used, from border guards to staff, everyday use, once the war has begun, etc.), characters are stereophonic types (SA bullies in the club, once were essentially out of power). Do not waste time.
