This film is probably an ugly attempt to justify Mary Ann Letourneau. To do so, they occupied the 19-year-old, probably not "to do it". There was no way they could be like a 12 or 13 year old boy because the love of the scene would make everyone out (if they were even allowed) - as they should. My girlfriend Mary Ann was the age of my nephew, who made her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of a pedophile may not include many children - everything you need is one thing. I really do not care about her upbringing or her unfortunate marriage. She had a responsibility to her students for not meeting her. The reason is that she is bipolar, refuses to diagnose, and refuses to take medication. So it is understandable that she did not understand rationally. Man now hopes he now understands his actions. When they marry Vili and have two children together, I pray that she is on her treatment and thinks clearly. <br /> <br /> All in all, Penelope Ann Miller was an absolutely convincing and perfect casting role.
