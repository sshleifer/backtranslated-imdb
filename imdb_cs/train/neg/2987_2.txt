The dubbing / translation in this movie is totally funny and provides the only fun in this otherwise boring and derived zombie. In my life I did not feel so much like watching Zombie 3 (and I've seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers have been able to adjust this movie again and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just funny. But ... If you fall out of your couch and laugh with the dubbing in Fulci zombie, it's not your cup of tea, then avoid all the money.
