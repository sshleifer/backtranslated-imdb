Good. So there are not really so many great movies there. Recent gems like American Dream, Direct Story, and even Toy Story 2 are not so close to coming. But the boy (!) This film balances the quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are financiers in this world so easily convinced that they will finance such a step ****? Now I see it now ... Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, it's as nice as a button and it was pretty good in Shakespeare in love and we got Rhys Ifans who is not cute but he was cool in Notting Hill. really mean score, a couple of forgotten post-Britpop melodies, hemlock root and brain lizard, and hey still have the worst film of the new millennium and believe me, it will be hard to do something as bad as it is in the next thousand years. I do not know what I mean, but I do not know what to do about it. "<br /> <br /> < Where do we sign? "<br /> <br /> Please.
