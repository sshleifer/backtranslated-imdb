Whoever ever wrote two or three shining reviews were either involved in making this film, the term used loosely, or the bank rolled in, and it should be the case, I would like to put my seven dollars back! Attractive actors who are freely used are terrible, in fact almost none of them have ever done anything, which is a relief. On scenery and on all those screams, we had $ 7 to work with and day to do it. Was it filmed in a former yard? Everything about this project says a low budget. The best actors were List D. Do not waste your time unless of course you want to take it back and try to borrow back. The bad guy looks like the 1970s punk that ended when he married his grandmother, dummee moore. My sales video market appears as the most visited movie with a sad commentary. Even with the 99 cents rental, this image collects dust. Someone really had to give some kindness. This is a super smell and I give him 10 debris.
