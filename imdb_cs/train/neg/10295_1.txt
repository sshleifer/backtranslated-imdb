There are a lot of talented people who pretend to be endowed with some beautiful meaning and that unconscious fools like me do not have that. Obviously it means we should stick to Hollywood dross. It has every artwork clich√© in it - I think it's good that the director is one of the chosen couple. Almost self-cuts drowned in their own will. The director of the film "Ratcatcher" (almost as embarrassing) returns with another piece hidden in artistic nonsense; is difficult to understand, and apparently it is a study of theft. The best way to describe this movie is to steal the audience.
