This movie is pretty boring. There are snaps of naked flesh that defend themselves in a lame attempt to keep the viewer up, but they fail. The best thing about the film is Lena Olinov√° - she does master work with her but Day-Lewis destroys most of his lines. Kaufman apparently had no idea how to shoot this. Discrepancies between domestic / marital issues and political crises are wrong. The character of attitudes changes without explanation throughout the text. Badly separated.
