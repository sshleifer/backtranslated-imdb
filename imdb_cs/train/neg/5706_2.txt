This movie is like the thousands of movies "cat and mouse" that preceded. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really only describes a great class of movies.) There is a passionate, wise major character, his furious but well meaningful assistant with misguided attempts at humorous comments, originally hostile but soon softened by a gorgeous lady that triggers the inevitable an "unlikely" love story, loved take hostages and, of course, careless evil adversary with their brutal minions. Everyone has already seen a ton of these films, and the "National Treasure" is like any of them, with a slightly modified cover. Every turn of the story was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in a shed). I'm quite tired of the fact that after I left the Hollywood movie theater, I felt utterly tired, and if you ever felt it, it also warned me; stay miles from this movie.
