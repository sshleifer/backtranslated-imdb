Mr. Perlman gives exceptional performance (as usual). It is sad that he has to deal with the signed script and some nonsense files. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in the "Die Hard" mode supplemented by singlet and convex muscles, I'm sure he could do better, but he seems satisfied (Erika) is very decorative (though fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" at the end of the event. <br /> <br /> SFX are mostly bad CGIs and steal from other movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
