As an informal Rolling Stones listener, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, because this movie is very "aged" in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s) it just looks like a hippie purist propaganda, but I'm sure this movie was not for me but for people who were active in the 1960s. I was expecting to have drugs with my friends, I was disappointed, in fact it was real life, hard work in the studio, so much that I felt like working with them to get to the conclusion of this godsome horrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I think they are watching a similar directorial style, a kind of "amateur" that made a feeling like the Eurotrash TV show, ill-directed, united and without real value of entertainment. My only good opinion about it is that I did not lose money on her, it's free on Sunday paper.
