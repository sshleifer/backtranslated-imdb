I refused to watch it when it originally broadcast and appreciated the memory of the late, lamented series of 1960s with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can not resist the challenge. I should have known better. It's not really a remake, and rather a parody than a tribute, this show did not even know how to play it, and full of children's comedies and cartoon parcels and characters. The three main characters were nothing more than a cartoon of actors and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in the role). Supporting casts were just the comic known Vic and Bobs who wanted to be part of the joke, and too aware of the situation to be convincing. And CGI, although the effects could not help to improve those available thirty years ago, only dazzled the viewer by the lights and the camera, and little masked the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and no fabric. (And since the 1960s proved to be ridiculous that there is a lot of time, this "update" is now also very dated, in the "Matrix" style, the mandatory scenes of "girl's power" and less than the gentle tension between the two live leads.)
