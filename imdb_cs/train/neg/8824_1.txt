What can be said about this movie differently than "watch out for yourself". Christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes because it was harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely dissatisfied with the "b" horror movement, but this film can not even scare a little for five years. The point of a nonsense fool who has thirst in the film is that he should look almost like a god, as if nothing could stop their maniacal rage, but in this film, a resident psychopath himself gets stuck in a chimney with a bizarre attempt to surprise his other victim, and of course along with all the popular legends of Santa Claus, reminds the viewer that this person is in no way dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. A totally unnecessary movie.
