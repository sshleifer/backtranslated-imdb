"Cat's Meow" features several scenes that boast intelligent conversation and some gorgeous performances, some of which surprise me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to excellent hair and makeup work from some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as writer Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (although movies never use her real life is hard to explain). But these elements do not contribute to a successful whole. The scriptwriter seems to have worked hard on certain scenarios - meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well done - but they are not that difficult on such a huge picture. A few small characters may not be there, and they do not follow consistently. The basic plot is full of illogical (eg Why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?) And party scenes are repetitive and tiring. I would like to think that the trip to Hearst's yacht is more fun than the film suggests. Davies is characterized as a standard bubble type Flapper that is not really accurate, and the screenplay of Chaplin and love is unlikely. <br /> <br /> Special, Bogdanovich, who seemed to be associated with thirty years in "Paper Moon," lacks similar kinship for the twenties. He insisted that excellent costume designers use only a black and cream color that gives visitors a very artificial look and plays only stereotypical songs from the period (eg "Yes, we do not have bananas"). When Hearst all insists on, "Charleston, Charleston!" the actors seem to have gone through a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can make fascinating films, I'm sure but not this time.
