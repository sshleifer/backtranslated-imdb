Oh, oh! Another gay movie. This time it's a black side. Bet on the last dollar to have an unfortunate end! But why? Only less than half a dozen exceptions, ALL homosexual films have to end with death or the final "adio". It's like all the European films Noir released in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The leader ... a man or a woman must die or go alone for oblivion. Why in the name of God do writers, directors and producers have the audience have the theater feel depressed? After all, it should be gay ... not ridicule. Perhaps this category should be changed to "sorrow". A big percentage of homosexual relationships lasts and couples go together to sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the underside of homosexual life and gives the wrong impression of homosexual lifestyle. This film proves my opinion. If you borrow a DVD, take an antidepressant, because there is another 'gay' movie! It is bad!
