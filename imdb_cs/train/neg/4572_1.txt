This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify absurd thoughts, limited by statements such as "we all create our own reality." <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, reality is what is true for all of us,. <br /> <br /> The idea that "whatever is possible" does not hold water on closer examination: if possible, it is possible, so it is possible and so nothing is possible. This leads to postmodernist nonsense, which is nothing more than an attempt to disparage the established truths so that all thoughts, justified and stupid, are the same. Citing science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who said so well: "Reality is what if you stop believing in it does not disappear."
