The film is an extraordinarily long story of a classic novel that does not fully capture the spirit of the original adventure. Pretty scary American Patrick Swayze is occupied as a British hero by Allan Quatermain, despite the apparent nationality. The film continues all the time to the "Hollywood-is" story by altering both plot and characters to fit comfortably into the accepted form. The film is thrilling around the world, even those who are not familiar with this story, and are plaguing some extremely bad gaming and terribly disappointed combat sequences. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a horrible, pretty, bad collection based on the legend of King Solomon and Allan Quatermain.
