I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people under the age of 5. I was used to this show when I was 4 and 5 years old, I was just looking at it when it was nothing. Now I'm another 5 and I'd rather do my homework than watch him. The cartoon was a bit funny, but it was not enough to make me laugh. Now I'm older I'm interested in an exhibition that is not going to evaluate us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things about Who, so I'm not interested in a 5 year old cartoon. This cartoon did not last long and had only 6 seasons, was canceled due to the low number of viewers, but some people say it was because the writers had ideas, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
