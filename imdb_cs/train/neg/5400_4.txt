It's just a short, full-blown gore fest based on the story of Stephen King. Two tabloid reporters, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so perfect (Julie Entwisle), are starting to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can really be a vampire. A strange stranger, this modern blood feeder is naturally not controlled, but thanks to black Cessna he is looking for his victims. Gore, in fact, becomes terrifying as the film approaches the stupid final. Keep in mind that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a bit frightening at night.
