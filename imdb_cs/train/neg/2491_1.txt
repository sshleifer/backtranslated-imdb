Maiden Voyage is just that. I would like to say immediately that I watched for five minutes before I just could not stand it. As already mentioned in the next note, this film does not fall into the whole thing "so bad it's good", it's just bad. The game is terrible, sfx is bad and the story is dull and stupid. Even suck sucks, "bag guy guards" and so they seem to hold their guns as a water gun. Do not even bother watching this movie, the only strange thing about it is that no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
