Williamson's accent is difficult to pass. He speaks incredibly quickly, as if he is quick to get over the lines. During soliloquies he behaves as if he was talking to someone when he should talk to himself. All this, and his bare place, made me uneasy. He was too old for this role. When reading further reports, Williamson may have been given this role because he was crazy and the director decided to make a bit of life - imitating - artistic or forced methods of negotiation. When actors say Hamlet is angry, you believe that! Marianne Faithful is a wonderful beauty and could disrupt the role of Ophelia and still gain a passage. The set is dark and foreboding, but it looks like it was shot in a real castle, especially scenes in tunnels / corridors, where the dead king shines like big light in the sky.
