In fact, it was pretty funny ... in "God, how the hell was filming this movie". if you make fun of movies ... I'm a little bit ... go ahead and watch it ... but if you really think "is it a good movie?" Draw this movie from the very beginning of the worst gaming scene I've ever seen in any movie ... usually get five minutes into it before you realize that "this movie could suck" .. but no, you know directly from the bat . this film talks about edgar allen poe ... never tried to explain it to people who did not remember the poe's life story ... so I do not know if there's anything that's been said, <br /> <br /> This film is about the writer "ethan poe" hookin with his cousin "Ann" .... they are both descendants of Edgar Allan poe ... or are they?!? seemingly, people are giving what their ancestors did. this guy, ethan poe, is actually a "usher" ethane who is to be descended from the story of "house of usher," written by edgar allen poe. Anne's brother sometimes tries to rape ... Ann is also at one point in the movie watched by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are just behind her as she looks at her and does not even know herself. who are murdered, will eventually appear and try to save the day ... but they can not, at the end, shoot Ethan as he tries to kill his best friend, of course, before he shoots him, he must scream "never more!" this film should be seen never!
