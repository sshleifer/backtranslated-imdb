WOW is all I can say if your reading is either being watched or thinking about it. trust me to look at it! <br /> <br /> So I laughed in so many parts of this movie. I can not believe they are superior to the school brand! I had to repeat this scene again and again to always laugh. If such a movie can happen, it gives us all the chance to make our own films. Even the costume was bad. it seemed that my seven year old cousin could do a better job. hell bet he could write and act better. all I know is that I have to watch the second part to see if it's as bad as the first. his great idea of ​​a murderous scarecrow, but it would be possible to do a much better job. Hopefully there will be another scary scary movie, just not like this one.
