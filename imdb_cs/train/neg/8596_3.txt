In fact, it's a pale shadow of High Fidelity, a humorous and gorgeously played film with some truly victorious, characteristic turns. Detective monitoring has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The premise of a video clip swept by a geek from a strange mysterious woman is good but never fully or adequately explored due to the very weak script and miskasting of the guides, not to mention the lack of a real visual story. I think this movie is centered around the movies, but it's incredibly uncinematic in itself! That's the main mistake there. But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters, because script and actors (Murphy and Liu) can not be true or compassionate realistic. The film thus becomes a series of episodes that include two people who seem to be, and that's not terribly interesting. Oh, yeah, one more thing: For a romantic comedy? Its not funny. And romance is not even horribly romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid it. Even at the 90-minute runtime it's just not worth sitting ...
