The life of the saints begins with the atmospheric vision of London as a busy city of busy, picturesque streets and sunshine. I was hoping to keep this atmosphere, but it is flooded with a story that is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the big, fat Mr. Karva, his criminal crocodile (at least I think that's what it's supposed to be because it's never defined, but it makes kittens into deep fats, so believe it's a prick) makes dirty little walks, while his girlfriends sketches give his father a hand job. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always dies from A to B. By the day he encounters a nearly helpless homeless child who gives him the wish to stop running. The Runner will exterminate a lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he immediately begins to make another wish. The King, who has to fulfill some of his own desires, has a kid kidnapped. But he is not sure what would bring him luck. Is it the innocence of being a child again, or is it another hand job? Either way, I do not want to see the little boy who gives him the other one. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of things to go, and there's a lot of repeating scenes. The end is trying to be shocking, but given that there is hardly any story of investing in any of these characters, it only serves as a release for the bored audience. Writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to unite in any religious allegory that ends up being hell-harder, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least better explanation for characters that were suddenly strange, then it would be a more enjoyable film. Just as we did, we introduced a lot of annoying loudmouths, who then look miraculous to develop intelligence when confronted with a mysterious boy. Whoever originates is never revealed. It's just irritating! <br /> <br /> In addition to the sporadic moments of the atmosphere and the moody score, this film has little recommendation.
