I have this movie with 3 skulls just because the girls knew how to scream, it could be a better movie if the actors were better, the twins were okay, I believed they were evil but the oldest and youngest brother, they really breathed badly, it seemed to read scripts instead of playing them ... spoiler: if they are vampires, why freeze blood? vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the movie says we drink it when it's alive ... but then, when they moved to another house, they got colder that the blood is frozen. the end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a huge waste of time, and it made me crazy to read all the reviews of how this movie was great, how many awards this movie won and this movie was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
