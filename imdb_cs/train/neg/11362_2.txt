"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated movie I've seen in LONG TIME. It says something I took my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years. The story is supposed to be a generous ... trite. The vote is horrible, too cute sounding. Humor is the Romper Room variety. The animation is suitable for a Nickolodeon cartoon, but it's a big screen, not a cable TV. Gets 2 just because it's ok 3-D visual. Some scenes have a slightly stimulating picture, but we have seen much better in the past. I also question the insistence of filmmakers that in most scenes the characters are flying away from the screen rather than from it. While it is interesting at first it became tiring after the 3rd or 4th time. The creators seemed indifferent to me. <br /> <br /> I would say it, it had a great soundtrack. And the record, even my son was not so crazy. Bad film.
