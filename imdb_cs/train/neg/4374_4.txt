<br /> <br /> The Valley of the Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, apply whatever meaning it wants, to its inexplicable sex exceses and violence. If it was a deliberate feature of the film, it would be a piece of postmodern brilliance - but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without getting too much information about the summary, check out the action. An orgy is taking place in a remote cottage, including a toy-free match and a diaper. Some faulty greetings join the orgies, but unconsciously follow the monsters I like to call the "mad ninja." This monster prevents the killing of orgy participants one by one, with the exception of the proverbial virgin (if you do not expect oral sex) to receive your seed and then become so passionate to masturbate with a separate hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, she has her courage pulled out and then there's a scene that seems to indicate she's pregnant with the baby's mud ninja. Do you have it all? If you want to rent this movie, it's best if you do not speak Japanese and you have no subtitles. In the season borne by boring Hollywood flicks, this introduction to a video recorder can be the film equivalent of shock therapy. There will be something else.
