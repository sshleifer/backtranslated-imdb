I caught this stinking bomb from the movie recently on a cable channel and I remembered how terribly I thought it was in 1980 when he was first released. Many reviewers are not old enough to remember the enormous humor surrounding this film and the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The overwhelmingly popular novel had legions of fans who wanted to see the presumed "master" director who screened this multilayered supernatural story on screen. "Salem's Lot" was destroyed in the late 1970s as a television mini-series that director Tobe Hooper (known as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") was badly treated and turned the main villain of the book into a "Chiller Theater" vampire with no real threat of destroying the whole assumption. Fans hoped the director of Kubrick's character would succeed where Hooper failed. It did not happen. Sure, this movie looks great and has an amazing startup sequence, but after all the successes it's all downhill. Jack Nicholson can not be anything but Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and he did not bring his role here. I do not care that many reviewers think it's all in this clinker, "Here's Johnny!" no matter how ... it's horrible in this movie. Like everyone else. Scott Crothers's character, Dick Halloran, was the basis of the book, but Kubrick kills him in one of the saddest "shock" sequences ever shot. I remember the audience in the theater I've seen in repeated booze in the last 45 minutes of this awkward move, those who stayed, that's ... many of them left. The royal books really never relate to the film, as so many stories appear internally to his characters and often metaphysically. Kubrick drove the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style, and the resulting mess ends up so far from the original material, which ultimately does not really care what happens to whom. This movie is still a smirk and why so many people think it's a horror masterpiece is behind me.
