This movie is bizarre. Better, it's "weird" weird. I could give you a summary of the plot or some shame analysis, but I would consider it a waste of time. Everyone who needs to know about this film is two young sisters, one incest, one murder, one death, one really worrying love. At the end of the movie, you feel like you have to shower to get the dirt washed, but not as well as "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club." It's like you're a teenager (or a college student that I'm a teenager myself) and I just did something you wished you did not do, and B: I hope the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never say about it does not know. And nobody likes it. I think rather than damaging your mind and watching a piece of unscrupulous film filth, just waste your time on something a little less terrible and look at "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather "Kazaam" than "Murder Virgin" what do you want).
