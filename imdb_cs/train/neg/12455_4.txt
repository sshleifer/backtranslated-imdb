I remember watching it at the main time when I was about 7 years old. I was a huge comic reader at the time, and everything about superheroes was hard to expect. However, the final result was humiliating. I knew about the stories of "Emma Peel" Diana Prince, because they recently ended and Diana was returned to her Amazonian shape. However, it was so little that I was bored for most of the movie. The ultimate costume was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. I saw the movie again in my late teen years. It did not improve much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more famous, making her incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had some good ideas, such as the crazy Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but he just did not meet and was still boring. I think they should put the story back better and put the show on the epic peak. It was too much of a restless film of espionage, a surpassed superhero told by someone who had never seen a comic book. The elements of the Amazons were interesting, but they had to be expanded. The film managed to force the producers to come back to the drawing board and come up with something more loyal if they were a bit too campy and a low budget. The budget was also very low and the superheroes are not cheap. It would be nice to have the film available on DVD, even as a comparative and historical documentary. Even Superman 4 is available and has nothing over this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing curiosity and some inspiration and caution for future versions.
