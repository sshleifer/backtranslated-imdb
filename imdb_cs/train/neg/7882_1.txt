After stopping in the movie shop to find something that could be watched, we found it. It looked attractive at least from this summary, so we tried it. And here is the kicker: the first 20 minutes is interesting! It's really nice! Wait, talk too early. Somewhere in the movie, the film was disgustingly transformed into basic, right-wing Christian brainwashing. It's not entirely certain what happens, but I think the scriptwriter found God there somewhere, he finished writing this script and did not have time to adjust it because he had a KKK meeting with his friends from Westboro and his hood was not cleaned. Can they give a warning? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just like video games have rating systems, movies need a symbol: maybe a small cross at the bottom corner to show us that the movie will go to the worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not share feelings about what happened to this story and have your Bible open in your lap when you follow it and plan to turn your neighbors, do not waste your time. These are some of the worst waste that have been going on for a long time, and radical religious do not necessarily need funding.
