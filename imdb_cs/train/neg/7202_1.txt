Since I loved the cartoon Inspector Gadget in the 1980s, I went to see this movie. I spent the money. The conspiracy was very thin. Also, the movie could not be of interest to me for a long time. I was glad it was over. If you want to see the Inspector Gadget, check out the place. It was much better than a movie.
