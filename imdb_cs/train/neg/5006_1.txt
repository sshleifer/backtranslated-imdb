Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike each other that they despise but have little or no redemption to * the audience * resemble or empathize with one of the characters. There are movies so bad that they are good (and la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and there is simply bad (as 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is hardly acceptable, even if you are an outstanding talented MSTie rival (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, when I'm rather talented (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into * this * movie, you just want to pull your own head, painfully you realize that Taboo will poison you about an hour and twenty minutes before you ever return. Even my MSTie talents were hardly a match for this slow, boring, boring waste of time. The most interesting aspect of this movie is that * some * grew up and / or financed it ... I rented Taboo exclusively for the normally gifted Amber Benson, who apparently had to be blackmailed into the movie. I have another less known movie on my rental list, reviews I should read first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine lock for its inner location.
