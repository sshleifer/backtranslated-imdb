This is not entirely original. If anyone saw "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. The rich family in Rome lives everyday life that is boring and fake, and they all ask others what they think about them. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story ends. That's because it's easy to see a moralistic view of Muccina in this movie, so even the toughest parts seem normal. A summary in the first 2 minutes of the movie would be enough and the aim of the film was already said. the family has been seeing the family for 30 years, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show reality, but to be in line with his ideas, he has to push more than a normal situation. Really good as Muccino puts the camera in the right place, moving with a karaorme, and that's the only reason why I do not let me sleep in the cinema, though always in the movie, screaming from the beginning. Perhaps it might be good to see the family as they really are and not blame for anything. Morante was intense and great as usual, but unfortunate for the bad movie!
