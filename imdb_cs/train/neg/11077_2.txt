The only reason I decided to shoot this was due to the presence of the Oscar-winner Ernest Borgnini. All I can say was that it was the biggest loss of a good actor ever shot. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so united, and I am impressed that the studio actually paid "artists" to appear. Pair this level of talent in the acting department with a story so fertile and insignificant that I thought my eyes would bleed at a time when credits grew and you had a perfect cinematic catastrophe. The film was obviously filmed to appeal to children's audiences and was better than most of the original programming on Disney Channel and similar child-directed networks. But honestly, it does not say much.
