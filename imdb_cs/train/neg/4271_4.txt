A typical thriller, many times. Simple outline of the drawing; the cop, Liotta, becomes obsessed with Russell's wife and tries to break the good Kurt to have it. That's exactly predictable, you do not even try to guess, the conspiracy is a conspiracy, and there's no idea out there. I think the only reason to look at it is to see how it evolves, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There is nothing to say about this film, it's nothing wrong, but no good points. Russell plays Russell and you know what you get when you see him in the movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an unpleasant Cher-esque voice. I read the outline of the plot and saw the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it, and it seemed to me that it was exactly the way I imagined. I did not feel like a drop of emotion. I have no feeling for this movie, it's like I've never seen it. Because it's a pretty insignificant film, is not it? Still, for some reason I'll give it 3/10.
