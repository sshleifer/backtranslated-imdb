The film started strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a secret police officer with a partner Sgt. Lazer (Dylan McDermott of Practice, perhaps miscast as a bad guy?) To commit robbery and murder. Crime refuses to kill a drug dealer that causes a dirty police officer's conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey, etc.) are well occupied and the movie promises. The film starts to fall as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the possibility of making a good movie that people will see repeatedly, or the fact that teenage girls will go and see once for Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard on their craft; Timberlake is not talented, and no hard work can save him. I would think that he would be able to take a better show because he was years of talent. Everything he did in this film was not convincing. Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums does not automatically mean they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans can not ignore the apparent lack of acting talent. In addition, there are a couple of holes, such as the sudden ability of Pollack snipers and the lethal operation of the tracking machines. This film had so many promises. Completely disappointing.
