I loved the first season. The quality fell slightly in the second season, but it had a great center (Pegasus!). The third season was fairly new and original and was ok. The fourth season has begun to decline rapidly because it has never begun to explain when we really needed it. What the hell was Cylon's plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the reason Angel-Kara, who led the fleet to the destroyed Earth 1? What past have the last five Cylons, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnated? Questions everywhere, it does not answer anywhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Good. But destroy the fleet? Get rid of the technology and give up any kind of urban life and enlarge a few thousand people by paper all over the planet! It's not just anti-science, it's anti-rational and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then appears that humanity is forever captured in a cycle from the romance of nature to the decadent capitalist society that invented the destructive A.I. it destroys everything. It is visionless, without hope for a great future for humanity and is opposed to proper science fiction. And do not even start me on the angels! Religious scream of the worst kind! Final disappointment! The whole of "this all happened before and it happens again" should relate to the previous incarnation of the series, not just the Earth, as we know it. Making a new show a bit consistent with the old would be a definitive brain genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
