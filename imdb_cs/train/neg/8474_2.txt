The opening scenes move as smoothly as the frozen velvet. An attempt at a dramatic dialogue only wishes me to have better control over it in advance. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or harrowing disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. Usually, the body counts, so there was a cat (which does not count) a bum, a girl who fell from the sky with the sword in it (whatever it was) and then a conspiracy. Foley artists are respected using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but with the sound of biting into the apple for the vampire bite victim is simply stupid. I like Warlock, but this movie was just so disturbed that we turned it off and it was so forgotten that we rented it a year later to shut it down again.
