When I did not read a novel I can not tell how this movie is true. The story is a typical mysterious material: the murderer focuses on newlyweds; a female investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it works. The first two thirds are boring, with the exception of murders, and the last 1/3 causes a partial return because it increases speed towards the insidious conclusion. Efficiency is strictly subordinate, though it's hard to blame the actors themselves: the script is cruel. During the last 1/3 you will notice it, because the movie is really interesting, but it is only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very strong, but he has just enough to do with TV budget and censorship on the back. It is largely limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses, although he managed to rest in several pairs under the floor during the murders in the clubhouse. Unfortunately, because this is for television, cool compositional details that are so well-used with a wider picture are not found anywhere. Note for Producers: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him. <br /> <br /> Summary: This movie is bad according to cinematographic standards and average according to TV standards (CSI watch, instead). If you have such a mood, I have some great suggestions: pick up a copy of "Deep Red" by Daria Argenta (my highest recommendation, excellent movie), "Opera" or even "Tenebre". In each category, they are stronger.
