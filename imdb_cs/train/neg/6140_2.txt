This movie is cheerful. The problem is, it's not a comedy. One classical scene involves Kurt Thomas, who is just finding horses in the middle of the village square (used to forgive evil guys.) Another is a trek to the "village of Crazies". It is a shame that this film was not considered a farce, or he managed to get better ratings.
