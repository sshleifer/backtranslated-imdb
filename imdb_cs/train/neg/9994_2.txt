Hmmm, the sport team is in an air crash, entangled in a snowy mountain and faces a difficult decision to eat the meat of their dead companions to survive. Does anybody know that? I mean "Alive" since 1993. The only major difference is, of course, that the big, white, drunken crow Yeti appears several times to pull the dead. I think people want better than yaks. Stupid: A man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The air crash is totally fake. It could either explode in the air, explode when they hit the ground or destroy. People would survive, but hey, it's science fiction. Fools: They survived and are cold. It could be a good idea to use some of the burning dirt around to avoid freezing. The fire is warm as it is ... WTF: The pilot has a frost formed all over his face while he is alive and talking but weird, no one else. <br /> <br /> Silly: One of the boys tells others to search for matches and lighters, but they are scattered parts of the ON FIRE all around them. Stupid: They find coats and sweatshirts, yet there in the cold Himalayas, do not use the hood! <br /> <br /> Fools: They are looking at a pile of sticks when, I repeat, there are pieces of aircraft that are already BURNING <br /> <br /> Fools: The Himalayas are renowned for their storms. It would be sensible for them to gather debris to strengthen their structure rather than sit outside. There are plenty of pine trees whose branches are excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: If you have any doubts, use the dead man's shoulder as a palm. <br /> <br /> WTF: If you know so much about the hibernating habits of the vever, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, then why does not he know enough to provide shelter and set traps right from the start? <br /> <br /> Silly: When trying to capture wild animals, a helpless conversation around the trap will always help. WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight Yeti, while the other two stood defenseless. Yeti pulled the guy's heart and turned the girl's head and the gang did nothing. There is love. So two Yetis and a comfortable avalanche that can forever conceal the evidence ... or we think so. Mwuhahahaa! The story goes into a bigger idiot, but most of the action takes place in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Nice thinking with a spear and string, though it is some ingenuity (with a magically emerging string) that they lacked at the beginning of the film when they could not even create a fire despite being around them. <br /> <br /> As is typical for sci-fi originals, a loving couple kisses at the end as if nothing terrible happened to them (not to mention that they ate the human body and did not have teeth after a few days). <br /> <br /> The end itself is an emotional lame.
