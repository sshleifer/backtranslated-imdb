I will have to disagree with the previous comment and next to Maltin. It is the second, ominously outsider, thirsty and thirsty, trying to overcome its central theme of the wild west, to curse and kick out aside the constant march of time. It would be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but it lacks the magical and magical movie. Andrew McLaglen is fine and the last 30 minutes is a real boot, with some incomprehensible strategy from the heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Somebody tell me why they lit the slope.) There was something not to worry about the treatment of rape scene, and the woman's reaction was certainly not right. Coburn is very unpleasant because half of the breed escaped convicted to revenge, but all of his fellow refugees are underdeveloped (they are like bowling pins to be knocked one after another as the story hides in front). Michael Parks gives one of his typically lethal, lethargic, mockery performances, but in this case it is appropriate because his modern-day sheriff symbolizes the satisfaction that technological advancement can bring.
