One must be interested in whether there is any script that makes sense at any time to produce this movie. Was the rough cut 3 hours long and cut into a discontinuous mess that survived? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone fund this mess? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good-looking young man doing what he can do with the dialogue and the dramatic (?) Situations that are given to him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate selection of the title as it may be untrue if someone really tries to really watch this movie.
