There is a scene near the beginning after the shootout where the horse runs. If something red appears on your eye, it's because a white van is parked behind the path. I thought I saw the bad, but it is. White delivery in the western part. Did not they understand this? Okay, and I paid the peak for the rent. It will want to grab your friends and let them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. Speaking was so slow that acting was mostly fine but could not be taken seriously due to the bad nature of shooting. There is a door for the sheriffs who today look like a door with a special trim. I say I'm watching this movie and moving Boy to second place in the worst time.
