If I did not read "Union Street" from Patrick Barker before I saw this movie, I would like to. Unfortunately, this is not true. It's actually my kind of film, it's well made, and I do not want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation it's missing from every angle. A godly novel about reality living in the Northern England of the Workers' Area grabbed my heart and refused to let go a few weeks after I finished. While reading about Union Street women I received tears, resentment, shock, anger, compassion, and misery. Excellent. A novel I sometimes felt I could not read anymore, but a novel I just could not suppress. Compression yes, but absolutely grip. Film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and made it a layer of sweet sugar on the top. Beautiful movie, inspiring soundtrack, great performance, story of hope and romance ... yes. Adaptation of "Union Street" ... no. Union Street women and their stories are truncated in the character of the Funds, their stories are affected, but many are discarded. I admit that some of Barker's stories are sensitive and too horrible for mass surveillance, and that the film with about 7 major protagonists is simply not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and real rhythm of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically depicted smell of poverty is replaced by the sun, nice houses and flashing William's score. <br /> <br /> If you liked the film because of its positivity and hope in the face of "reality," I suggest you hesitate to read the book without first preparing for something similar to "Schindler's Leaf". but without a happy ending.
