apart from the fact that there are crazy people and there are religious nuts. <br /> <br /> The characters do not really make sense most of the time. The film has no real beginning, even nothing is explained. The film begins with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently coming back from the army. <br /> <br /> He gets a ride to a two-storey house that is in an extreme crash, the windows are changed. He went into the house, walked around, and finally wrote a note that he would leave. This scene is useless and we learn about the house or its history. It is never explained exactly who the house is or where people have left, but we feel that Hazel is probably living there at one time. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to town. Why - we do not know. As soon as he arrives in this city, he writes the name and address he sees on the bathroom wall and visits the woman who is a surprisingly fat foal. She sees her for a moment, and then she probably does not see her anymore. Just like everything else in this movie is useless and has no point. A young man named Enoch is trying to get in touch with him, but Hazel really does not care, even though they keep crossroads. <br /> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are talking about them offensive. We never know why Enoch behaves like him or why Hazel behaves as he does, for Hazel was overwhelmed by an old, haunted fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. Enoch later finds himself in the eye with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get a gorilla suit off him and then runs around. <br /> <br /> Hazel, which is injured relatively tightly and seems to be in constant border rage, does a little street sermon. I had the impression that he was trying to free himself from the untruth of the religion enforced. He has several encounters with the preacher and his daughter, though their interaction never really makes any special point and there is no plot of plot. Eventually Hazel is subject to total religious enthusiasm and begins to self-harm. <br /> <br /> This is a very special movie. Interesting is his peculiarity, but besides not doing absolutely anything. <br /> <br /> Casting does an excellent job, but this film is completely unable to deliver either a glance or a plot. <Br /> <br /> <br /> The film also has characters that are bouncing around the word N from time to time without being linked to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
