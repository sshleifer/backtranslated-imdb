Beautifully photographed and abilly act, in general, but writing is very slipshod. There are scenes with such incredible that there is no joy when watching. The fact that a young lover, for example, has a twin, is so invented that I moaned loudly. And the "emotional-bulb connection" also seems to be handy. <br /> <br /> I do not know, however. If you have a couple of glasses of wine and you feel like you have some nice things to look at with a few comic scenes, it's a pretty good movie. There is no need for great effort on the part of the viewer. Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this one.
