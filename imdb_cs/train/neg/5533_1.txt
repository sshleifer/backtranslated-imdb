Before the release of the genre film The Night of the Dead by George Romer, zombies were relatively well-groomed creatures. In ancient times, they definitely had a much better table. But the social label aside what excites these early zombies offer the movie audience? This story relates to an expedition to Cambodia, the aim of which is to find and destroy the secrets of zombies. One side discovers the mystery itself and prepares to build its zombie army. This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But when we see it as a 30s movie, these zombies are more like somnambulists than the various meats that we think of today. They seem to react to mind control, rather than to greedy tastes. And frankly, "rebellion" is somewhat irritated. The whole thing is really boring. Besides the lack of horror, there is no melodramatic theme that would entertain us. It seems unlikely that it could provide much fun even 70 years ago. Find out if you have to see everything with 'zombies' in the title, but otherwise I would recommend that you skip this mistake.
