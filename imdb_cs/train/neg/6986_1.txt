I can not make Al Pacino out. I look at him in Knitch, Scarface, Carlit's Way, and I think I'm watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in two for money, for any Sunday and revolution, and I wonder what the guy thinks. For a few days I came across a revolution, and I thought I'd invest another two hours to do it. Here's the news flash: Do you want prisoners to talk? Arm them to watch it over and over ... They'll admit anything. <br /> <br /> I will not plot a conspiracy because there is no continuous conspiracy, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to engage, but eventually does. While she has no money, no education and clothing as a cave man, very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no obvious reason because they have only two minutes of dialogue together. <br /> <br /> Quite frankly, if "Al Smith" played in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino", it would destroy their career. The script was terrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious false accent still made it worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was ridiculous. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character but has 5 lines in the film. In fact, no one in the movie talks much. One of the saddest predictions in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this strange talent to keep on struggling on the battlefield. Her as a whole northeast is Starbucks. "Hey, fun to see here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... I'll see you in a few months." I have to give this star IMDb because there is nothing here for a negative score.
