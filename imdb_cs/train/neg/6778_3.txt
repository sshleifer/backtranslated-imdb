Oh dear, dear ... For fans of JM it was a nail in a coffin as to her career in Hollywood. After a solid turn in the Girl Can not Help, Wayward Bus, Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed that Jayne was on the way to become one of the hottest stars of Tinsel Town. However, obsession with hostile publicity and appearance in this clunker pushed Mansfield off to the marginal, and cheap flat rates of the Euro until Fox could cut the contract with the fastest opportunity. This film is a really devilish waste of time for all, except for Suzy Parker, who is the only thing in this movie that is bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her graying performance for the wrong return of this film in the box office, and while the pain in this movie is, she can only do the best with this material. After all, Cary barely sets the screen to fire, right? With a bunch of very good dramatic and comedic turns, Jayne takes 10 steps back in her search as a serious actress by agreeing (just to appear with Grant) to portray this shy, idiotic threat. Her character, Alice, is a complete bimbo cartoon, and although she looks good to go out in a cosmetic suit, her everyday appearance in the film circulates her nerves. We all know that Jayne could do much better than this stain, and still looks like a custard. Real damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this so-called Comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
