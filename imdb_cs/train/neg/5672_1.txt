I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most important factor in DVD ownership is a short movie in bonus items. My voice for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Do not understand, it's a terrifying girl. but I want the meat to be behind the story, not to mention that it is preferable for evil to become a people not to be deceived to look what seemed forever clips of animal snake. The acts of brutality interrupt painful long silence and misconduct. If I had to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to my mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, dull, useless and uncomfortable watches.
