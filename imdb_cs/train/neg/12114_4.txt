Special people living in the city walk for their lives. It's a lollipop of a fellow who licked everything, a diving diver who finds the body he took home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to cleanse girls from their wrong ways ... outside in an extreme the case is better in color in black and white. The black & white image is two steps away from a home movie. Just like the movie Troma, this movie is fun in bouts and starts, but it's usually weird for the audience and it will soon become an accident because one sees setting, you can certainly guess where its a lot of time - not always - but enough to make it it was not fun. (Though I did not see the purging come). It's worth it if you have nothing else to watch, and you're waiting for another set of Golden Girls from Netflix.
