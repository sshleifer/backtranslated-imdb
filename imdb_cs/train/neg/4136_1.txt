I read reviews before I watched this movie, and I did not trust them. I like bullshit movies and I expected it to be average. It was not. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 as big. The film contains bad acting, bad sound, bad confused story, bad makeup - and that bored me so much that I turned it off. Nudity was rubbish! Did he even have the budget for this movie? I do not think so. You can see if you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want to watch a toxic revenger 4 or even a blood camp at a good bloody bloody movie. Avoid these garbage - I watched them on TV and I felt them lost, so do not play anything. The best part is probably the end.
