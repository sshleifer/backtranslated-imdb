Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredible pair of screens from John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction goes uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein surely thinks it's a former, and his self-centered performance in a minor role underlines the complete lack of balance and chemistry among filmmakers. Normally I do not like it to be such that it is unbearable, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books and watching what they do is literally crazy.
