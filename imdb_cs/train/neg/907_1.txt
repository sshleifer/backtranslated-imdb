I wrote a review of this movie further after I bought it on DVD and I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to track it again after reading a few comments since then. Being a student of the film and creating similarly budgeted films myself (ie No budget, made on digi cam), I stand behind my original remarks. This is no student project (and not particularly good) that goes on video / dvd to look like the award-winning film (if you read the cover). So cheating the public into thinking that it is not something that is not. I want my money back under the business description of the law! Complete garbage!
