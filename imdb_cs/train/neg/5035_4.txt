Melissa has her sixteenth birthday just around the corner, and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turned out that all the boys who spent time with all the winds who were murdered in this generic 80th slasher movie. This is the local sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his unpleasant mysterious loving good daughter with two boots, Marci (Dana Kimmell, fifth 13th volume 3), got to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film and less on the killing itself, so it can distinguish itself from many of its 80th Slater brothers. It will not hurt that Alesia has a large body (I feel the need to emphasize that it is clear that the actress is over 18 years old, so they say I'm not too perverse). Conversely, the film is slowed down by several points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, some of which are often used on a grid and an end that is counter-climatic. But good predominates bad (barely). Give this rent, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Shows: Aleisa Shirley shows her breasts, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My degree: C <br /> <br /> </ div> <div class = Red Red Extras Code: Star Aleise Shirley Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both directors drew a theatrical version of the film; Sound interviews with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still a gallery; a theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
