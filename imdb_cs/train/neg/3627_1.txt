I never have much for classical movies. Movies like Patton, My Way, How Green Was My Valley, Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane. However, I would like to watch one of these films 3 469 times when I was tied to a chair than an American watch in Paris once in the most luxurious suite at all. If I did, I would probably have slept all the time. Colored artistic direction and music I did not care about, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dance and singing could sleep insomnia. Dialog does not match Singin in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie I've slept while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I slept only 5 minutes at night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Damn that we can not give zero.)
