Some family parody mix, "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and undoubtedly other films I can not remember) can be found in a somewhat boring film with several bright spots. Gags are always where you'd expect them, and Damon Wayans' lines are well predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie will never surprise you ...
