I want to do "Holmes with the door", but I can not put it all together. Appropriately harsh and modified WONDERLAND gives the Kilmer role that Morrison is broadcasting at the same time .... but how is this movie about the famous 14 inches! Australian Crime Films Still Bouncing And Jumping Violence ... ... as someone famous said once about American films double standards: "kiss breasts and it's X, stabbing and its action PG 13" .. WONDERLAND is too long 14 minutes and at the end of a dirty spiral, we were all glad to have escaped from the cinema. How many films are named WONDERLAND that we are about to get? There have to be six in the last ten years. Pixilized violence and muted color create a tense tone, but the wavy camera becomes tedious as if we were still looking at our nostrils. Some suggestions from DOORS and TAXI DRIVER will become forgotten the next day.
