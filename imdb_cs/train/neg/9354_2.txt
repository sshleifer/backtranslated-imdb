The key aspect of the film is that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the ability to tell the story by showing it to him. You do not have to tell the audience what they think, because they will see it. The action here is scattered by some of the most serious narratives unleashed to the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former. And that should be unnecessary because there are fine casts and some beautifully composed and eccentric visuals. Perhaps Jobbo felt the basic story needed illuminated support. And he could be right, lacking basic credibility: The Edinburgh 70s were not exactly full of beautiful brains who were interested in Velvet Underground and a soft space for a passing sociopath. From a very neat and new looking garment that carries the character of creative intellectualism that tries to bring everything together, it is for my taste.
