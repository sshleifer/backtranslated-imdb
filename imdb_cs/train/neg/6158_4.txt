Once in the mid-1990s I wrote for DOCTOR WHO fans and the whole fan kept on breathing about the new American production DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that Eric Roberts would be the doctor's arch enemy, everyone scratched his head and screamed, "Who is Eric Roberts?" I should point out that it was before the IMDB got to the Internet when all you had to do was write the names on these pages on their resume, but one helpful soul wrote in the publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for his role as F Murray Abraham, a film called Sword and concerned the fencing school. In fact, I look back, Roberts is best known for POPE GREENWICHHO VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but it did not stop the man who put the shoes on both Roberts and SWORD and his mind was created so that this American master with his southern draw was going to debacle . Unfortunately, most fans rumored that Roberts was playing with the Master, but after seeing DOCTOR WHO TVM, many fans (I among them) thought Roberts' performance was the best thing about unsatisfactory American production. Yeah I'm a diversion, but SWORD was a movie I wanted to see simply because I first heard Eric Roberts's name, but until this weekend I did not have a chance to see and I was quite disappointed. I do not know anything about fencing (everyone else on this page has to mention whether they are floating or not, I do not have fences), so I do not know exactly how that is all, but as I mentioned, the movie feels a bit anachronous even though you've seen it when it was released in 1991, hairstyles look a few years obsolete along with a mixed teenage actor doing a little dance routine that asks you if it would not be much better if it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid-eighties. You could say that this would mean that the relationship between Max Sub and Alexander Villard is out of the center for most of the film but I was not convinced of their relationship of love and hatred, and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performances earlier and since then
