It's a bad movie, but I have to give an acting actress ... Francine Forbes. She seemed to be the smallest, and I personally thought she was a little cute. It is a shame that it appears only in one other movie in the database. In addition, the film is full of ridiculous ghosts and fake death scenes. People are stabbing and GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you want to watch bad horror films, I recommend this very much.
