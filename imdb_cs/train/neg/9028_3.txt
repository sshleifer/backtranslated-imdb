I have just watched this movie and I must say that Turkey is so precious and with great talent! My friend borrowed this movie and watched with an open mind mainly because the story was so much praise. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot who left ... why? Why are they doing a fighter? He assumed that he would be Anthony Quinn's personality to become his new pilot ... Well, we never see that Costner would fly near the plane with the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner encounters Texana (James Gammon), who sells the horse to a great Mexican trader, and Costner sets out for a ride. Without knowing what has happened, Gammon is almost killed by death, and Costner leads him to a meeting that will happen to Quinn! But none of this is ... fun, alright! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why did they have a horse sales with a Quinn partner, if that was not the case? <br /> <br /> Also, after leaving Costner for the dead, Madeline Stowe's figure will be courageous, then he attacks one of Quinn's men who paid for the turn ... she is kicking him with his own knife, and another thing that she was moved to the monastery! No explanation why she was relocated or when it was done! Too much talent wasting on such a poor scenario and bad editing !! I watched it just because my friend owned me and let me watch ... I'm going to throw it for two hours, and I've been watching my life unnecessarily as it happened!
