My comment relates to the Russian version of Space Battle (Battle for the Universe), which was listed on Russia's first channel from April 10 to April 13, 2006. The poor translation could destroy some details, but I doubt it is so . The number of factual errors is such that they can not be listed, especially in the first episode (the development of the first missiles). Even half of the US film contains several mistakes and omissions. The audience is not aware of any US V-2 / A-4 launch. There are three different Jupiter C missiles on board with the same serial number UE. Apollo 1 is to be shown on the Moon, etc. In the Russian half everyone is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, etc. Men as a function; no motivation, no life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song waiting for the start (I think it has been added especially for the Russian version).
