with this attempt by the ABC family to hit a blockbuster "cheaper than a dozen," an unpleasant amount of ominous dialogue, shallow conspiracy lines, and return cheese will come. With about two good actors among the many who wanted to be, this movie was the main disappointment. It's a Hollywood demon out of a bad plot. Then, because they needed a bunch of actors, it meant they would probably be milder. So, acting was not five stars. The conspiracy moved relatively quickly, and the twists were bad and had a terrible timing. The intersection of characters and "end relationships" was too fragile for me and clich√©. Replace and rent something better.
