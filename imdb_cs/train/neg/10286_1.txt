Fellowship Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by horrible guys as they buy and take a day off to a remote island that girls are reluctant to tell the criminals they last visited when they were ten years old and that their wealth is. Everything that mostly covers the film is a lot of long glimpse of the first-time girls on the island and the subsequent struggle with the cannibalistic family. This is extremely immeasurably affected by all concerned that I felt bad about poor Hank Worden, who really deserved much better. Just as I did not like "Barracuda" (it's on the same DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. Eye Candy: One pair of boobs (they can belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Class: Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage commercials for various drive-in meals; and stories for "Bonnie's Kids", "Centerfold Girls," "Part-time Wife", "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive." The DVD also comes from the 1978 "Barracuda"
