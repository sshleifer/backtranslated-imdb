The extremely thin "conspiracy" of Satanic rituals or some such "mumbo-jumbo" provides a hokey excuse to contain a lot of sexual scenes together. Direct vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest, and several other sexual proliferations will come to our attention. The problem is that the storyline is so boring that, after an accident, embarrassing sexuality gets quite lengthy. Who knew the movie with a confidential goat / girl engagement might be so damn boring? Now I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both are on display quite often); Teenage girls sometimes get a penis. <br /> <br /> My tricks: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: Trailer for "Pick Up", "The Legend of the Eight Samurai", "No Answer the Phone", "Prime Evil "and" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD contains the second feature film" Evil Eye ")
