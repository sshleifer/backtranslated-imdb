...... this movie is pretty awful, the only thing that stopped me to give him a rating of 1 was the fact that I unfortunately got worse. Jungle music, juttering demons, and fluorescence blood / teeth / ultraviolet radiation give you a "terrible" look and the script is terrible ..... this movie is more like a test that will show you how long you can last you're giving up. It's also predictable, but not good. Nothing that does this movie is good. I was looking at it ten minutes ago, and I thought I'd be a little jerk, so you're there. (oh and acting does not leave the film down, it's also terrible)
