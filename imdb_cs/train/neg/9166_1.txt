Recherche is a good word for describing this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say every movie has a sales point, a trick. Transformers' trick is an amazing effect, just like a fan of nostalgia boys. The hopeless trick in Seattle is in their tagline: "What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many novels rely heavily on these tricks and some thanks to the big names draw. Leap Years employs both the use of Irish folklore as a circumstance and to represent the most famous names in the country. <br /> <br /> So now that the audience is in the cinema, besides all the usual elements in characters, conflicts or consequences, crisis, determination and revelation, they also look forward to instilling dialogue, absorbing situations due to transient years, partial drawings and perhaps to some extent a good twist in the middle or at the end of a story that prefers the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean Yeo is trying to achieve. If they tried, their target was obviously in the second court, at the second stadium, at the other end of the planet. She and her writer Alain Layrac did not provide a stimulating dialogue.

"The result is cathartic, I can not say that the lines are useless and have no relation to the story or to the plot, but they seem to go out of the way to capture you with these quoteable quotations. <br /> < On the personal level, I know people who quote citations based on most of the situations in our dialogue, they try to think by themselves when they nod, I'm no longer going with them because the desire for them is stunning. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the figures displayed are stupid and one-dimensional, except for the unnatural dialogue that implies their motivation (needed to control the plot), there was no sense of conviction, I have no idea who they are, all of the simple tough lines from the post <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Three times in jump years is not enough to drive the story because the circumstances are too shallow, then again there are movies with less, but Better than this, they are not there, they developed it with my first and second points, and the sub-areas are insignificant (not that bad for movies) and thin (bad thing). Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to postpone a terrible plot of land with fantastic places and passable photographs. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get approval from some viewers than others with a good use of cinematography, soundtrack and film placement.
