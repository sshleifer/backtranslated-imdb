METAMORPHOSIS I work in the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORFOSA seems to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire," which also featured scientists seeking similar results. In modern times METAMORPHSIS is not my horror film. The university researcher is working to crack the human genome to create serum that prevents aging. Pressed by the administration to publish its documents; and produce some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use it as a guinea pig! At first, he thought he had no undesirable side effects, and eventually find out that the serum really changed him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> Acting is stoned; and the performances left me much less interested in the movie. The score is irritated. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not just a delusion; that is absurd; It is ridiculous ?? at best. <br /> <br /> As others commented, the end turns to 30 minutes or more, which is seemingly endless. Without doing too much, I would call this one: "Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde will meet the Black Lagoon game.
