This absurd film offers the standard "hippie mentality" of the 1970s in nut shell and makes us in the process. Her attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with older sexual fantasies and washing. The naive young hippie who plays the wandering (Kay Lenz) and sleeps with all the bad boys, and then one day meets with laughs (Holden) already in old age, drinking alcohol and emptied as an actor, and she decides she is in "love" with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. He still says how much he loves him, and she only met him that she is thin and really fast. I could not help but laugh around the movie. Apparently, he is just using it as a menu, but the director is still immature to think that we are going to buy, that there really is love. The disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I had to move it forward because it almost inspired me to vomit. The film is also broadcasting a crazy offer of music from the 70s. Avoid it if you can. Step D.
