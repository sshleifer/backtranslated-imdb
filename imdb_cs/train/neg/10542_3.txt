Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem. Serial killer Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom he helped save the mental extravagant Tess (Tracy Griffith), was resurrected by the first power (Satan had given him after his execution in the gas chamber) and could have the bodies of the weak. Somehow Russell, who joins forces with Tess (who has an understanding of what is against them) will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in bloody hands. They seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic Church's First Force but was denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing ... and a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing releases the world your evil. It will come in the same way and help hand Russell, who needs all the help he can get when Channing throws Tess preparing her for a satanic ritual / ceremony. In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a renowned guest actor, gets Russell's partner ... you know what's going to happen to him. As with movies of this type, everyone around Russell dies, but when he tries to kill Channing, he just kills the weak host of another poor soul he has. goal gate. Phillips and Griffith are trying, I'll give them, but they do not have a chance like this. A cobweb, which is usually always as effective as heavy, is actually served only as an enemy that jumps in the air and throws up spoiled spells.
