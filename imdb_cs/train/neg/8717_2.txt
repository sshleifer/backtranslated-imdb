This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. I was looking at a DVD with a friend on Friday night and we just could not stop laughing from the beginning of the finish. The story is pretty simple: the terrorists are hijacking a convoy that they think they wear uranium weapons, but they actually carry a bunch of people who are driving dinosaurs. Easy error. Cue's surprisingly incompetent army special forces team to deal with prehistoric animals. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the acting "Smell the Fart," as Joey advocates in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of blood and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately the Rance team has a problem with focusing their weapon in the general direction of the hordes of giant, carving monsters. It also seems that the lights always flash and go out whenever Velociraptor attacks (probably to see how bad beings are). <br /> <br /> When it all said, everyone had a lot of fun betting on who's going to get their head bitter next. <br /> <br /> As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure, this movie smells worse than the dinosaur's crotch, but as an absurd, tongue-in-the-face fun is a crazy success.
