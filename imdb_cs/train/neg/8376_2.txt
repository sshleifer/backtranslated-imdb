"Little Man," now on DVD, is the Wayans Brothers flop. It's a story less than a ravenous criminal who plays Marlon Wayans, who is hiding a diamond in a women's bag after a robbery. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, are preparing a brilliant plan to masquerade Marlon as a child and experience him at the lady's house. He then goes through all sorts of "home" or "children's games", such as chaos, to get a gem and treat him as a child. I was surprised how low the humor was in this movie. Jokes have been done in other places so many times they are not cute or funny. I almost think the movie could have been fun if they did not use CGI and used the little actor Marlon's face had been inserted into. When watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny like Mini-me, but they chose another way. Several actresses and Tracy Morgan do some fun scenes. It depends on your $ $ Borat rent if you really want to laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
