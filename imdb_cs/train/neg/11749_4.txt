Phil Alien is one of those special movies where humor is based on the peculiarity of everything rather than on real punchlines. At first it was very strange and quite fun, but as the film progressed, I did not (or it was never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but I lost my interest. <br /> <br /> <br /> I imagine that this movie would appeal to the stoner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try "Brother of another planet"
