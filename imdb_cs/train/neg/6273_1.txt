It was a cute movie to the end. The end was just one more contemptuous effort to uproot a man and strengthen women at their expense. The girl refused to obey reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on that guy who eventually gained her power and control over her relationship. It was no coincidence that she was sitting behind the wheel in the car as they left at the end after having asked her and asked her to take him back. This film is the victory of all women who think they should care for all people and control their relationships with them. It was a contemptuous film for this reason.
