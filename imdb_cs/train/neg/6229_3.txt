First of all, let's have a few things right here: a) I'm an anime fan - I've always been in fact (watching Speed ​​Racer all the time in pre-school). b) I like several B movies because they are fun. c) I like Godzilla movies - a lot. <br /> <br /> Moving when the movie first appears, it seems to be your usual B-movie, except for the miserable FX but all suddenly - BOOM! anime appears! That's when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY down. <br /> <br /> Animation is very poor and cheap, worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I remember "live" is when a lot of kids run out of school ... and it's the same kids over and over again! FX are also terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to animation was not organized, dialogue and voices (especially the English oak I saw) was terrible, and I begged my father to pull the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that saved me was ripping jokes and comments like robots, and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Frankly, this is the only way you can hardly enjoy this movie and survive it at the same time. Heck, I'm going to show this to my other colleague to my friend Halloween for B-Movie Night. Because it's silly, pretty painful to watch and inadvertently cheerful at the same time, I give this movie 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 I originally gave. <br /> <br /> (According to my grading scale: 3/10 means quite a lot of both boring and bad. How fun like counting to three if you do not find a way to have fun about it then it will be as fun as counting on 15.)
