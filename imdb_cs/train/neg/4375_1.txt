Less self-confident and much less demanding than GUTS OF BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is worth seeing (at least once). Slim companions want to be actresses / models in a remote house in the forest to be sexually harassed. Sadly (for the horny boys), the long-haired demon who lives in the woods has already gone to the girls for fun. The thing even ends up with the boys' fun - you think it's "funny" scare, tears and masturbation with separate limbs. Again, it all sounds better on paper than it sounds and sounds in the movie. Like Komizu, he has spoiled the TOKYO BAY LIVING ROOM with his disregard, but he can handle this effort and is rescued only by some irritated violence and some big white stockings. <br /> <br /> Do not buy a hype, it will be very disappointed.
