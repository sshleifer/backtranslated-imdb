I've seen this movie long ago ... thankfully it was free. I have to be one of about twenty people who have seen this movie in the theater. I do not remember a lot of things, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, the conspiracy was meaningless, and when I left the theater, all I could say was that at least now I know the worst movie I've ever seen. I was just anxious about one thing: if they can create a temperature when they come close to the sun enough for people to survive, why could they not convert it to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? How stupid they think we are?
