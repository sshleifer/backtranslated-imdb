I've given 3 stars out of 10 - because stories are open and left unexplained, and because of the nasty scenes of someone who eats an extremely disgusting way, and scenes from a decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above may be displayed graphically. The film plot in question concerns three loosely linked stories, none of which are satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The reward hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is a character that combines all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First, we have Dylan McDermott, escaped to Mexico to escape both law and hunters as he crosses the border town and captures the sad lounge played by Helen Hunt. Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, you are not sure which one is playing a western wife on a lonely outskirt, who is going to look at a neighboring woman, an attractive redhead, who soon realize she was in badlands a little too long. <br /> <br /> The film's end will return to the hunters of talent and what will happen to it, because the last scene in the film is completely out of rational understanding.
