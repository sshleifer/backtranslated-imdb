The cult movie from 1977 includes two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who appear in the house of wealthy Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel) in the hope of helping them find a place they do not seem to be. But these two men mean other plans when he finds out that George's wife is out of town but eventually take control of the residence, join George and kill the guy who bore them and destroy the place one evening. A bizarre and disturbing movie, but these two will only receive a reward in the same bizarre way as the film ends. Most of them either will not pay back, or even get into this absurd movie after about 30 minutes. Even though some even consider it a cult classic. Larry Dodson
