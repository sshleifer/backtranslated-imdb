Only the most terrible fan of DORIS DAY could find this, even bearable. When one thinks about the wealth of material that is available for the story of the most famous break in New York - a film that could deal with many real stories about what people have to deal with, it destroys the bottom of the barrel due to the lack of original story. <br /> <br /> Again, Doris is indignant because she suspects she might be at risk of darkening at night when she returns to her home in Connecticut, she takes a sleeping potion and wakes up in the morning with a man who did the same, into the house. No one is able to rescue this mess - not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As she was driving Hy Averback, it was the weakest vehicle to find a day that was committed to making a movie because of her husband's machinations and could not get away from it. Very bad.
