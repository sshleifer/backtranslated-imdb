This very low budget movie comedy caper will only succeed in a low budget. The dialogue is incredibly stupid, the chasing scenes are evenly boring and most of the money on the screen looks like it has been spared a series of blasts and blasts in the parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie (she briefly saw the porthole and the potty soon in the scene is surely wrecked and dirty crap on the main villain of the movie - there is no purpose). The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that sometimes went out of the studio of Rodger Corman when the director first made a few bucks and a camera - but without the discipline that Corman would have imposed.
