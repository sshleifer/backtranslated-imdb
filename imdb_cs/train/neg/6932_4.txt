I waited for a long time to look at DR TARR'S TURBUROV DUNGEON, and after watching him I was really disappointed. It's not the baroque movie I expected. The trailer (which I saw on Something Weird DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgotten. There are not nearly any emerging scenes, and the appearance and appearance are interesting, but even close to other Baroque-styled Fellini or Jodorowski films. The characters are boring and almost nothing dramatic happens, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was talk-and more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead of seeing / listening to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about tedious things. Missed opportunity.
