This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen. There is no doubt that the script writer has ever read the book Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and gloomy as Rochester - if not just ordinary old anger. Susannah York has the most dated 1970 hairstyle I've ever seen in the Victorian movie. Characters barely speak of themselves, so the rich joke that is in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and constant love is gone. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please find the Timothy Dalton version instead. The book is so true, it's like having a novel that reads you aloud. Dalton is great as Rochester. G.C. Scott is ridiculous.
