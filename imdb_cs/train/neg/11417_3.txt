The juvenile group in Sagittarius Elm, who just came out of college, seems to be able to go through high school for much less than four years at any major university. Mostly, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but the co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to hold them like touch stones for generations. With the now obsolete occupation "up and forward", the background of a score that sounds terribly similar to "Conditional Term", and writing which gentlemen sadness of this circle above us, "Fire" is a miserable fire, one that is even more embarrassing when years going through. * 1/2 from ****
