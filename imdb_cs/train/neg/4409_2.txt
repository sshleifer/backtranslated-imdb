Strictly routine, according to the number of Westerns (directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, is that all wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith flew with crazy band Dean Martin, who had just kidnapped the Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who had never found his place after Pussy Galore in the movie "Goldfinger".) Fist fighting, shots, robbers, and Denver Pyle in a supporting role. in other words, absolutely nothing new or original.Keith tries in a low monotonous interview with a prostitute (something after the shock of his running in TV "family affairs"), but otherwise this low-rent material will lose Keith's friendly talents. a message for Dina, who does not seem to notice or care about her. Hack direction, bad writing and several unsuccessful attempts at lowball humor.
