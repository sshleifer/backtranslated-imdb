You can not hold on too much because he knew it was done in four days and I expected he would still be camping. (Actually, it's not all, but with the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not get serious about themselves, the rest of the cast plays halfway, Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The laughing story is really paid attention that shocked me; I assumed that the whole thing with these ultra-low-budget horror films should provide the most basic sexual fantasies and can not be damned about the story, but they use a lot of words like "technological" and "physical" in the script. their point across. (Although it is possible that the story is important just to explain why there are so few members.) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline, and the only things that are interesting in the movie are mockery of cults and soft-core homoeroticisms not all it's nervous). I would enjoy it more if it were just a few random killings without reason. The film is grainy, with a TV-quality look and play. There are several "sexy" scenes that are fine - the boys who went to bed in the boxing felt themselves; or are bound and make orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them - and some of them are a bit funny. I liked the excavations with L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of the story of religious cultures with intense gay stimuli, but it still is not good. 3/10
