There is not much I can say that this movie is horrible. The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being, because the ancestors were hard to sell. Tell the audience that every Chinese knows the history of the Chinese without studying it, just ridiculous. It's like saying that every American knows American history without study, or every Filipino, etc. Atd. It's simply untrustworthy. The story is absolutely hideous. He spoke of Shin coming from a monastery in China - later he identified him from Bejing. The initial sequence of the film, however, shows a map focused on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas such as Mongolia as its own. But it is a distinct nation, and even maps the "Mongolia" on the map. Disney Studios has failed the 5th level of geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is at best superficial and still somehow focuses on it. Her training is just cheese. And it allows cutting into pursuit: everything about this movie is bad. It's so bad to laugh and cry. Taekwondo has been playable and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The evil eye was cheese. However, the left-wing end would be the only origin. They should leave the evil eyes that ended up in it. But instead, some evil is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not worth the time of the dog in the movie. Brenda Song should go with another studio. "F"
