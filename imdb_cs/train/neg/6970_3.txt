Now it would be a clich√© if I started a bit about the title, so I'll wait for it. First of all, this film has been thinking about why kids are making stupid things, like going through the labs and smashing bottles. Then I realized it was a movie with a message that the message was slaughtered by children and such things would not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a huge insectile monster that grew up and caused a little chaos before they died in the typical fashion of "killing the enemy." Now, as promised ... The Blue Monkey ... does not have anything blue, no Simian of any kind. Now it's like in the evening or something. The image on the envelope had a huge mistake on the front (crab / idiot) that hurt some shouted sisters. It happened, but I wanted apes! that you took a couple of hours before you first picked up (not just drunk on Cask sauce and Creame's brandy), I was in the mood for the next style of hijackers. Not so much. If you like a snowdrift or blue stuff, this movie is not for you. If you like mistakes and good reasons to hit children, rent it.
