This was the first sequel I've seen (except the Return of Jafara), and I honestly thought, before I look at it, that it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. The story was basically the first script with several other characters and the situation turned. Ariel and Eric have a daughter Melody who is not happy with the life on earth. She wants to become a marine virgin. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds her angry and angry. And she decides to run away, and she becomes a sea virgin. So she's happy to swim and Ariel decides to find her - like a mermaid. The story does not look too badly written, but the clich√©s and the repetition of the first film are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is totally unpleasant and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There is also a whole load of other new characters - two and one tip. They are not too bad as characters themselves - just do not think about Timon or Pumbaa! Songs leave a lot of time because they do not have the same magical energy as the original songs. Animation, of course, was not wearing all the work it was put into - it's partly nervous and there's not much imagination for character moves. Another advice - try to forget Ariel's original character while watching this movie. A beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager "grew up" into a boring, boring woman and mother and her red hair tied. It's much better to see if you've never seen the original - you'll have nothing to compare with. However, all in all, it could be worse - it's not as bad as a sequel next to Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But for your collection, if nothing but Disney will continue like this, they will lose all of their older fans.
