This is another production in northeast Florida, shot mainly near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was somewhat surprised that the company managed to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach for as long as it was necessary to reach street scenes. The film is nice and bad. Tami Erin is cute but exaggerated. Eileen Brennan exaggerated even more. Good for small children or for those who have a great taste. And 4 of the Miller-Movies formula.
