I wanted to see the movie due to an article in a movie magazine. It was not a critic critic. The story is different and I'm sure it could be a good movie if it was in the right hand. Direction and acting were terrible! I felt like watching a movie that became a lot of amateurs. Though the film started promising, it worsened. I think this is a non-original film with inappropriate characters. I still think it's worth watching because I have not seen gay porn movies. Do not keep your expectations high, then you will be very disappointed. * outside *****
