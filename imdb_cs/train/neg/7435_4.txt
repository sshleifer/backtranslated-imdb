This film (together with Rinne) is a tiny gemstone among the retread poetry that has gone on for horror films so far on the 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And yes, that's a really weak praise. Because the film is not much worse in the movie than you would think the atmosphere is a substitute for a continuous conspiracy. And that's all you get with the abandoned. This is a movie that was created almost exclusively by directors. Sure, it would be nice if he turned it into a movie, but instead it happened. It's a very nice film with some real horrors, but the last reel is exclusively for the latte, which was moving the viewer.
