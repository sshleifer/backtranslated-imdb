I usually know after the first minute of the movie whether I hate it or have fun ... but now I was wrong. The beginning was great; "It's based on a true story," and the blah blah blah was fun. Cartons and a description of the life of boys with pictures made me think that I made the right choice. Then I saw the fake fake look of Toronto, which was great. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed the first confirmation. <br /> <br /> This was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looked like eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just can not understand English Canadian humor (it is possible, Canadian English also do not always understand Quebecois humor), but hey ... it was enough for a short film, nothing more. Maybe it could be for the title? In any case, almost everything was fulfilled, and in my opinion there were few things in my opinion. In fact, "creation" was better than film. At least you understand the motivation behind what caused everything bad. The potential of this idea was great; that's why I leased the movie because I was interested in something "unpleasant disappearance of people". But I still did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and even some point to the movie. If you are Canadian English, it seems that you would appreciate the local humor given the surprising number of people who gave this film 8. Otherwise just think twice before you lose your precious time ...
