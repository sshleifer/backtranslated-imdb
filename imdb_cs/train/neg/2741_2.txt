Buoyancy builder !! I love Branagha, I love Helen Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Frankenstein's Mary Shelley" - but THIS - I understand the actor's desire to stretch to avoid a romantic stereotype. Well, but that really - the script was hiding, Bonham-Carter's clothes were a bit of a skilful and sometimes speeded sequence of "fools" could be a shot of Beatles' movie or old Rowan and Martin Laugh - V. he did not have - the other commentators say Branagh's character was a dreamer. I never felt it. He was loser and he was not very clear and certainly not cute. The business of disguising a bank robber was just painful to watch. Definitely not fun. Bonham-Carter's realistic (one assumes) experiments like realistic speech were harder to grasp than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty". <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him high up on the hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too orchestrated. Was there a chorus of angels or just a soundtrack? Go back to the classic, or something with a back and an arc. Donate it to PBS. <br /> <br />
