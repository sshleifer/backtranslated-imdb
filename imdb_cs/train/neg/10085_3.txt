Why do all the movies in Life have such anemic titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​oh oh, provocative! "That's what I know," would be better. The film is nothing special. Real people really do not talk like they do these characters and the situations are really hackneyed. A terrible woman who "turns" a lesbian, looked much more than a lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot women kisses in a very discreet fashion, you can enjoy it. Although it appears to have been written by someone who does not really go out in the world to watch people. Why do I waste my time on it?
