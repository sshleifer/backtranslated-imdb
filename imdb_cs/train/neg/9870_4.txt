I had several problems with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) Scenario - specifically, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; should * show an action rather than have a voice over * tell us what's going on. Sometimes I find a movie with a voice of what works, but here it looked more like a lazy way to write a script. In fact, it sounded like she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) In the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas, I felt no emotion, and I felt that Alex Carter's acting was pretty bad. This is a significant failure for me to define the characters of Jessie and Tomas - without any connection, it seemed to me just like a stud and it was a question of being sexually deprived of him. If it were done correctly, the relationship between them would give the story much more. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie, it looked more like just boring. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the movie was as bad as turning off the television. . . even if it happened to me.
