I was hoping that it would be a "thought provoking" little jewel, people were examining it like. I like indy movies and I expect to copy it too. Knowing what a hot button this topic is I expect to really enjoy, maybe even see the outsider perspective. all I can say is wow .... if your torture or mutilation goes on then you may like it. I personally do not like the idea that I cut or cut it, so I thought it was garbage. bad script, bad behavior, bad story, bad direction, bad adjustments ... I could go on. I have no idea why the reviewer claimed that he or she is making a political point by saying that the film is 10. It's misleading and ignorant. voting for IMDb movie does not specify a precedent! it just allows other people to think that such a waste bomb is fine to be watched until it's controversial (this film is not, it's trying to be very hard but it fails). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when you pray for 15 minutes that all the main characters will die terribly. they will, of course, die, but not in painful ways to give the audience some justice or contempt for looking at the 2 hours of crap they have just experienced. <br /> <br /> do a favor, just do not bother. I have this movie in the basket at the local video shop in 50 years and feel it is broken!
