Someone mentioned editing. This is badly adjusted, and what started as somewhat interesting has become an incomprehensible disorder. For beginners, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experiment they are engaging in? And what exactly do they test? There seems to be some spectacular plan to be used by some agencies. The game is pretty bad. Everybody emulates. Everyone holds secrets. They often say that if it was not for money, they hung up. There is an uprooted minister who fired the Scripture. Further and further. But again the biggest suspension is the lack of delimitation of the playing field for actors. There are some really cheese elements. Those small rooms and chaise longues. A terrible wallpaper (it was a wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it did not seem to go anywhere.
