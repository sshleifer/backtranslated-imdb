Huge disappointment with writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season of "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly cheerful in all the right ways. This misunderstanding of the fascinating premise left me confused. The anticipated payout of generic extraterrestrials that extracted something from the brains of infected psychopaths was totally unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet of its infestation by man, why are they doing so in an unreasonably sadistic and misogynistic way? Why not just unleash the completely deadly virus and at Stephen King's "stand" instead of having a male population of female butchery? I still hoped that this episode would improve as I kept looking, but it just became more demanding and ambiguous. The Christian subtext seemed to be forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm thought he was the deep weight he gave. I like a lot of Dante and Hamm work, but that was just inconsistent.
