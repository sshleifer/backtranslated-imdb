The first ten minutes of Just Looking really dictates the direction most of the movie takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York City in the 1950s. He has a burning desire to see that two people have sex. Who are the best people she has in mind? Well, my own mother and stepfather, of course! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before seeing anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his wife. Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife sex. However, the woman is quite pregnant and is not sleeping together at the moment. Then Lenny will create a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. They have a small club where everything they do is sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it was not done in an innocent, enchanting way of the 1950s. I did not understand in any way, but I found it a little disturbing when I listened to these kids talking about masturbation, smoking and anal sex. This kind of stupidity can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it looks just perverse. Gretchen Mol is totally useless as Hedy, a former bra model that will become Lenny's bodily desire. Jason Alexander must stay as far as the head of the chair. "For Better or Worse" (1996) was horrible and now this. What a shame. 1/10
