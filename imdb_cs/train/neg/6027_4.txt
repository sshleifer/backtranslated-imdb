I grew up with Baptists, and I know what story this movie is trying to say, even if I do not believe in the story. I'm going to give the film the same feeling that it's as good as the average life of the movie of the week. Slightly interesting, acting acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is full and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people who left behind had ever to be cleansed by un-Christians. Not one damn word from any of them. But I laughed loudly when an actor who plays a man who controls the United Nations pronounced "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler" just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that requires Bush to assert that God also calls that all Christians must conceal their ignorance by improperly pronouncing this word just as he does? LOL! I really had a hard time making the movie still serious. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the film began to feel like packed manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something courageous. In fact, I was looking for something to think about but I did not find myself here. If you're looking for hopeless fun, stop here - it's good that you killed a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
