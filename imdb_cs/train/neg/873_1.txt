Powerful, very successful in his professional life, but very incompetent in his known life, meets a boy with a syndrome down, escaping from the residence. Both characters feel very lonely and seemingly less intelligent to show the executive director the beauty of little things in life ... With this argument, with some atmosphere like Am√©lie and sentimental music I did not expect a moralistic disgusting film. Anyway, because there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqual Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. French cinematography generally has the ability to show something that seems quite a lot of life, compared to a stereotypical American film. But because of that, he is much more disappointed to see the absurd end, the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the luck of the CEO's family, the inexpensive morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the waving man from the sky like Michael Landon ... Really hideous, in my humble opinion.
