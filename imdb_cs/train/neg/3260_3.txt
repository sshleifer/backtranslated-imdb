Doc Savage: A man of bronze is a terrible movie. Badly written, exaggerated and simply stupid. That was said ... it's really a nice movie at some level. This film begun to be watched in a group with a rich offer of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus Martians" or "Yor, Hunter of the Future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a blast that you can watch. It's campy. It is fun. It has a theme from Sousa. But if you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors that some studio is exploring the possibility of remake ...
