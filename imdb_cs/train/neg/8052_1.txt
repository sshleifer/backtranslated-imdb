I sat with this step because I had not seen it before, and because the assumptions sounded as if it had the potential. It was just fun up to the hurricane. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow the windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly erect and the leaf does not move! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the bright sunlight is visible to illuminate tree trees. At this point, no matter what the creators believed, it vanished faster than the highly localized rain in their movie. The pity that all hurricanes are not like this will surely help our insurance rates for homeowners in the Sunshine State.
