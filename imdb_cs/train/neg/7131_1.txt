I like bad movies. I like to borrow bad movies with my friends and I suffer for them all the time. These are also filthy movies. Redline is not just a bad film, but it's a sign that the American film industry should enjoy at least the scripts for the viewer at least before the real movie. If the stereotype took the crap, this movie would have culminated. The story is unbearable, and acting all around is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have perhaps the worst screen of chemistry I've ever seen, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and slaughtered with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street dealers (the only thing they can legitimately claim) ). Moreover, as Angus Macfadyen convinced himself that he was doing this film, it is so far behind me that I can not even think about analogy. I'm his loyal fan, but that made me ask. <br /> <br /> To summarize. Several people want to avenge for various reasons (and if you have enough consciousness of what they are, you are a greater person than me) so much that it turns into violence (I think). The film is like Ouroboros, a snake that sweeps its own tail because it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that is not suited to human ears. This film is, for the first half, essentially one big commercial car, and for the rest of the insignificant action film, all the expenses have to be avoided. I wish I could find one positive aspect of the film, and I think it is the fact that the loans are rotating. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you were going to sing these two songs in this movie, then you're hacking and I hope your old time will spoil you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie and want a funny experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's wonderful songs.
