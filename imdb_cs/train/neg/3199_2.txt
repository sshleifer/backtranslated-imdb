Joe Don Baker. He was great in "Walking Tall" and played a good role in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone ... the dark party won. <br /> <br /> As with most people, my main experience with this person was on the MST3K and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots kick their claws deep into Baker's rich body and squeeze completely. Obviously they are just starting out with "Mitchell" on their kicking against Joe Don and here lies their sequel on the subject. But it's a fun experience: there are plenty of selection riffs. My favorite - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's" Meatloaf: Texas Ranger, "" None of them is very abundant, "" Why was she wearing a prom dress? "Son? this is the son: Mana's son? "<br /> <br /> The ultimate righteousness itself is, as Joe Don states in the film," Big Fat Nada. "But it really has some value of entertainment here. a version of "Final Justice." <br /> <br /> Two Stars for "Ultimate Justice." Ten for MST3K LEN. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
