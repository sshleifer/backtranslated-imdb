How this movie might lack so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or original film is truly remarkable. Unbelievably thin and unimaginable plot, deep ankle characterization / motivation and a really terrible soundtrack (replacing the tension with huge noise, replacing the mysterious original reference music for digitized crashes and anger). There are specific references to the original that are simply "plastered" over cracks. Wonderful In a world where the powerless, dead American flips the Italian work (tears appear), Get Carter (sobbing uncontrollably), and Alfie desecrated our screens recently, this has proverbial biscuits. Cheerful nonsense How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a miracle ... Disgust.
