This step was yesterday on television. I think it's like a filler of time, because it burns badly! The film is just an excuse to show a few goats and asses at the beginning and somewhere in half. (Not bad boobs and ass even though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "Wolf", if he is what he can say, is barely shown to save his teeth. When it's okay, you can see that some CGI trainees are running because the wolf runs like running in a treadmill and CGI skin looks as if it's waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <Film is full of gore and blood, and you can easily find out who is going to kill / destroy / eat. Even if you like such movies, you will be disappointed, did not do a good job. <br /> <br /> Do not even start with the actors ... the girls shout every five seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do a bad deal, just give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up? Overall boring and ridiculous horror.
