Welcome to the story of a bad spirit and someone's nightmares. This horror story finds a newly married husband (John Hudson) and a wife (Peggy Weber) who recalls the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls, which lie in the empty manor and the lily pond. Is the husband really trying to drive his already terrible harlot mad? Or is it a scholar gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol), who cared for the manor estate since the death of the original lady of the house? This low-budget horror movie has a story that will keep you in the final. The special effects are bad even in 1958. I swear that the screaming skull sounds like it should be in the movie Godzilla. Also in Cast as Reverend Snow is a character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... lurking gardener (Nicol) is director of the film. You can capture this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
