I do not know where to start; acting, special effects, and writing are just as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff reached the point where he said, "Our work is done, time to release it". I'm just glad that the first two in the series have never reached the UK. I would really recommend watching this movie just so you can see how well most movies are. <br /> <br /> I do not know how one of the other IMDb users could be afraid when they were "scary" down the corridors with rubber arms around them.
