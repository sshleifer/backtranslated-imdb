This is just one of the horror movies you find in Lifetime TV that portray the disgusting behavior of some disgusting women in an empathic way. Together with other dirty movies like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster," this movie experiences a disgusting criminality and tries to show the audience why it is not such a bad person at all. Give us a break! Here's my question for the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you be sympathetic and empathetic with this person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you will change the sex in this movie, and then you see why I and others think it is worthless garbage. If the sex changed, there would be no attempt to sympathize with a criminal. Instead, we would probably be treated with the introduction of a giant and detestable person who enjoys a young girl, his lascivious behavior that leads him to jail, and his washed-out brain suffering from Stockholm syndrome. The only reason why LeTourneau does not have the same treatment in this film is sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call it a spade of spades. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Simple and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. He is a criminal who belongs to prison and deserves our sadness and contempt, but it is certainly not our regret or empathy.
