This is a thriller with a good concept, a good actor, a good shot and good intentions all around, but who is confused and unrelated to the execution. Garcia plays as John Berlin, a detective detective LA, who moved to a small California city on the command of his boyfriend in the local power. Soon he will begin investigating unresolved murders that lead to his theorizing of the existence of a serial killer that no one else believes. Known victims are theorized as blind, leading to romanticism with the blind - believed to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. In spite of a very interesting story, there were too many quantum leaps and holes in this movie where I was interested, "how the hell did we do here?" Or "how did they find out?" I found out he was confusing and unconnected, despite good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part to end as F.B.I. investigator to get to Berlin. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
