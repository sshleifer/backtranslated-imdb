It gets two because I liked it like a baby but it started to be so redundant that I started to hate it ... I can not give it a descriptive review because it would be one thing after the other I probably would not say anything else did not say. The only other thing on this show is that it's quite unpleasant, with a guy boasting about that twisted watch over the stupidity that runs around and inside her. I have a cousin who loves this show, and it's the strangest and deepest person I've met. This show should be pulled out of the air. It's always the same thing over and over ... They need a better show. I'm really so tired of such things.
