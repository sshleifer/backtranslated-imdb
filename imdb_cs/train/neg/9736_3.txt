It is often said that Tobe Hooper just hit the happy horror movie "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" in 1974 and every time I see another film Hooper - this view is only amplified. It seems that Hooper wanted to create his own versions of films in 1990, such as Scanners and Firestarter, so we end up with spontaneous combustion; a movie with a few good ideas and a whole lot more borrowed from other films. You put it together and you get a dirty, boring movie that most people would do well to not notice! The film leads the audience to believe it might be decent at first and the beginning of a mysterious story that focuses on experiments conducted by two young people in the 1950s. The couple has a baby and shortly afterwards burns him as a result of the attempts made on him. Fast forward for several years and the baby is now an adult named Sam; but naturally he is not a normal person and will soon find out when he finds that he has the ability to best adjust things. <br /> <br /> Star film Brad Dourif, who had to look like a good casting choice for his success with Child's Play two years earlier; but in reality it was an uninformed decision, because the central performance is really terrible; and it does not help with terrible support. The turbulent direction and the boring scenario also make the film a lot of favors, and the trend of inadequate kindness continues with special effects that are very unrealistic and have nothing to do with the films that tear it off; which were produced a few years ago. The conspiracy is really slow and it's almost an hour before something happens, so I did not care. Soon, the direction of the movie is revealed, and it all comes down to such a boring end that you would expect. The final confrontation is a great disappointment and nothing is explained in the film. Not that some revelation was just as interesting. Overall, this is a broom and another reason why Tobe Hooper is far from being a heroic director. Check out the Firestarter again.
