This film, no correction, this thing, the unrelenting abomination of the burning hell pits should be killed before she even left the writer's head. I could not come up with a sufficient adjective to describe this movie. But try it. Terrible, bad, tame, tasteless, bullshit, vomiting provoking, intestines poor poor, abominable, ugly, ugly, there simply is not enough words in English! The "plot" includes a serial killer who becomes snow. Do not ask how important it is. A killer snowman runs on killing people. How can he ask, can a snowman kill someone? In the flavorful ways that you want to remove from your eyes, if only so you do not have to endure that Styrofoam snowman anymore. Thanks to the way you want your ears to fill with hot wax, you will not have to endure your snowstorms. Do not look for this movie! Destroy it! Do not look for your soul!
