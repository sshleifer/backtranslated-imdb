If I had only one camera that was accidentally stuck to the floor, it was enough to shoot just one shot of each shot, and then he lost the whole movie and had to scrape off some money to buy some digital video cassettes and was forced to do more than 2 hours a film about the French Revolution and also had no ensembles, and my four-year-old autistic son had to paint the background, and the only actors I could find were people to audition for solo opera this year, and I was also forced not to use music all over the film and the zoom function on the camera did not work, except for the one time when the zooming started accidentally and it was not possible to stop, oh and if I hate my audience, then I could do something like this terrible but miserable, hell of a waste time. The almost spectacular, but utterly false views remind me of some of George Lucas's latest creations that disappointed it, because in the whole movie it was the little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the movie was culminating in a duel with laser combat / space laser battle. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who did not see it, but it is not. The only thing I could think was that she lost more time than watching this movie wrote this review. Peace.
