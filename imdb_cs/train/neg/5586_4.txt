Man To Man is trying hard to be a good movie: He has his heart in the right place, he wants to be epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. However, there are some problems with this image. He strives so hard to be good and to receive his message that sometimes the viewer must feel uncontested. So it's only adequate that the paintings that are used in this picture are simplistic - Man To Man does not allow a viewer to decide what he thinks is right, but in his head hammers his message. Joseph Fiennes explains this in his role: he does everything to look worried, really moving, and all the other emotions you can express with the only expression of the face that his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is too long and loses its speed towards the end that you can easily conclude that Man To Man is not worth watching. There is, however, enough points to defend him: he is fun, has some humorous scenes and show-theft Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it with humanistic art pieces such as The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will leave the theater happy. He tries to grasp your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and will succeed most of the time.
