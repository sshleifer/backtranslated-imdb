The protocol is an unpredictable film whose only eternal love is that star Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of actors. The story turns around the cocktail, which becomes famous when it inadvertently saves the life of the Arab dignitary. The story goes uphill to the middle of the movie, and Goldie's spell does not save this movie. If you are not a fan of Goldie Hawn, you will not be out of the way to see this movie.
