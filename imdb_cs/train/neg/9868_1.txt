I almost never comment on movies, but I've seen 5 shining reviews of this "movie" and decided I have to consider my own review. My engineer got this film by post, which was mixed with his test academies (AMPAS, aka guys who voted for the Oscars), and was so underpinned by how horrifically he made this film that he brought him into our class to show us how to BUILD the film. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot, the scenes are horrible, terribly modified (often using faux "24" style-picture-in-picture techniques) and performances (especially lead, which even failed to act as bad actress) are largely unpleasant. Someone really could not understand the point of introduction, namely the creation of a plot. There is no setting! In the middle of the movie, neither me nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to look like. The opening crane that causes a murder is never solved, and now that I think about it, it was probably considered a glimpse of the moment, the rest of the film is a memory, but it becomes a scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I can really go on and on. At least this film gives me renewed confidence in my own ability to create a movie.
