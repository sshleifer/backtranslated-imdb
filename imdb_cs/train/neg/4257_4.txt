"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who struggle with Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal his blood for an auction, it's an offer they can hardly deny. Students are also inexorably persecuted by the Vatican vampires! "Dracula II: Rise" is a bit of an amusing horror movie that has many mistakes. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is quite average. there are some good gore effects like a really cool double scene, but there is not enough violence for me. The film becomes quickly boring and forgotten and there is absolutely no tension. So if you like modern vampire movements, give him a look. atmospheric cooling vampires from the 1960s and 1970s, such as "The Lips of Bride," or "Lemora: The Story of the Supernatural Children," to name just a few out of 4 out of 10.
