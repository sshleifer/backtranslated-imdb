this show is one of the worst shows ALL TIME! absolutely no original jokes and they are always a year late. as in 2009, I will finally say something about Michael Vicky's fights. all the cast members are people who wanted to be on SNL but had to go to the lowest of the low, crazy TV.it in an hour of mad witty magazine witches first funny, said ghastly John Stewart wants bees. so if you have a problem, tell me that I like to hear the opinion of the three people who are watching this show. the family boy did it well. "Osama bin Laden was hiding in a place where nobody seemed to be occupying a mad television broadcast There is a reason why nobody is watching the show.
