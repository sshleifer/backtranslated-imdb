This movie is really boring. It was forbidden in Chinese cinema and I see why. This is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of low quality. I would never want to pay the money to watch. I like movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yima, and I'm disappointed with such a poor movie that could come from China. He seems to be totally ignoring the audience and it seems that the director made a film for himself. The shots of a man who stood there and doing nothing in a minute are glad and there is plenty. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I looked at the film on the Internet and it seems like he really likes this movie. The only explanation that I think is that some film fans think that if the movie is not in English, it is automatically good. I do not see any reason why people like it. this is not an artistic movie, it's a wasting celluloid (that's if they actually shot him on a movie they did not do)
