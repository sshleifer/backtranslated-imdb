It is clear why Scary filmmakers have found it so easy to refute these teen slasher films. They are so incredibly creative. And if Valentine were released a year or so, I'm sure they would try this movie too - it would be if they found some real original material that would make it different from Shouts, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine's Day does not offer anything new to this genre, except for a better than usual end, which of course leaves plenty of room for inevitable sequel. As always, a camouflaged psychotic killer runs a bunch of beautiful young women and kills friends of the main character, one by one, usually in the upper style. Lots of T & A on the screen, no character development, bad acting and over-complicated bloodshed. The thing that I can not stand in these films is that they are passed on like "who did it?" The point is that they are not because the motif reveals itself after the killer has revealed himself and tells the main characters who are now all of them are murdered, usually never done so clearly (for example, his mother's fisherman's mother's knight kicked out his friend's father.) They all stay alive throughout the movie, they're "suspicious," but rather "Red Herrings" than suspects As we all know, the main character can handle an unlikely escape and kills an uninitiated psychic killer after discovering the motif. "Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter *************** RUŠIČ VZTLAKU !!!!! ! (as well as a mini-spoiler) *************** In Valentin's motif it was not revealed, but more, he let you think about the film not quite closing in a typical teen slash " . The problem is only partially solved and the target of a murderous killer may or may not be fulfilled by surviving bloodshed and killing almost all. Will the killer want more, or would the demons really defeat? Valentina did not do a good movie, instead he just saved it from being as bad as usual, which is still not for many. If you want to think about another movie in this direction, please do not. Originality is so important, and it is hard to see any original coming out of this genre.
