First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and it's terrible. This film has every fake movement of fantasy clich√©s and they all played badly. A young couple who is superior to sex. Comic (not) horny jock. Tasty little girl. Horrible local guy. Parenting couple. A doll who will not die incredibly in these films. The dialogue is so painfully horrible and comes with the depth of the wading pool. It's almost like you want everyone to die sooner. I saw a rough cut of the film some time ago, but somehow it got worse. Sure, the most fun thing about here is a ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but he barely evaluates the rent of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
