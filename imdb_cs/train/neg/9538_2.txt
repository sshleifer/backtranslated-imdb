When I saw this commercial, I noticed it. Forgive me, but it's been so long since I've seen I do not remember how it was. Just say that the movie I saw had no resemblance to the "movie" they were selling to me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, poisoned and incredibly disappointed with this film. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink the horrible reggae music. It's not really moody music for horror movie, huh? I guess if you've never seen a commercial (or a trailer, I assume), maybe you think it's some hot stuff. For my money, the ad was much better.
