John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are friends on their way to Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fair rival, but he finds out that if he is not willing to accept twenty-five cents a dollar for a winner from a bloody promoter, he will have to earn his winnings for his armor. Quite the same, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decided that they would like the rest of the rodeo; they shoot the promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and it looks like Scott and Kansas Charlie are killers. Wayne and Chandler use a gag running in a movie where they are going to go with their fists through various trivialities. Every time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne's foot packs him and fools him stupidly. If you are very attentive, there is a pure Lipton tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scott's love interest is Anne Mary Kornman). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, friends are re-bounded at the robbery stage. Have a change of heart and see the error of his paths, the evil guy wants him to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete will shoot him. While he's upgraded, Jim tells his story to doctors and sister Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne walks right in the middle of a shootout between good guys and villains to face the sheriff. "Desert Trail" is one of the most beautiful John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Production during this era. Apparently missing George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are usually seen in these oaters. If you are a fan of John Wayne, you have to see it once, but it will probably be enough.
