The premise of the African-American Scrooge woman in a modern, fighting city was inspired, but nothing else in this film. Here Mrs. Scrooge is a crazy banker who uses employees and customers in the very poor and black neighborhood he lives in. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the stakeholders. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the roots of the story do not concern the urban environment of this movie and the script can not update. Also, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so infinitely, the audience is tired of it before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a movie that does not know when to end. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives too quick a performance, and sometimes lines are difficult to grasp. The novel Charles Dickens has been adapted many times; it is an attempt to adapt it so that it is fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
