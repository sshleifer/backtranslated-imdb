Boyle's performance I liked, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most actors spoke as if you were expecting your 9-year-old nephew to talk if he pretends to be a crazy, stone policeman or ultra-evil villain. The sinister voices seemed amateur. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and start a better opening of the music. And what about the whole torture police? It was absolutely useless and had nothing to do with current stories. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he seemed to be really great, but he had nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges's stories so good is his minimalism - they are tightly bound, without unnecessary detail. This film is just the opposite. I stopped after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from Yidische Zaitung or there. I paid $ 4 for rent, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review, and hopefully I'll save others from making the same mistake.
