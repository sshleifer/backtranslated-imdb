Last night I saw the movie and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie have been rising since I heard that it's doing. Some days I've seen something magnificent and some days I'd be disappointed. Still, I'm a fan, I've had great hopes for this movie, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> While I love Richard Donner's movies, I did not like their sometimes camping nature or changes that made Superman's charm and his powers. But Singer decided to take the worst elements of Donner and put them in their version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is a little darker, there is nothing more than a shyster, a conman and a common criminal. He is no more intelligent than Gene Hackman played. Kevin Spacey is trying to play Luthor well, but he eventually became a victim of bad writing and unimaginable dialogue. Its followers are more than two-dimensional than even a comic book. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski has almost the same character as Mrs. Tesmacher. He seems to be as bad and cold as Lex Luthor, but he proves he's just a cheater who falls apart after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betraying Luthor. The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Langella as Perry White. I was not a huge fan of Perry White's peak in Donner, but at least he had a soul. He still said and did, a veteran reporter who cared for the truth and a good story. Langelina Perry White is nothing but corporate. He wants everyone to focus on Superman-related stories because they sell papers, even if every other paper does the same thing. It does not matter the real stories, real mysteries such as black and what Lex Luthor is up to now that is out of jail. The worst thing about Langell is that he's DULL! Some actors can be calm and sober, and yet they have a lance that will allow you to know that the water is still deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It's fine, but there's no unforgettable line again in the whole movie. Not the actor's blame. Its movements should clearly look like they look lovely, just as the smallest finger movement affects the way it flies. But it still looks choreographically and artificially. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, while badly written, was surprisingly Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again for journalists and writers who won the Pulitzer Award, it is as eloquent as any teenager from Dawson's Creek. James Marsden was my favorite actor in the movie, mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without superstars, he can find out the Lois Lane message, fly the plane, get on board Luthor's yacht, and save Lois and her son. The only moving moment in the movie is when everyone is caught panting when it is flooded with water and the boat sinks. You see how they slowly dip into the water. You know that Superman comes at the last minute to save them, but you still can not help but I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> As I said before the plot is very random. Unlike Singer, he is not a movie about returning the superhero and finding his place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one who does not like to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because he gives him a chance to match the score with a man of steel. Superman appears to be one of the most stupid heroes in the universe. The big green smoke of the meteorite is stolen from the museum, Lex Luthor is out of jail, now has the knowledge of supernatural powers and weaknesses, and yet still is unable to connect touch enough to know that Luthor uses the kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the only thing Superman is good for lifting really, really hard stuff. The action sequences are incredibly predictable.
