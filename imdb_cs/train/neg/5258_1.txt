Well, I rented the movie and found it really angry. This is the family with a stepmother and the same stupid family struggles, then the cold son comes with a stupid camera and likes to take a photo of the damaged building and strange things and a strange movie and then asks his father to take him on the side road and simply agrees etc etc. ..... They go to a city that nobody knows there is (blah blah blah) And most annoying is that the movie ends and you still do not have what the movie is? I saw many mysterious movies, but it was the worst, frankly no description, and I would not even notice it.
