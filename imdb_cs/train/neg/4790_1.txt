I did not want this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many other horror films, it looked and felt like some scary, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, since the late 1980s, has run out of action, but has kept this nice attention on the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is terrible. It is hard to explain all the strange events in previous films, rather than expanding their power. Unhappily degrades images from the first fantasy as a cheap reconstruction of the original. There are so many flying balls in this movie that seem more like domestic pests than menacing death. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls that swing in the lane. Nobody else - a forward master, DP, editor, director - have they noticed or are not expecting that they look so crazy? Even worse, Phantasm III is one unlucky, unlucky joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first movie. Original Phantasm used humor to ease the relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to create countless inexpensive jokes about Reggie's anger: several refer to films "flying balls" ha-ha, oh, I get the balls. Perhaps the crew got a kick from these jokes, but they're up to us.
