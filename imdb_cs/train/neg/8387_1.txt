It was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People who get into the head are not funny. People who dig are not funny. After the third boy he kicked the balls, and the youngest member of the listener no longer laughed. I just got tired fast. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She really laughed at King of the Hill, but this film was poisoned. I'm not surprised. The story is nice. A tiny thief steals a big diamond in what was certainly the easiest robbery in Hollywood history. Then he's hiding with a family pretending to be a child. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say the two lines again and again for 1.5 hours and get a picture. There were predictable jokes. I really felt as if I could see it. I did not expect much and was still disappointed. I wish Keenan hired some decent writers to write jokes and / or his other script. It was even worse than White Chicks, if possible. I have seen games at colleges that have been better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my fun to be overwhelming.
