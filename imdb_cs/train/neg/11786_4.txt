The show had great episodes, not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's hard to watch "The Man Who Was Death," "The Whole House," and "Dig Out the Cat, It's Really Out". This episode is about a couple who just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you will find that Charles just marries Peggy for money. Two go on a honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirty path and has to seek refuge in an old abandoned estate. Charles soon finds out the secret of the Peggy family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the other episodes in the first season.
