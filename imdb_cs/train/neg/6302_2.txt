British movie "Heritage" is out of control. There is nothing wrong with the filming of classic novels, but why do they all have to make hopeless nobodies? This film breaks the courage of the hard novel of Orwell and turns it into a harmless romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" does not have to be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget his wonderful display of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only coldness and hunger but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a mild, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for the bomber squadron to turn away. But this film does something that could be disturbing and instead creates a funny nostalgic trip to the enchanting London of the 1930s where everything is illuminated by the golden sunlight shafts and even the Lambeth slums are picturesque and filled with freshly cleaned hedgehogs and happy prostitutes . Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping through the streets that have broken down to garbage seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. The worst of all is the absurd scenario bonhomie, the ancient jokes, and the talkative dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect guy playing Gordon Comstock and the movie is full of great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! British literary history is something to boast of its richness, complexity and strength. And what are we doing? We use inconspicuous nobodies to change into a soft, anodine beam for people who want to feel "getting a culture" while drinking their Horlics and moving quietly.
