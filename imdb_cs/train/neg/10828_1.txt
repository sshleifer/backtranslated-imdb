This is not only my considered verdict about this film, but also what has been written about it. Do not let me go wrong, I'm not a complete philistine, I did not hate the movie, because it was not like "police academy 9" or anything else, I enjoy more than my fair share of high head or story, I swear. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is poor and I am sincerely curious why it is so far recognized. Long, smug, stinky nonsense from beginning to end, there is so little that could be credibly what people so love about the movie. Some high quality actors are cautious and none of them will change in average or worse performance. In addition, my wife (admitted Tom Cruise hater) tells me that it is his best career. But plotting is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely coupled characters in such a snail's tempo that even if significant events of life change are shown, it seems so unnecessary and uninteresting, you find that you are screaming for someone to blow off or something. <br /> <br /> It does not help to make any of the characters too easy to identify or empathize (I did not think well, but most people do not like it). All of them all play their rather non-binding life stories at length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-complicated details and playing their deep and meaningful n-degree relationships with many wafling soliloquy on the way. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also terrible, with such irritating quality that I have always considered to be the unique music of Alanis Morisette. Overall, it was about so pleasant that three hours were forced to watch the episode of "Friends" repeatedly while they were intermittently crumpled in the ripples of the disgruntled goat of the nanny. But the frog is good.
