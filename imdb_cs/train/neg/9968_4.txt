As a former teacher (!) I have to confess that they are revolving around many scenes - "although I kept looking at the end, I wonder why ?! Initial scenes seemed incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed, although there were some good ideas, such as the situation of a facilitating teacher, not concentrated enough in any direction for classroom development. <br /> <br /> Not one of Mr. Nolte's most beautiful When it comes to young Mr. Macchia, it speaks like this in * every * movie? <br /> <br /> Plot and dealing with complaints aside, hair-styles lonely was a nostalgic (if tireless) trip. <br /> <br />
