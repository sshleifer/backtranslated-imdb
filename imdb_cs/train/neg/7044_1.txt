How sad it is to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise, who becomes the horrible apology for the film. Tina still looked good and appealing, but for some reason she looks really scared. I understand her fear; fears that this third degree of killing will be made available in some way to the general public. I'm also a fan of cozy Adam West. Again, just like with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man of his age. His acting is acceptable, but the script is so bad that it's hard to even listen to the dialogue. The film is a reflection of classic Brando biker, The Wild Ones; out-law biker gang is out of control in a small hick-town. The bikers look like a varied group here, and I certainly would not want them to meet their sister. The game is solid and wooden and the story is as old as sand. Hellriders is hell watching!
