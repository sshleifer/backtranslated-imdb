I apologize to my fellow citizens in Nevada, but this is bad. Brian had too many botoxs because he had very little film. <br /> <br /> Alice looked as if she had a board attached to the back. Throughout the movie she was stiff. <br /> <br /> I looked at both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see a great job. I would assume that this is the first year of students. Ed Asner and Peter Jason carried the film with honesty and lightness with each line. Ed certainly did not lose his charisma. I wish I met him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love snow scenes and store scenes and the church because I was there. I make Nevada City home and anxiously await the premiere. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry.
