Some people say that Steve Irwin is a crazy and unclear personality is just an act. Take a look at this movie: it is obvious that he can not act. Steve Irwin, the dangerous star of a small canvas in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and the Crocodile Hunter * series to see the trendline name, or is it just me?), Rockets his bigger-than-strife persona on the big screen * Crocodile Hunter: a collision course * (yup? There is a certain trend of words beginning with 'C') - basically an episode * Crocodile Hunter * pinned together with movie B. <br /> <br /> When moving a big Crocodile to (Magda Szubanski), Steve and Terri do not realize that Croc is being watched by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) to recover from a spy satellite beacon that he has swallowed. Will it hurt my credibility to say "are they on a burglary collision course"? (what the credibility? - Ed note.) The plot is irrelevant because it is Steve's animal magnetism that drives the movie. If you find that his persona is trying, the film is a failure, but if you are a fan of either his (like a businessman, protector or plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-ranging John Stainton, faithful Liege, and a helper from work on Crocodile Hunter * (can be said to have straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that Steve has done wildlife. The most damaging aspect of this film is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can really hear exclamations as he speaks) and Terri (Steve's 10 years, the strongest ally and closest friend) treats it as one of their documents, breaking the "fourth wall" and talking directly with the camera while all the other characters behave as if they were in the bad movie well?). Would not it be so rude if Steve and Terri were kept separate from the other characters? but when bad Americans are constantly threatening Steve's life, we have to realize that the audience must ask themselves why the indifferent camera staff does not call the cops if they do not try to try bad guys in the eyes with the microphones or run into a bush? nothing but to continue filming with great lighting, sharp sound and seven action angles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While Terri is unjustly painted as Steve's slightly incompetent assistant (her acting consists of a courageously wizarding line that reads and gadgets around in pear-shaped buttocks-hugging jeans-at the last, I'm not complaining), Steve goes about his business - as is usual - he shows up and tells the creatures who want to kill him, they do all their pieces themselves, because they are not really stuntmen for them, just a day in the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, observing the koo-koa adventure of this fool after his tragic death in September 2006 reveals a strange separation from acting. But for those of us who have never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as the various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in constant re-run) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile breed. The fact of his absence will only be apparent to those closest to him. And do I really wish them the best in watching in their big footsteps? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this diversion for what it is? half-empty film with full legend. Did he die what he loved? who could work with wildlife - and he would never have to ask for his first feature film to show him just that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
