When I first saw this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York Lucy is totally terrible. Lucille Ball was a stunning comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about the legend Lucille Ball has been portrayed as it was in the movie is scary. I can not believe all the actors in the world who could play much better Lucy, the producers have decided to get Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It's hard to find someone who might resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone like a look and talent. If you've noticed that Lucy Lucy in I Love Lucy's episodes as a chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, there's nothing like it - her expression, voice or movement. To start with everything, Danny Pino plays Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino is not entitled to play as Ricky. He is small and lean, his accent is unreal and his acting is incredible again. Though Fred and Ethel were not alike, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. Overall, it's terribly scary casting and the story is wrong. If people want to understand the real life of Lucille Ball, I recommend watching A & E Biography Lucy and Desi, reading a book by Lucille Ball alone or American Masters PBS: Finding Lucy. If you want to see it, "Before laughing" would be a better choice. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Smiech" is much better compared to this. At least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
