Lorne Michaels again proves that he has absolutely no business that produces movies. Would you think that after such stupid moves as "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" they may not know what they are doing in terms of films (and many would say they do not know what they are doing in terms of television) . I'm trying to make feature films from skits that have welcomed their welcome for the third time on SNL, it makes no sense. I personally like Tim Meadows and I think he would be great in the right film. It's a pity he saw a talented guy who was lost in a movie that is inoperable after an uncomfortable situation, and it all conceals a terrible bad song and a dance scene. Any laughs happen because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. Well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have their movies shot. It's simply bad that it happened on the big screen.
