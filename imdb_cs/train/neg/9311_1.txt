The cover of the DVD and the disc is scary, you think the movie about a sweet tooth made of twisted metallic black, which is still a really great idea but the actors of this movie are the worst, then the performance of Ben's pearl harbor, the porno has better quality and better actors. I'm going to buy a DVD, but fortunately I leased it for the first time, the plot and the script are also terrible, nothing seems together, so the movie really does not make sense. Bad attempts to frighten you with flash scenes are worse than those used in the 80th sitcom and eventually let you want to bang your head against the wall of your home.
