As a writer, I find films so bad that it makes a full slap in the face. Talk about insult. At the eighth year I wrote better stories than this. Bad behavior, bad writing, wrong direction, and when added together, the result is complete and complete. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie can handle is deceiving the unsuspecting consumer into the waste of time. Who would the green light be so badly written? It's not artistic, smart, smart, exciting, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NICI. Characters are flat and boring, no development. The building is recycled as an aluminum container. Somehow they managed to find some very well-known actors who all have to be quite desperate to work or hope one of these low-budget independent films turns out to be another "Pulp Fiction". This script should be used to lick a bird's cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> And last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the power to kill men and women twice its size without fighting and in a single blow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if you were infected with STD.
