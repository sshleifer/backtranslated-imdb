Wow. Some movies let me talk. It was undoubtedly one of these films. When I left the theater, no word came to me. All I had was an incredible urge to take my head to the theater wall and help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately it did not work. Frankly, this film has nothing to recommend. Humor was at the first level, at best, acting was too stupid, and the conspiracy was astronomical enough. I hear the promise never to see another movie with Chris Katt or another SNL member.
