What "Noise" can not do is understand his character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer deal with the city's disturbing sounds, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie that has so much creative credibility as "Death Wish". She is clever in places; especially the scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel, "I'm too stupid to understand." Read and re-read the paragraphs in confusion, we read it and we will not get one. Only then the car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie, the city's alarms and noise are permanently interrupted. Though it does little to help us understand our hero, which allows everyone to destroy his marriage and disperse with side drawings rather than dig deep into his personality. <br /> <br /> The film itself is too unconscious to notice its own sound problems, poor editing and visible booms. No, "Noise" is not bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end will not fall. In general, it drives a logistical point home from which you probably did not think. At least I did not. Although it was ninety minutes in total, it could not have ended earlier. The story stretched and seemed to be lost as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> This is another of those movies you can see at the Film Festival, but you probably will not be picked up for distribution. Try it on DVD if you are really partial to someone who is involved in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
