This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While with good actors the film does not meet expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is music that basically sums up the film: it compensates for a bad and confusing story by having famous actors, loud and dramatic music. This does not change the fact that it is a very boring film to watch. He scored 1.
