It's absolutely unbelievable that anyone could make a note that this film is not a sermon. It is not just a compulsive sermon, but an absurd, stupid, dramatically straight and painfully overthrown. When watching this, one feels like an eight-year-old child who is punished by writing 100 times "I will not become a fascist" on the board. Now I understand that it happened during the height of the Second World War and was supposed to be a courageous condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he caused (which would be somewhat delightful) and I'm sure he has just captured the mood of today. But it is presented in such an immature, obvious way that it can not be almost as a work of art. The only good performances are from Paul Lukas, who brings his sincerity and intensity as a heroically anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as a wonderfully crazy rich grandmother who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their crazy education has made all kinds of difficulties, children are ridiculously portrayed as robotically well-groomed little snips. They are even remotely resembling real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, is as nonsensical as I ever touched the screen. Her every word, every gesture, is supposed to explain how it is SUPPORTING and CONTINUES that it's the SORIFICE her husband is supposed to do, and the big cause she fights for that she has to be involved to get a painful electric shock, it's a very important film, just not very good.
