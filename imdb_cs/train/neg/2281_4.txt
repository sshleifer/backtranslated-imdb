Think of the "stages of the game". It is worth seeing once for Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Launch Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas of this movie. Are there any vampires in this "Bavarian village", or is it a natural, albeit ominous, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring that is occupied as a particularly crazy character. It's fun to look at his different expressions in the face of what's actually stock. It does not get anymore, but then we find out that Atwill smoker is a real killer. There are too many "comic reliefs", but it is for this time. Fay Wray looks really good.
