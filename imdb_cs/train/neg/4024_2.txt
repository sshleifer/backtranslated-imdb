This movie is just terrible. Poor John Savage had to jump to be in another movie. He played as a rare type of vampire that is to help a girl who looks like a wash out and throws on the street a footman who is a dancer in the local strip of the club. She captivates herself with a drop of blood from another dancer who becomes one of those rare vampires as they move on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned a short leader of this rare vampire breed, which looks like a cross between punk rock of the 80s and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just goes crazy with Savage rap and dancing with a pitcher with a tattoo spider on his head, one of the rare ones. He cites Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just had to laugh. This is just a rediscovery. And the most harsh special effects they could come up with are Corri throwing her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can say it's all fake. Her son does not know what to do with her new mummy and becomes more a pest than an object of equanimity. I like a good movie about vampires, believe me I'm doing it, but I just got it wrong. Even photographs make, capture and radiate, the camera switches and tries to look as if the vampires move into the camera to keep moving, and then the camera turns around in a bright Savage scene, from Corri, until it gets stuck. Avoid this!
