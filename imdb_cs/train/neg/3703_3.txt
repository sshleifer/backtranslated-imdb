I did not expect much from this movie, but boy-boy, I did not expect this movie to be so bad. Chris Rock does not show good performance here, you can not feel that his character is real, I think the movie would be a bit better if it was a track or a romantic scene would be a minor part of the movie and more / better humor was involved. The film, like film makers, had a bad hangover. They do not show a single smile in "making". This is a very bad movie! I gave him three out of ten because of the few smiles he gave me, but I never smiled!
