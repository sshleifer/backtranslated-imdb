Cabin Fever is the first feature film of director Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote the story from Roth's story. This zombie film, which owes a lot to George Romero and his former "live dead movies," and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot mentioned Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead". There is nothing original and the story is not convincing. acting is about the same as this genre, it's just that the story fails. and he said that after he achieved the commercial, non-artistic success of this film, Roth decided he was a director and came up with a terrible, dirty, unnecessary (though much more ambitious) disgusting Guest Hostel. Roth should stop while he was behind him. Cafin Fever is not a good movie, however, compared to Hostel's artwork. I hope someone (best psychiatrist) convinces the guy that the film is a bad career. Fever in the cabin, weak 3/10 for not being as rewarding as the Hostel.
