I can not believe how horrible this movie was. I feel generous even to refer to it as a "movie". The game was flat, editing was terrible, and the conspiracy leaves many crucial questions unanswered. The assumption was OK, if indefinite: a small group of foreigners live in the US and try to slowly take over humanity. But from there it goes quickly down the hill. How could they persuade a "man" to accept a stranger as his wife to acquire the foreign human hybrid they require? They show aliens larvae, but they never show what they are doing. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce the perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. He throws a mandatory huge monster with his teeth. The end was almost too painful to look at. I suppose I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have something to do with it. How could he say to a giant extraterrestrial monster, "Get away from him, son of God," with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon for 5 days. Avoid it at all costs.
