This ghost of Kiyoshi Kurosawa is quite wild and he has at least one fear that struck me. Overall, the film is incredibly stupid, and the detective tries to trace the suspect serial killer just to find out that he has committed one of the crimes. Then she finds himself in the terrible spirit of the Asian lady and has no idea why (and not even the viewer). Just as other murders are committed, it is even more confused because the murderers are easy to find, and this spirit is, for some reason, increasingly horrible. Not only is the plot totally stupid, the ladies' spirit is more fun than anything else, especially when it suddenly flies across the city like Wonder Woman. The end does not make sense, in fact, the whole movie does not make sense and I can not recommend it at all. If it were not so serious, I thought it was going to be a black comedy. Outside of "Bright Future," it's the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that I've seen.
