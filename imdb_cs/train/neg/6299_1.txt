This unsettled adaptation of probably one of Martin Amis's weaker novels can not even compare with other drug speeches such as Requiem For a Dream or something Irvine Walsh wrote as he tries to decide whether it is a cartoon of slap-stick or hyperrealistic hallucination. Boringly controlled by William Marsh in excessively saturated shades, a group of school leavers gather in a house that awaits the appearance of three American friends at the weekend of decadent drug use. And that's all. In addition to the absurd bitterness that will soon become the main conspiracy, there is an extremist culture that is manifested by violent murders of elite personalities of the world, whether political or pampered. Within the first reel, you know exactly where it is going. What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany doing in this tiring, badly pitched hole? Made before his rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly, it is certain that if he was offered this waste he would immediately change agents! Avoid.
