DO NOT USE THIS FILM SAMPLE FOR SALE. I've lost time and money on it, and I'm pretty good at it. <br /> <br /> This is comparable to high school games. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes after the end (which I believe I should be rewarded for achieving), I had the headache of all shouting, crying and crying the five girls to do. Most of the violence is (rather rare for the film nowadays) suggested rather than graphically related, but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and indeed every person involved in the creation of this work dies in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> I spend another ten minutes of my life saving you from very bad 100 minutes. Do not do it.
