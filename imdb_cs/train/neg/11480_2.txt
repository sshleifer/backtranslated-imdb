I watched it with my girlfriend after I stepped on her when I switched on the channels. I think we both hoped we'd have some happy family cute Christmas movie, but they were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> An actor playing a soldier seems to have an emotion, his face looks the same, whether he is cutting a Christmas tree, sees the girl he loves when her boyfriend kisses her, or when he is happily surprised the girl he loves is a terrible actor and none of us did anything but laugh at him. Then there is a cute blonde, blessed with the ability to count the dots and cheat on her friend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more points. So it's basically a story about a guy without any emotions or feelings falling down on a guy who counts dots and cheating on his boyfriend, it's as predictable as it gets, and he's really wasting time, you have nothing when you're watching, other than some weird laugh because it's so furious. I love it when my father says he's eating French fries and not French wine and everyone laughs, that's the hillbilly attitude of this movie is about if my daddy's friends tease me around like I said something to him or not, but not our army veteran, not sir, let him all boss. The film is what would be the first blood if John Rambo burned as the greatest werewolf in the world.
