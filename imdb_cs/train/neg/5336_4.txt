This movie is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. He has a very small conspiracy, mostly party, beer, and beer. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are unnecessary. I do not know why they did this movie. You could say that Elvis was also useless, is much better in "Watch that dream".
