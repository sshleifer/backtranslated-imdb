Tierney is a real hard guy, but this loss of film from a normally competent RKO undermines his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at the dinner of ten cimbals. Just count the times when Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one chilling excuse after another for their devious and violent deeds. The old clich√© about "just happening in movies" is used here in spades. Then there's the guy who plays the guy who seems to have fought from the comedy comedy WC Fields and destroyed the terrible mood. Static one-room sets do not even help, and director Feist apparently does not feel it's material. Then add the final car of persecution that is missing both imagination and payout, and the result is quite flat. In fact, the film only rises in station scenes, where hard-pressed police officers discover the hidden forces of innocent-looking service station servicemen. It's a shame that Tieney's career never worked. I found out that it was mainly because I was so heavy and meager, so I got into one dirty scratch after another. His ice cold way and the clarity of emotion remind me of Lee Marvin in his tough guy. Anyway, this project could work as a radio game, but as a movie with the promising name of noir, it's disappointing.
