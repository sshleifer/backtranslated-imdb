The film is almost ridiculous when Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters work as mothers of convicted murderers. With enormous reputation after the experiment, both women joined together and set off from NY to California to open and sang and sang a studio for girls like Shirley Temple. From the beginning it turns out that Reynolds made a mistake when she and Winters brought her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems to be getting more out of her rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women who live together get terrible phone calls. Reynolds, who gives a blond wig, is soon conceived by the wealthy father of one of his students who plays well Dennis Weaver. Agnes Moorehead, in one of the last films, is shortly considered Sister Alma, Winters is a loyal listener. The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. It's heavy here, and it seemed to work even better. Winters always worked well in the roles that tried her nerves. The end is unnecessary and who can forget about Winters on the piano, who is wandering with that crazy look?
