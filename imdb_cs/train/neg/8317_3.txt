For the movie about the killer it's surprisingly boring. Nothing happens and even if it happens, they do not bring any real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> Good on both guides, Cassetti especially delivers great performance combining the confidence and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the cast also do what they need. The problem is that writing is bad, and the fact that it's not a real story, Succo is not a unique figure, it is neither interesting nor exciting. Films of this kind usually try to create tension or empathy or outrage, and it does nothing except a feeling of regret that you spend your time unnecessarily watching.
