All right, especially Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was the television program "The Crocodile Hunter" with bad gambling, bad scenarios, and the wrong direction between Steve, who caught or taught us about animals. He has been entertaining as a search / specialist for animals. Millions will be missed. But the whole idea of ​​the film was a big mistake. The conspiracy was so broken, it almost did not exist. Casting was terrible. There was no effect on elementary school students. The direction must also be damaged. If you can not get a decent performance from your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you do not have to be so good first and foremost. I could write a better script. I wish I never saw this movie. Of course, I watched it for 3 dollars ($ 1.50 for me, 1.50 for my son.) While with friends who insisted on seeing it instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the film, but he never asked to see it again. If you want to remember Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie as a plague. If I were Steve, I know I would not want to be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie!
