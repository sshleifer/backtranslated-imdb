how can you take it on your hard, lively, flamboyant story of a hunter of gratitude seriously * with that * accent? It's absurd. Besides, the visual style of directer is harmless and skillful, the conspiracy is shallow, boring, confused gangster film rehash, and acting is unconvincing. The film brings new characters throughout the movie and is said to be in a fragmented flash - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to make you nice and confused. The film sometimes portrays things that do not really happen, and later says, "It did not happen, it happened" - they see (apparently) the "first ladies" killing (fake). What did we see the first, bad, sequence of events for that? <br /> <br /> A tremendous choice in casting, an intricate, chaotic conspiracy and a headache that creates overhead style. 1/5.
