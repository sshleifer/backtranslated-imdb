Damage. That's all I have to say about this sorry about the movie. It's going. It's going. It's going. I mean what the hell is he thinking? Contractual idiots should never be able to make more movies. The game was so bad that it even did not manage to have fun at the wrong level. The "lesbian scene" attempt was sad. I feel so bad for the ladies who were concerned. This movie is upset! Sucks! He listened! <br /> <br /> I heard about the rumors about the sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help us <br /> <br /> <br /> All
