Although I had some hope for this film, especially because I really like Jason Segel's (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) acting, I must say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in the recent memory (Loser and Dr T and Women are also on this list). Yes, the couple laughed aloud, although the film could have been much better. The premise was not for bad artists who were cheating on a journey through college to meet their struggle when someone who offered them an offer discovered it. The problem is that the characters were so indestructible that I did not care about anyone. The teaser (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it was not so ridiculous to look at him - he was not bothered by a particularly entertaining or enchanting way; he was just a mad loser who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the film was hard to watch - it was still changing between fantasy and reality, and it was often unclear what it was. Only two or three of the gang frauds were actually shown, it was just the belief that they are really underwater artists - it shows that their plans would lead to a better film. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was stupid and ill-written and directed. I could continue the shortcomings of the movie, but you get the idea. They are not worth renting $ 4 or for gas that is needed to ride to and from the movie store for rent!
