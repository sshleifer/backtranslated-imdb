To be honest, I knew what to expect before I was watching this movie, and I must say that it has the worst acting I've ever seen. It has its moments and it's very fun at the comedy level, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is brought to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is everywhere. I do not know why the aliens were bad and why they even got to this remote part of Wales (I mean who would go there?) But at this moment I did not care because I was entertained by the costumes and the bad CGI. As far as B-type films are concerned, it deserves the title "To be so bad, good" and to the film makers because they probably know what they are doing. For a long time these films can continue .....
