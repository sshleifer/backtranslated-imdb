I've rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer I thought this movie might be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... all!" said the trailer. Well ... that offended me because this movie is upset. It's hardly a comedy because I laughed for about two seconds throughout the movie. And what about all the homosexuals in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have a problem with who they are, but how does it make sense to add so many gay scenes in a so-called comedy movie when these scenes are not really fun? I think the director is a homosexual rejection or something like that. So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go to the good comedy you've seen a million times, you'll be better off watching this comedy mother. It's really total bullshit.
