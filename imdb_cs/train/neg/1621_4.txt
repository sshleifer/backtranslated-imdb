"Fox and the Child" is a new film by French director Luco Jacquet, who brought us an Oscar movie "March of the Penguins." It focuses on a young girl (played well by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her blooming friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are really charming moments here; the badgers were moving, lynx pursued the fox through the snowy forest; one scene, especially when a fox is a wolf-lover, is rather intense and sometimes scary. However, there simply is not enough. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot; cinematography is brilliant. The bubbly appearance of the film is amazing. It is undoubtedly a very fresh production. The English version is told by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue there was badly dubbed. The score is also too hazy, or at least it is for my taste; and the script, though the gentle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, eventually left me almost confused. While the heart of the film is a nice morale, and the silent performance of Noël-Bruneau is really beautiful, the real star is a fox. These enchanting moments, which focus exclusively on our hairy friend, are enormous. But again, it's simply not enough. <br /> <br /> - If you are aware of all the latest movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray. com.au
