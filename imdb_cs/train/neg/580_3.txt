A really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and the poor works as an add-on. This vampire story hunter is the worst I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), traveling to Mexico looking for a blood feeder! Does he use some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to the Blade) and is part of some vampire hunters from Van Helsigo? OK, but works alone. It is designed to haunt a powerful vampire queen looking for a black crucifix to perform a ritual that makes it vulnerable to sunlight (it's almost a sequel to John Carpenter's vampires (1998) and James Woods) Derek is starting to look for a queen with her new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, a really bad actor), carefree teenager, Father Rodrigo (Catholic priest Cristian De la Fuente), Zoey (Natasha Wagner) special vampire, and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) So of course in this adventure it's not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this movie would look at its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); there's a huge difference in actor-quality compared to James Woods, and then, if you're watching the movie (I do not recommend this part), you'll be involved in one of the easiest stories, totally predictable, with terrifying acting performances, really bad special effects and disjointed events! <br /> <br /> I deeply recommend not seeing this movie, borrowing another movie, seeing another channel, going with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
