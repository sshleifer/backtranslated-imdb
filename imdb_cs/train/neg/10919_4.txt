The Bollywood fans basically held Marda Amitabh Bachan in a great way, but I think he is overvalued. Manmohan Desai has previously collaborated with films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I saw everyone I liked, so I had a very high expectation before watching Mard and being bitterly disappointed. My main mystery about Mard is that he feels like Amar Akbar Anthony Part 2, perhaps that Mr. Desai has run away from his thoughts, after all he has been using this formula for years and years. 1. First, some members are recruited by AAA, such as the police inspector who brings Amar, a Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirup Roy and several others. 2. In AAA Nirup Roy loses sight, loses her voice in Mard 3. In the AAA there is a famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) and in Marda we have Amitabh singing Ma Sherawali. When I saw the AAA more than 1000 times, I noticed that right now. <br /> <br /> My other bouts are that some situations seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai left your brain at the door of such films, but with Mard I thought he was going too far. My last understanding is that compared to the songs in previous films, Manmohan Desai, I found the songs rather unsatisfactory. I know he has a lot of fans who swear, but I did not like it. In fact, it hurt me to write this review because I was such a huge fan and I loved my films since I was a child.
