I have to admit that I have seen some myths in my time, but this one is the worst. The harassment follows. Sex and violence, which have faded from scattering and turning away from a really poorly assembled film. I can only imagine that the cast will look back at the end product and wish him to collect the dust on the shelf, be disturbed for one or two generations. Unfortunately, in my case, I have a DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
