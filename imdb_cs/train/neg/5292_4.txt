I can not recommend this movie as the date of the movie. The semi-autobiographical description of Gary Oldman's life living in the South East London Estate is the sincere Beckettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell. In the middle of it is Ray Winstone, who made this character before, but never the same. The film opens with him and orders drinks in the bar - that's all - and you are already grabbed by the excitement of frustration, self-confidence and barbarity that he exposes in many different ways throughout the movie. It's an acting master class. Of course, stammers and exclusives need a film in a drama like this and Winstone is associated with Kathy Burkem as his long-standing wife who absorbs and eventually rejects his intolerable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles makes a good turn as a synthesizer, Billy, though he has ever had to convince himself, exactly what he left for himself. Gary Oldman directs close actors, maximizing claustrophobia for their advice. 4/10
