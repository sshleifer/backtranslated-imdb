I read the back of the box and spoke about Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Wonderful, it'll be great!" I was so bad. The story was destroyed. In fact, I still do not. It seems to me that all the characters were drinking, smoke (opium?) And sex. Not that they are not good movies, but please! Where was the story? I did the film to finish, and yes, it was up, but then the movie was almost over. Rent her if you really want to. Just do not believe the back of the box.
