I'm absolutely horrified when I see that the average rating of this movie is 5.2 / 10. What is affecting me is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and yet I still wonder why I've been watching it all the way. First, the conspiracy is utterly hopeless, and acting is really terrible. I think a completely unknown actress would be better for a role than Susan Lucci; with regard to Mr. Kamar Del Reyese, I think it would be better if he stayed in the "Lower Panels". A summary, it's a complete waste of time (and I try to stay polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but because we can not give O ....
