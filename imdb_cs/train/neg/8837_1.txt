This movie is terrible. I really enjoyed this because I thought the "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> The following reviews may include * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, good things: looks great, some performances are all right . Bad things are all about it. The story, you may know, is about some guy who go fishing and discover the body with the spin they find on Friday, but they continue fishing and finally inform about it on Sunday when they return to their mobile phone. The film, however, insists that time is coming to this central event (boys take it). From a set of characters (about a dozen) it seems that nobody likes another (which is, I suppose they are consistent because they are all inconceivable). I was extremely frustrated by failing to adequately explain how the characters are related, and by the end of the film I could make a vague pedigree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a movie that is cruelly cruel, which is a failure in the structure of the story, because the lives of the character seem just as bad before the fishing trip as it is after. Once you set the bar so high, it's hard not to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> There are stupid outages in logic. A killer sets off his body in the lake, and then somehow submerges miles upstream into the mountains. The fishermen leave Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne returns home late at night after his wife went to bed. Then the first morning the police officers attack the door to bring him to the station. Could not they hear the phone? Below the station the media learn the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body? <br /> <br /> Totally absent from the story is the debate blockes definitely had after finding the body. It's a secret - they all ask, "How could you do that?" and the audience is asking the same question. (Talk about what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what to do in their situation. Someone has to go out into the car, go to the mobile reach, call the police, wait, and take them back to the place. If others are waiting for camp and fish, who cares? Many of this seems to be untrue. The only thing that was true was that when the girl was black, local natives were engaged in fishing activities as racists - "it would not be if it was a white girl." <br /> <br /> All the while there is a curious indifference to who could kill the girl (I think it's a topic mentioned once) and it's not a secret because the viewer sees the killer in the opening scene. /> <br /> So I'm sitting there, at the same time, bored and confused when it's a twist - not a conspiracy, but a theme. Suddenly the silent dignity of the abandoned natives becomes, leading to an absurd end with disjointed things about black and white reconciliation. Huh? This is an Australian film "at its best" by age.
