The "House of Games" task is the strongest thing: a successful author and a psychologist is punished by a group of fools, but when he discovers his ominous part, who is excited about what they are doing, he eventually takes revenge. It's on the pitch: but somebody has to take responsibility for seeing them as puppets. It must be director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has a diverse and fairly stable TV and film career, so it can not be that bad. She should go out of a steady, cool, controlled professional to calculate, a bad quick lady to have fun, as shown by a change from a beige suit suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including lingerie) to floppy floral sundress. It seems that everyone is talking about their lines in such a sharp, precise way; Imagining that Mamet wanted to make sure that no syllable of his scintillation script was getting. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of secrets and tensions that are likely to be created. Sometimes the "House of Games" loses any connection with how human beings actually behave or speak, and will only become a mechanism to rebut the plot. Special vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack also does not help. The ultimate result is that the only fun you have to have is to guess the outcome, and the sooner you do it, the sooner you are bored with robotic, two-dimensional performances. And he smokes too much!
