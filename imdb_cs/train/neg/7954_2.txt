Ok this movie was really "unique," we say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, although she says she had a coke problem during the film. but she said she did not remember much. well that's her excuse, but what's everyone else ??? I can not imagine everyone had a coke problem. Though it was not all bad, I think I think it was all right and it had some pretty fun moments. although the part where one gets the thing he put in his head was a bit too violent for my taste. oh, and I think I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so amazing and this film did not do anything for her.
