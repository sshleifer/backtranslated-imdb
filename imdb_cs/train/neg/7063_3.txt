The guy did a lot of titles for a pile of films, and I think he said someday; I should choose a cheap script, try to put as much title as a can (because I'm ultimately a title designer) and try to convince people that it's really a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen is certain. If you've been trying to see pretty titles, make sure that some posters do not waste time tracking it. It's a little ironic, do not you think you saw a poster? the only part of his project, which SHOULD perform the title work, has almost none!
