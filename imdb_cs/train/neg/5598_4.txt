He saw it on the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. What can I say? Against my better judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that acting was a bit ... weak (mostly I noticed from a teenage boy's family). I think the script was not starry, but the actors did not trust me. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I'm libilo to it The characters are sympathetic and the fence is neither demanding nor disturbing. It's sweet, the characters take care of themselves, and I do not count on the fifty minutes of the bad ones. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
