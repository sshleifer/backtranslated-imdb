This was simply a terrible disappointment. The worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly clumsy; I could not feel any feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too fast and felt rather in place. They were equally well cited by sculptures. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susanna York did not exist, and he watched as the American Rochester felt weird. He could at least try to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it just does not work. It seemed to me that I was looking at Jane Eyre, where the main stories were randomly compiled regardless of the story flow. The scene and the music were all very nice but I did not feel any passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester, and the film left me totally unchanged. If You Want To See Good Version Of Jane Eyre I recommend watching the BBC 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark or the 1997 version with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two great adjustments.
