It was a blind buy used DVD. Overall, it killed the nice buzzing I went when I hit the game. It's a bubble comedy, but it is. dirty. The conspiracy is ZANI! But the characters do things to each other, which are so tiny and disturbed and comfortably invented I finally found it depressing to watch. Perhaps the box led me to wait for something more than an uneven, fucking caper film. (I know boxing quotes and Oscar nominations mean nothing.)
