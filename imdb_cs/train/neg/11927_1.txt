No doubt the worst film I've ever seen. I have endured to the end, for there must be something here, but not. This conspiracy, when not interested in the clich√©, extends to the point of nonexistence; the dialogue to be on the street is simply stolen; characters never develop beyond sketches; sets are cliches. Even worse is his photography than his director. Also other comments that lead to Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser coming up to the mark; The lives of saints lack their innovations, let alone their depth and shading. In short, their craft. The ruthless editor would probably be able to adorn him on a decent 30-minute show, but in his current form it is the 6th film project realized on a million pounds; disheveled and bloated with his own wishes. Being funded (certainly because of the name Rankin) while other small films are fighting for cash is depressing for the British film industry.
