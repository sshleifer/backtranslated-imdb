Today I visited the Athens cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years), I paid 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US $ total), not to mention gas, popcorn & soda, was asked to return my 3D special glasses after leaving theater and was "forced" to look at what could have been a great 3D movie masterpiece, but it turned out to be just a bad propaganda film of the "Cold War" as no propaganda film I have seen over the last 20 years ... AND IT IS DESIGNED To be a child's film music ... in the name of heaven! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average labor force of the Greek is at most 850 euros per month (about US $ 1050) PS 2 My children liked it ... but then again they are more than children> in Greek: , fools> like the one who wrote the script and the others who did this "3D Shame". <br /> <br /> 3D animation PS3 is fantastic, ....!
