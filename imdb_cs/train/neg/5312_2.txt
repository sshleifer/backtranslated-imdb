Typically, terrible waste from director Fred Oleen Ray about the cyan hunt (Teagan), commissioned by Jan-Michael Vincent, to find and execute the escape of a foreign convicted Ross Hagen who mapped the course of the country. Early Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammams of college children headed by a grid of Richard Wiley who ran through Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone. Soon the cyborg throws away his hands by laser incineration of one innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of the Count of Yorga-Vampire) proving that no one will stand in the way to get the skin of a convict whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body . Law finds allies in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam war veteran with weapons in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps deliberately doing horrible, this is what fans of "ranch cinema" long for ... effects, actions and assumptions. At least, the PJ Soles film for some eye candy .. even in 1989, was quite smokey. This laser gun is certainly funny .. it can burn some houses, but when Cyborg shoots the law, it barely leaves the mark on the spot.
