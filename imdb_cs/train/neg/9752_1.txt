I can not honestly believe what's going on now for fun. Death (sexual violence, sexual violence, teenage children threatening children, brutality, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, healer from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat, children in the middle of the night - Children's film for me - NO! Add dark and frightening elements to it - a dead woman who has and has become a house and has kept her loving husband in prison for more than 20 years and also terrorized the whole neighborhood as sweet to children. it's really what you want your kids to watch - is that what you want them to learn about life? This movie is too scary for young children and I'm afraid that teens may live a movie scenario today - so why do not you to dress in the face? As for the adult audience - you will not find it terrifying or entertaining - just boring, conceived and predictable, and the characters are simply wrong no-cocky parents, ignorant police, stupid and poisonous friends, ugly and manipulative guardians, and beer drinking / loving girlfriends. What great material for kids - does it really sound like a kid's movie to someone? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to redeem this awful move. Save money, save time and save your child's mind - go for the Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Incredibles, Shrek, Bug's Life - EVERYONE is much better than this terrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you that you have made such a disaster and then billed it as a child / family movie!
