This is not a bad movie. Land (a new house built side by side seems to be scary) is not bad, the mood is pretty scary and the acting is fine. The big problem I had was that when I met Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not see how different she looked with her seemingly new big lips. I was still looking at them. They look so impeccable on their faces! They indicate that it looks completely different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actor who plays architect Kim, who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a great job. And Lara (like Col) is also pretty good (but you lips!) As the owner next to the house. Her husband Walker (Colin Ferguson) is suitably wooden. The different characters living in the house were also fine. I really liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to get into the house. Attempting to engage us in the global atmosphere will fail, unfortunately, as the other neighbors are not particularly sympathetic. For some reason, the director was not able to make the "haunted" house a particularly ominous one. Other movies (for example, Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) can achieve that scary feeling, but it just will not happen. The closest is when Coll renders the display of the house. Another thing that did not work for me is a conspiracy plot that happens to Kim, an architect. At first, he appears to have been the victim of a house like the others (exhausted by him inspired), but later he seems to have joined his forces in evil. Overall, it's not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
