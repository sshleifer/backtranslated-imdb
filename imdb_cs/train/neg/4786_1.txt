I despise horror films, that's not a secret. No plot, bad acting and gallons of blood are the basics of these cinema mistakes, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually operate this waste. (As I remembered, this particular waste was dropped straight to video.) As we would mention about any other film, it would be a big offense for this other film, I say: All Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy's movies , Chuck Movies and most of Michael Myers' films can be summarized in one word: TERRIBLE! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
