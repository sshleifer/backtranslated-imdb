Although Bette Davis did WONDERFUL work as Mildred, I felt the film was not the best I saw. At the end of the movie, I felt there was something missing. But Bette Davis did a great job, and she made me hate her and she was flying her all the time. Leslie Howard was very kind as a lover, Philip Carey, so I tried him in the whole movie to fall in love with such a terrible friend. It's so sad when you fall in love with bad seeds. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though poor. Eventually it was what passed, not the story. The final scene was especially good, but I'm not one that would give her away. Though others can find this movie good, I was the one who found it that way. I recommend this film to those who love bad seeds to see what can happen to them if they find themselves in love with this terrible person.
