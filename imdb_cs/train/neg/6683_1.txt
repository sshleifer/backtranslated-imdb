I am glad that the IMDb people have been able to understand the genre of this film. I suspected she was trying to be a comedy, but because she also seemed to be a dark and serious melodrama, I was not sure. For comedy, he is remarkably relieved of the smallest hit in the spheres of humor - until a ridiculous "twist" ends, which confirms the complete loss of time in the whole movie. It's hard to describe how truly amateur is. Did anyone else participate in this film about what they should do? In fact, it's worth watching, so you can look at the screen in a disturbing disbelief about how horrible it is.
