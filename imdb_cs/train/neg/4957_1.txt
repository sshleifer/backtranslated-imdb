I can not believe that some people actually like it. Still, they are still called Batman fans. Even so far as to say it is better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be a plagiarist to use the name of Batman for this piece of crap. It's not about Batman. The whole presumption of the show is, "If you can not beat someone who has a bigger gun to help you" Batman is not about weapons. He uses his batarang and hook and batmobile, that's it. He did not come up with any new ingenious technique every time he could beat someone. I do not know where the hell they got the idea for Batbot. or anything else. They destroyed all the villains. Mr Freeze left the sympathetic scientist for a tiny criminal who had fallen into a rescue. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a silly costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft high hat. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, making Dummy the overall center of the character. They even have a stupid idea to become a giant! WTF? and the two worst character changes are The Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler to a Gothic / retro teenage jester. and Joker on the acrobat with fears. Looks like Bob Marley wannabe. totally and completely destroyed batman and moreso before B & R did! I wish I could meet the creators and writers and animators of this show so that I could fit them in the head with a metal baseball bat.
