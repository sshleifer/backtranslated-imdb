The men in black 2 were a real disappointment to me. While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, it's just not a cure for the bad scenario once it's in production. The film really felt like a "sequel" that played partial events of the first film. The story was in the wrong sense at best. It was not thinking well, and it seemed to be very shattered and discontinuous at times. At the first movement, the MIB organization had an "elite" sense of strength. You had some special agents and it had a "secret" feeling. In continuation, the MIB has a JROTC Summer Camp atmosphere. The film was not horrible, or anything ... just lacked the "cold" (for lack of better phrases) the first movie. Lots of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the other, and there was no originality in the MIB universe. Perfect analogy should be an episode of the first 3 films. Was it decent? Yeah. Is it worthy that this is the title? Not really.
