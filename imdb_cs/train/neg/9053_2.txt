I simply found the television show "Mash" trite, preaching, always always "politically correct", repetitive, demanding and the greatest sin of all, and that is it? that he is (incredibly boring). You have Alan Alda as the lead leader, "(star)" who is so in love with himself and his cleverness that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through the episode. The original series was by McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I will like to admit to having their characteristic presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both individually and together, is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found boring without being guilty in itself, was no wonder what I was looking at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie, was tired and looked like an actress. Seeing one show a year has shown it to me. Jamie Farro was just a low eyebrow comedy and was not even about to mention it at all. The reason why I did not provide (one) rating anyone would read this now would be surprised that the rating of any kind is not just a subjective call but a relative one. Television, except for quite a few exceptions, is so rough. Relatively speaking Mash with some production quality (according to television standards) of that time and today, and therefore deserves two. Rob Ritter
