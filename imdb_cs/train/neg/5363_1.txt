I did not think that this film deserves a bad screenplay, a bad deal except Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, stupid husband, and unjust divorce. If you've never seen this movie before, do not even bother that it's not worth it at all. The only thing that was good was that Janine Turner was doing a good job. Terry's husband is a stuck defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even killed a murderer. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just an eye. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and hurts her. Nice girl what? Yeah, it's a real peach, no. She has no day on the beach.
