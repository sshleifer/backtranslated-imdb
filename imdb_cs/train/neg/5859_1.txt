Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are interested in a global cinema. They are local and folk, but they want to be international. This brings kitsch results like this movie. The film has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and has no meaning for a non-Turkish audience. Even for a Turkish audience after 10 years. Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have worse performance than average. These are puppets. The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing about Cuba. Cuba is therefore thought to be a banana republic. <br /> <br /> The waste of money, the waste of time.
