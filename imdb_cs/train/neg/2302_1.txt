We hear some of the interesting things that our heroes believe, healer Pat, his son Gordon (television service looks like a family business), and Terry Meeuwsen (Miss America in 1973 by wearing swimsuits and showing her legs.) They say when they are our poor spectators are sick and need help. Someone with "abscess right tooth" has just healed. Someone with "twisted intestines" was cured.3.Then Terry said he was a "strange person" (you mean God does not know?) The burning of the legs that just healed. Then Gordon said he was a man (which narrows it down!) With the swelling of the sinuses on his right cheek, with great pain behind his right eye, but he is now healed. Someone with a problematic right hip, limited mobility from stroke, is now able to walk. 6. Terry said she saw someone with severe stiffness in her neck but did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed to the right, especially (not so?) The right side of the face was now healed. The man (who tightens the world's population again.) With a plate in his skull he has constant problems and the doctors just do not know what to do. Terry said she saw bones reforming around the plate (The funny bone ?!) And the pain of the man is gone, he was healed now. This is our war hero, Pat helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it narrows down.) Who has the cavity that the man now drives him to thank Jesus. 2. There is a person with financial need - I think a hundred thousand dollars (I think their god must go to school or something!) We need to meet right now and within three days money will be provided through the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. Thank you Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with lymph node cancer. <br /> <br /> I do not know if she was still diagnosed (Ask your revengeful Pat Pat!), but she did not feel well and the Lord is just dissolving the cancer! (What?!) 4. There is a lady in Saskatoon (I suppose Canada.) In the invalid chair-curvature of the spine, the lord balances that ours right now, and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition to ignore Pat!) Just claim it and it's yours. Thank you, Jesus! Amen, Amen! When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, he went to Peter Popoff, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, Pat was a real physician who had surgery! (Do you think he does not trust his faith to heal his friends, Terry or his own son Gordon ?!) When Lt Pat Robertson was in the navy during the Korean War He was a distillery officer responsible for holding officers supplied with alcohol. He was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes, and feared contacting the hood. (The reason Pat got out of the fight was that his father Absalom Willis Robertson D Va in 1946-66) was chairman of the Senate Military Committee. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> when they had a son!). It is (terrorism) because God is raising our protection from us. (September 13, 2001) Pat Robertson reminds me that Burgermeister about Santa Claus goes to town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Venger on Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> The frozen brother Gordon does what his father says to him, and Terry is a paid woman who does not have her own mind! <br /> <br /> It will really grab you! Critics of the 700 Broadcasting Network, which took place on September 5, 2005, at the New Orleans Convention Center, which was held during the weekend by the most violent victims of black catastrophes. "The few remaining things suggest the idea of ​​some of them." Lane said, "they have this voodoo cup saying" I wish the curse could be with you. "On the screen there was a shot of a plastic souvenir cup from one of New Orleans countless trinkets. Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us, "says Lane, pointing to a pile or rap CD that is scattered on the ground. If one of you good people ever thinks about donating to these sexist fanaticisms, please, in the name of God, we must not sponsor a softball or basketball team, put on a dining table, be a big brother or sister of a child, but please do not do these people because they have been around for over 40 years and solve nothing. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe that Pat Robertson has heard me break a web site during a commercial and hit a search, and once you hear what she really likes, I know you will not give the cents to these vicious liars! And by the way, Terry divorced once, and Pat spoke many times against divorce on his shows. I would like to say hello to the people of Dover, Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida, and the nice people who hit hurricane Katrina and I hope it's a nice day. Was the operative blessing helpful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please inform our readers! I'm doing! By the way, if people are ill, they go to a real doctor and everyone can laugh at these liars, and sometimes Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go somewhere else and take their angry god Venger with them!
