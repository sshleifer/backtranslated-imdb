This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema! I could not wait to finish. To make it worse, you will get a 12A certificate, so you do not see anyone shot, only the bodies that collapsed, even Babban got killed! Too many scenes were cut to bring younger audiences, because I think the creators knew it would be disastrous flop! Amitabh's acting performance was great, but "Basanti" and another idiot who plays Devganse's friend can not even act. Devgan was wrecked! <br /> <br /> I do not want to watch it again for free and I recommend it to everyone else who read it to do the same thing you were warned about !!
