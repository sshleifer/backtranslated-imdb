Three years ago I rented this movie and still in my mind is the worst movie ever. I do not think I ever finished it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember how they recovered something in 1970, and a man with semi-shirts, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV like Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember) appeared in the memory. I do not understand how they could say it was in the 1970s. He could have a cell phone too, I can not remember, it was just terrible. I took him back to a video rental shop and asked them why they even transferred the film and if I could get back an hour of my life. To date, it's the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a few bad guys.
