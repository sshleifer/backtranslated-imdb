It must be the most brutal, dysfunctional "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a crazy homeless CAN I LOVE ME? Something does not have to do with this image. That's the only movie I ever wanted to go. I used free passes and I still felt like I wanted my money back. I can no doubt say that the only film I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF PEACE. The. ONLY. worse. film. I laughed very slightly on the scene with a merry march and that's all. Exploiting 2 hours of something that you will be charged as a comedy should give you more than one laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought the "flan" was a funny word, or something. And the second running joke really takes a dead horse - literally.
