When you think of capture, many words come to mind. These include: uninteresting, irrelevant, incongruous, unsexual, unmovable and unbeatable. I hated those movies from the mid to late nineties, which were basically Scream blasts, but these new Saw babies are starting to make these films look like a classic. Still at the same demographic level that other movies have been so successful, they are now adding a new level of degeneration that makes twelve to fourteen year old girls looking to feel hard and hip. br /> <br /> This movie is a load of boring crap! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been associated with anything good since 1993! Still, I was still surprised to see that he had something to do with something so bad! Was anyone surprised when the film hunting interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Nobody knew when they saw him for the first time? Only someone who has never seen another movie before!
