Amazing, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> A crazy note at the beginning and some ugly autopsy photos are not a good movie. Again, I am overwhelmed by the resolve and skill that some people have in making film productions, yet they have no pride to realize that what they have done is a total stack of bullshit. <br /> <br /> I sat and tried to think about redemption to at least balance my criticism, but the only one I could think about was that the Pink beginner was pretty good ... It seems to me if Did she see it? <br /> <br /> Watch it at your dangers, boredom can kill you.
