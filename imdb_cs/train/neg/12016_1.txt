If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini-series, he would cry. It was a complete waste of time and money. I've read a book and although movies are not exactly what a book can be, CBS needlessly time and money to do it, and it's embarrassing that it was Ludlum's work. It can be a creator to look at Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how well TV series have been. Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica, and Colm, why did they sign up to hide like that? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
