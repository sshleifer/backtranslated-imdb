this movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both and not as good as either.it is also slow and fairly predictable. it also has shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get in the mix some new aging taste, and some of these scenes become motivational / inspirational sermons. Indeed, this movie is almost a swing theme. Although it is terrifying, the effects of makeup are not very realistic. they actually look a little inexpensive. Besides, there is a really horrible clich√© dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point where a few character actions were not true or believable given the circumstances. no one in their right mind what would be like this. when you watch the movie, you will know what I mean. it's also some blameless nudity for nudity sake.it just was not necessary at all.the good news is that acting was really pretty good than this movie deserves s.so, after careful consideration of the evidence, id say this movie was acceptable, but not good. I'm a verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 4/10
