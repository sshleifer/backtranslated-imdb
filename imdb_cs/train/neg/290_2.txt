Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - whether you love it or you hate it. Personally, I like it, but in this fourth movie there is a feeling away. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even actors are not as entertaining. Because that's the only thing that such movies should be - funny. So now that laughing happens, it's unpleasant. They really should not do the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
