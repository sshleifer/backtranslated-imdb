Obviously, all the good reviews that have been made about this film come from insiders who have been involved with the film or who know someone who knows someone and has seen more cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I saw the final cut and it's pure waste. The only thing to do is ambition and multiple portraits of horror legends (none on the screen is terribly long). It's like movie makers filming this weekend during a horror convention and getting actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to shoot the scenes during a coffee break. This is an ultra-cheap, broadcast on the Wannabe X-Files video, with terrible talk of casting non-actors with more than a millet than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it is all too explicit a dialogue that attempts to explain a senseless plot. Computer FX computers are a joke, but they are not enough to make this movie a pleasant MST3K. After about 8 straight scenarios that do not mean anything you are talking about, you will find that you get to the fast forward button ... and will not leave. Absolutely worthless.
