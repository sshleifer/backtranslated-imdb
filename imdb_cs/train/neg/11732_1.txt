IMDb guidelines indicate that you have to tell if your comments contain "spoilers". that the whole movie is something like a spoiler ... a warning story that celebrates what warns against, the story of a lost youth who does not know where to go. <br /> <br /> I just saw it at the tribeca film festival. this movie was not just bad, it was really bad. acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√©s with little depth, and farnsworth's acting was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From patronizing accents to a purposeless line of fences to "graphic" elements out of place, to recurring dialogues and scenarios ... it sucks big. I think he was looking for some sort of nervous, up-to-date "cowboy chemist" with a touch of "naturalborn murderers," but it's not a place where he is as sensitive to characters as the former, and not as shocking (apart from a phrase gore) as a ladder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> /> with a decent subject ... if he does.) B) Edit the movie. if it was reduced to the core, it could be acceptable. <br /> <br /> I would go lower than 1 if I could ... as perhaps Zero Kelvin.
