I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end I was bored and disbelieving. The first shot is feeding a camera from a robot that moves towards the bomb and is naturally restless. But the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even in quiet conversational moments, to the point of absurdity. Do they have leased stands and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot at 16 mm does not help because the whole film is grainy and restless. <br /> <br /> For all the effort that Bigelow has brought to precision vehicles and equipment, there are plenty of sharp mistakes and discrepancies that undermine the credibility of the movie. <br /> <br /> - The car would not explode in a single shot and once it would not be extinguished by a small hand-held fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - One Humvee would not go to Baghdad in 2004 but would be supported by other vehicles in case of a breakdown or attack. - It would be extremely unlikely that it would be possible to hit a long-distance rebel, where the bullet would take a second to reach the goal. <br /> <br /> - I believe that the bombs were brought to designated locations for clearance on or near the base, not some random site in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - An attack on an oil tanker is in the Green Zone, a very safe area where very few attacks have occurred from the inside. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with several settlements, but is portrayed as a dangerous war of dark streets and lurking rebels. Still weird, James is never in trouble for the ridiculous tactics of ordering his two companions to each one of them take one alley for himself, triggering a kidnapping attempt. <br /> <br /> - When we talk about it, a team of 3-men is always shown to clean up buildings, persecute insurgents, etc., even though there are clearly dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to look at the dead insurgent who hangs on the window to find out he does not pretend? <br /> <br /> There were no pictures to show the viewer, what was the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was in the relationship. I had no idea who the EOD team reported, nor were any other characters exhausted. These are the things the characters would know, so we should. Many "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that a psychiatrist colonel is in trouble with the Iraqis trying to make a difference that the choice of grain home will be overwhelming and that the driver you have been kidnaping will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. </ p> <p> <br /> Finally, there was almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character has a problematic relationship at home from the beginning, he is ruthless and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is it? <br /> <br /> If it's really the best of Iraqi war films, it's a ugly bunch. Just for half an hour I've seen, I would recommend Generation Kill to HBO instead.
