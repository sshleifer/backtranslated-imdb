This is not one of the better Arbuckle or Keaton movies, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all her heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanatorium where the psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have guaranteed treatment! Well, once, Arbuckle accidentally snores the thermometer and gets to the surgery. Then he escapes and is persecuted around the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the employee's chase, he escapes, at which point it is clear that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon caught up. However, he wakes up and everything after the surgery is all dream - there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton is not as big incompetent as it seemed in a dream. humor is the biggest film problem. Sure, making fun of mentally ill people is relatively low, but laughter was guaranteed in his days. I would also laugh if it was just something of laughter! A lot of energy and that's all. FYI - During one of the sequencing sequences, Fatty wonders in a race for men over Â£ 200 (how is it?). And shortly thereafter he stood in a place where the number 5 was freshly painted. As a result, five are now on the back of the Fatty T-shirt and look like a regular participant. The number should, however, appear back on Fatty's shirt, but it has come out before them - a mistake, because they should realize that the mirror image would be backward.
