The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one woman outside the Broadway show is frankly demanding. Sandra spoofs lounges and superstars, but her sense of irony is just interesting and absolutely funny. Her fans will say she is harshly honest, and that may be true. But she is also scary, with a bold, bravado face that is not suitable for a movie in this genre. She does not want to love - and she definitely is not for friends - and it will always throw a lot of people wrong. But even if you meet her half, her material is really missing. Film director Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer, and despite his directing, the film has its own cool, separate signature style. Bernhard co-wrote a show with director John Boskovich; their most common touch was that everyone in Sandruv's in-house audiences looked completely bored - the feeling that most true audiences are likely to share. * 1/2 from ****
