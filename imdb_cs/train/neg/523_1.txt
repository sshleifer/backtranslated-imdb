It's amazing what's going on for fun today. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the 1950s and I'm in touch with today's generation of movies, and that's probably the case for this movie because so many people loved it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I did not say about many movies in my life, but this account is good. Humor is sophomoric and raw. I'm not a politically correct person and even found gay jokes, not only fun but totally offensive (I'm not gay). The main figure in the movie is not a pleasant person, just pathetic. When the film finally ended, I heard how many people comment on how disappointed they were in what they just paid for seeing good money.
