This movie was screened as part of the Sydney Mardi Gras 2007 Film Festival. I did not expect the movie as someone selected for me. <br /> <br /> Actually, I love movies that are evolving in time, movies that allow the characters to evolve and allow a story. It's still good. But this movie was just slow. <br /> <br /> Credit has to be paid to two main actors. There was a feeling of tension among them, because two completely different people, really bad people, were united in a very unpleasant way. There were sad moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and way of shooting. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, adding to the intimacy of the film and strengthening the peculiarity of the characters. I just do not get the end. What was the reason for all this?
