I saw the movie as a child when he was released in the theater and it was so bad that he became a model of a family joke. If the rating was zero, it would have won this movie. Dinosaurs were terrible. The story was ridiculous. The performer does not really meet the conditions to call it a negotiation. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is that my family still talks about how bad it is.
