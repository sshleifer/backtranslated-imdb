the film was soaked, it was not funny, it was not exciting. they tried to do it so badly that it was good, but it failed. and he thought it great when he likes this movie next to hype, these are the only reasons why this movie is successful ... the fact that currently 50% voted 10 out of 10 for this movie seems to me rather disgusting, whether it's a public movie, it's crazy or this vote is unrealistic, which can have many causes and should be solved. it's less than the average movie that blossomed from mouth to mouth. His success can only be described as a marketing miracle.
