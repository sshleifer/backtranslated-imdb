The Weissmuller Tarzan finals are relatively weak. There are a few things that scare the movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends most of the film on himself with floppy sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether sandals or shoes as ever portrayed, drives away from the character to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the character of Benji, as mentioned in the previous article, completely derails the film as a comic foil. For me his character is unnecessary for a movie fence. Also, while Weissmuller still takes commander as Tarzan, it is obvious that he was not in his best form. Although in his later Jungle Jim films, his character somehow improved from this film. The Battle of the Octopus is a great idea, but I think it was supposed to be done in an earlier Weissmuller film when it was its physical peak. Likewise, a battle that lasts only 30 seconds would be very exciting if it was fired for 90 seconds for 2 minutes as a classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and his Mate. Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are greatly pleasing to the eye, can not save this latest Weissmuller's film - the unsatisfactory ending of a great character.
