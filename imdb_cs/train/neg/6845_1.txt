"I went to the cinema, saw" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was quite" clean "," Krush Groove "was a movie that did not bother me, but when it came to Rappin, I pulled the line. . <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? This is just a small sample of Rhythm-style Rhyme style on display in this movie waste and site clearance. This movie is really frantic (that's the 80's - we just talk about being f * cking terrible). As an emcee, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of a bodybuilder. Each film, called "Rappin," should better suit the highest standard of this genre. So why are they six years in the alley, even on the day the standards were so high that ... "Webster" - is that so? Because this rap is weak. So weak that neither B.E.T. or the Comedy Central touches her with a 10-foot chain of gold. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is poetry def next to this dr. Suesse in the hood. So do not be boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
