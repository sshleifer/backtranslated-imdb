I've seen this movie many years ago and I was amazed ... but I was only 12 years old. I recently watched her again, and I want it to be time. This movie is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (check out My Bodyguard (1980) if you wanted to see a good movie that he was in ... Meatballs (also plays Bill Murray) for some laughs) and Burgess Meredith, this role does did not do anything for his career. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is an ex-racing automobile driver who plans to drive his racing car (which he had in stock) across California. One problem: The government banned all private transport. I thought the concept was fine (not worse than what I heard), but really unsuccessful.
