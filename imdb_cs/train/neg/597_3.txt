This film is a perfect example of the recent balls of horror films that are simply not fully realized. There are two ways to do it in horror films: either what you actually do (or who is a killer like a Texas Chainsaw chain massacre) or give the characters a lot of stories and characterizations to explain everything Halloween could be an example of that ). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep is failing in this area. I do not see absolutely no reason to give Craig a small broken story without fully capturing the nature of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most famous part of the story. In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated, and none of the performances give him the necessary life to be so charming or interesting to overcome the lack of context and the blank film making the film. This movie will go down as another example of the movie (like most of them) that could be much better, though it would never be great. The only thing that was right in the movie was the setting: characters, story, direction, and overall writing would benefit from a serious face. <br /> <br /> Creep served purposeless mindless, silly horror films without intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it ...
