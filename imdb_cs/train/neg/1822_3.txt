Greetings again from the darkness. What ever happened to the great Barry Levinson? He diluted two of my favorites all in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had some great movies ("Rainman"), but he always provided something interesting ... until now. I believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is a definition of boredom. Never from a big fan of "Dumb and Dumber", I was just amazed at the horror of this movie. There are maybe 2 laughs in the whole thing - if you can pay attention so long. The best part of the movie is the gag, the title song Redbone sound-like. If the film was written as well as a song, it would be acceptable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to make a comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world has one weak point. Amy Poehler's SNL member is her usual over the top in her role as a trailer park that has become a princess. The misfortune of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work commutes together and promises some promise, but then their chemistry will disappear due to a bad script. This script is like most of Charles Black's thoughts - it's not a bad idea, but no hope for success.
