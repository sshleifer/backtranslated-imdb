I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and the sequel to The Lion King 2 and Hunchback Notre Dame 2). All of these films are made with the same idea; because the film has no plot, it tries to replace it by filling jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would give it 1/10. But now I think about it, most children do not care how good the original film is, they just care about the film's fun. I still think the movie was a bad one, but that does not mean it's terrible. Now I think he deserves 3/10.
