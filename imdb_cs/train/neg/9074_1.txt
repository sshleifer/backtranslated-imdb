Still another matter in the field of teenage silly comedy, located on a college campus in which there is a stupid quest for cooling, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular bets to force him to get a girl. Everything was done before, and everything was done in a much more satisfactory way. The gross humor that made teen films such as "American Pie" and "Dude Where My Car" so popular is completely excluded from this context and they appear randomly that the audience can only overlook and disagree. The film is badly written and the actors have never managed to get any of them even slightly. I will not even dignify this terrible picture, because it's a waste of time and yours. At best, Slackers can never have fun or laugh, and in the worst case it is unbearably bad and sometimes totally inconsistent. Jason Schwarzman, who was amazed at his Rushmore debut, is somewhat humiliated by appearing in this picture, and one asks how a career can end so quickly in the bathroom. Avoid, please, avoid. Save money.
