I agree with these reviews that I read here, and I have no words defining such a turkey as this, but despite everything, I can still find a reason why such movies exist. Do you describe the happy days where the video was a successful business and were filmed many movies with the only reason to fill in the shelves of the video rental? this movie comes from that time, and I can imagine it was the only reason it was made, and the same thing happened to many, many, many other marauders. Do you remember the imitation of "Rambo"? and so much slasher From Grade ?, I still feel nostalgia for this period. On this movie I can say that I did not waste time tracking it because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene in which the guy pushed the ax to the exploding head because, as you perfectly notice, of plastic. And probably the end, so it was so badly shot that I did not understand what happened. That's the same, in any case, I have not followed a nonexistent conspiracy. But boy, Video-age was a great age despite such movies.
