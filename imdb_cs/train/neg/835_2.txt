They watched both Lion King and Left King II, and they both enjoyed. I thought Lion King 1.5 could be worthy of attention. What a disappointment! Disney has to desperately try to earn revenue. Especially now that they have lost their contract with the pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, you just picked up some pieces of records that were left on the floor editor (or trash cans) and glued together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I and II, which had strong story lines. This movie barely has a story. While the characters and animations are always fun to see, just not enough material for the movie. Some of these bits could be a good second fill of the original menus. <br /> <br /> Disney - It is a pity on you to make this basket to make a quick buck! <br /> <br /> Next time, spend the time and effort and give our lasting work.
