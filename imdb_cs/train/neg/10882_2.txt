This movie is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. From the first scene I knew it would be a broken crash. It starts with a seemingly poor girl who has killed a bunch of nuns in the mission. As it turned out, people in it were obsessed with some random zombies. Well, a few years later some college students are doing some promising joke. Horror behavior goes from pledge to head. Things like a rider screamed at him to do things in a totally non-chalon way, with a commitment to reaction and over-doing the whole "longing to be a popular role." What he actually took a cake with is the last battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with a gun. For example, weapons that create noise without blinking the mouth, and vice versa. it is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they are moving at the stop of motion is a secret), cheese music, and about 40 weapons that come from nothing. Overall, this movie is crappy. Like many others, you can rent for 50 cents at the nearest eyebrow movie rental.
