Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great skater. If there was one person who deserved the gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. But how is it possible that Bill Corcoran made such a bad film about the unbelievable story of Dan Jansen, because the real Dan Jansen story is really incredible! Especially when you look at this film with the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, as Matt Keeslar and the other skaters, their technique, the speed of the oval, it's all bad! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
