I hate how this film has absolutely no creative input. I know they're going to realism, but to be honest, I just do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see my everyday life, I'm going to live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with low production values, damn that I'm crazy about low production values, but at least I work on some good ideas. Direction goes to catching a video camera and a little walk, but of course I do it because it makes things much more realistic. Hitchcock said the dramas were essentially life with faded bits. I can only conclude that it is not a drama, not a long shot. We see Rosetta walking somewhere, Rosetta is working in a bakery, Rosetta eating waffle, Rosetta carrying a lot of luggage, Rosetta going home, Rosetta going somewhere ... it's just not so fun. There is no deeper meaning either. I'm so boring that I started looking for some reflections about life in this movie, but it's just realism, the highest overrated quality in business. I think I like it, but come on, there's nothing.
