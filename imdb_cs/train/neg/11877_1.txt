I think it's almost all I need to say. However, I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I've never seen such a fitting, and I think in every sense of the word. Although the physical camera is working, boom MIC operations and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous, unfortunately they are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of the classic independent films that have been stored in their scenarios with great characterization and plot, they unfortunately have a modest scenario, terrible behavior, and the worst of all, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that for every independent film that gets distributed as a Haiku tunnel there are another 101 Indian movies that died of silent deaths. I do not know who the Kornbluth Brothers know at Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production got into distribution. I'm quite sad about why they chose it. The only part of this film that refutes an intrigue is its name. But the reason is that it happened. I hope that this review saves a few people who might be interested in this movie title to watch them. I've seen lots of movies in my time, and I'm very forgiving at the cinema, but it was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel" because I have marked an important point in my life experience with cinematography. It's a shame that it's such a low point.
