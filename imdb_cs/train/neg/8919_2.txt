I first saw it when it was selected as a design from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman, and I thought it might be interesting. Besides, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work and it started with the mood of his 30s. With both of them, I thought he would be interested. I was wrong. Just a few minutes, and I had a quick forward button. I ran it in about 15 minutes, and I thought it was. <br /> <br /> Then I read some more reviews and thought I did not give him a chance. I recorded it again and watched it. I do not return 75 minutes of my life. I can not believe there are no bad reviews. Personally, I think this is because it is difficult to get a minimum of 10 lines. How many ways exist when you say it's a waste of time? The film meets as if it were made by a few young tall children who are ready to outwit the world and think they can with their breasts, and funny jokes. The figures are flat. The parody of the "alphabet swing" is chrome, basically tapping on a melody, going through A-E, hitting the apparent stupidity of "F" and then not knowing where to go. Exit through the intestine to the expected landing does not work for the first time, let alone the following. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is what you would expect from someone who is trying "out of South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and is not funny. It might be fun if you are high. Otherwise it is not.
