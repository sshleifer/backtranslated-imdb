Mona Vagabond lives on the edge of French society in life without meaning, purpose or direction. I was looking at it for all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I did not want something. The character of Mony has little or no personality, as he passes through a life that is rude to people, he is tall and does not make any contribution to anyone. Not exciting or exciting. It's just useless. I have seen and know so many people like this: there is no secret meaning of what they are doing. They're just lazy bums. I would not want Monu anywhere near me, because she tends to steal everything that is not attached and leaves her buddies in a fit. Sure it's mysterious - because she's nothing. A lot of drug fans, winners and burns I've seen are mysterious; I would not want to see a movie about them. <br /> <br /> Maybe there's something I missed completely. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews come from people who assume that something the French director did is art.
