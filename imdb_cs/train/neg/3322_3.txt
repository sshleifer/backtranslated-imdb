Unfortunately for me was the first Busby Berkeley movie I've ever watched "42nd Street". Then I expected all his things to be so good. I found out that this is not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite classic actor James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the musical numbers at the end are just as beautiful as ever, but the story is like many of the others and it's pretty tiring. It always seems to include shouting, unhappy show of producers. In this movie, it's Cagney, who welcomes to scream things so often that he gives me headache after a while and his character wears thin ... fast! Even the songs here are anywhere near "42nd Street", songs that you could humor for years and years - decades, I should say. Tracks in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney films - and the Berkeley films - I do not like it, and I was very disappointed when watching.
