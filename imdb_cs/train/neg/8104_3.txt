yeah, but this is a great example of how a collection of "deepness" (political turbulence, love / lust) can be combined randomly with great critical recognition (see also "American beauty"). kaufman's film is produced along with free sex scenes scattered by often painful dialogue sequences (I counted three different "general European" accents influenced by actors in one scene), and state speeches could run amok and nevertheless failed to join together in the coherent meditation of the kundera offered. and in his long three hours he can almost hide over franz, missing the fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot, thus sacrificing the central mechanism of the novel to display the spectrum of emotions and power relations they get in love. but it does not even include the time of the screen token for the son Tomas, which is used in the novel to illustrate some of the political points that the kundera does in the novel. combined with a breakthrough soundtrack, these flaws make this movie three hours unbearably heavy in tone, yet light in content.
