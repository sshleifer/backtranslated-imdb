Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie, but the ball at night is much better, and this movie tells how Queen Mary Lou's death in 1957 kills her boyfriend and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside, and the movie stars are other actors and actors such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage, and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good gore scenes like when Mary Lou kills a girl who tries to hide in her cabinet breaking the cabinets together and one of the students is in the computer and Mary Lou electrocrashes him to death. Despite all this is ok / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
