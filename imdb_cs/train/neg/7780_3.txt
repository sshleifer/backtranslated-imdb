As soon as I could not delay or just turn off this pile, I decided to pull it out only if it happened that something might happen. This is the work of writer / producer / director / special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage when shooting monsters. That's what he wanted. It seems to be a lot of acting, a little swinging or just merry and merciless, and the scenes that seem to be repeated like the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck the woman is just going to be naked in it. .. though there are DISPEARANCE! <br /> <br /> It's just nonsense things, but I suppose it's not too damaging; it is not even very unpleasant, and once or twice we get a semi-interesting view of the Brazilian culture (a father who goes through the city with his flock or other pieces like "hey, that's not America!"). ). But any hope the director had in the making of Mitchuma or Carradin is best shed by the pedestrian and the worst unusually banal and stupid dialogue. This does not help that when we finally look at something at the monster and the "action" happens, it's also stupidly introduced and only with a cute appeal. Usually I would apologize for the filmmaker who had a lot of problems with the completion of a particular picture - in this case it took a better part of the mid-1970s - but with Monstroid or Monster or what is called ... nah. > <br /> If you happen to be a double function of this disc (poor print quality with poor quality of transmission) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip it. Unless you die Elvira and you will not be able to hear her promise; I personally would like to get Joel or Mike Nelson with Robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.
