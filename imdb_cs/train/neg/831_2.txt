Live! Yes, but I do not kick. True Story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station announced they were about to broadcast a new reality show. Contests rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who died of something terrible and she would give her kidneys a single happy man with progressive kidney failure. Actually. Earth and international media have been all along this story like turb fly, saying it's scary, immoral, what this world is about, and so on. I definitely had to agree. As the months passed, the tension was building up to the point that the government was mostly asked whether to let this show go or not, instead of running the country. The show climbed into the air until the last moment they pushed forward. And until the last moment the country was in the arms, the Prime Minister was showing speeches, each newspaper wrote about him, everyone in the country was holding his breath. And the network pushed. On the way to the new border on television. And they certainly did. They recorded an envelope. The show went out and we all watched the woman who was finally sick and chose the right candidate to get the kidney to live while she would die shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> And in the last moments of the show it turned out to be a partial scam. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show that with advertising and commercials, and all the discussions that have been building months to fantastic culmination, were promotional pieces focused on the problem of a great shortage of organ donors. The man who founded this particular network died of kidney disease. Now it's a television. Leave everyone far behind in awe. Do not do badly committed, misdirected film about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette on US television. <br /> <br /> if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I believed they would get it through the FCC. As if I believed she would get through the Supreme Court of the United States on free expression. As if I believed that ridiculous end when this woman pulled her out and had trouble with conscience because some guy shot in the air. It was all done before. Watch Run Al Man and Arnold instead. At least it had a semicircular end. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terribly bad film, along with a ridiculous end. So it's finally shot down, is that why we should feel better at the end of the theater because we had some kind of justice? Do not accept your word, but I will say: leave it alone and follow the test pattern, you get more quality.
