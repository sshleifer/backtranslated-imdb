This is probably one of the worst movies ever shot. Bad actions, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg-like cat appears. Malcom MacDowell had to need a house payment because otherwise he would have to sell to Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you could go from Clockwork Orange to that bullshit and be able to look myself in the mirror every morning. I could have done better effects in my bath. It has no connection. The proof must sleep or the drugs it's so bad, it works, it must smoke to make it bad ... A gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, thinks, a bad girl and another girl in the movie look so confusing that it's confusing As it's called 2013 Seadly Wake 2013. She has nothing to do with the movie
