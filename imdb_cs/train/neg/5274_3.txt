If you like movies about spooky cities, hotels, homes, states (let Eagles "Hotel California") etc., which include people who are just passing through, read out some Stephen King's novel instead. If you like the setting "Disappearance" start reading the King "Despair", but also look at "Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Necessary Things." The moon motif, the desert, the family that desperately drives to escape or avoid, is tired. Why did not they make the film "Despair"? Maybe they approached the king and put it on? It has to be. Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy to meet again and both have worn over the years, but TV actors and actors are still on DVD.
