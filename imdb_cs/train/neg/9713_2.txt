The first time I watched the cold thing was after what had been on Danish television for about a year. At that time it came to television almost drowned in 4 or 5 other US criminal performances broadcast at about the same time. I saw it and I was bored to death. The inappropriate actors with their own fair faces and morals were pain in their backs. The whole assumption that so much money was given to a team of investigators to deal with murders dating from 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems to be so unlikely. Time is also a factor because it only has 50 to 60 minutes to tell the story, which means they get a fraction just to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive. This, combined with the "personal" problems and the investigators' relationship, which must be the time to leave the exhibition, is totally insignificant. I give him a 2-star rating because music is the end, which is really the only reason why you are watching ... which of course you do not do because it is also a scary reason why you are looking at these bullshits.
