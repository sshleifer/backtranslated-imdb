I really feel that it happened. The director / writer / actor must really be really charismatic. I can not think of any other way that the scenario scenario is going through. I want you to think, it's ... watching movies I regretted for the actors. I thought you were in a comedy club where you dying on your feet and sitting there and not enjoying it just because it's really bad for him because he's trying. I really like to know what the budget is, I guess it must be low because the quality of the movie is really bad. I want to write that "jokes did not call me". but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you should be the man who wrote them. or retard. So imagine that in the form of scripts ... and that guy got that green lighted. That's impressive, is not it?
