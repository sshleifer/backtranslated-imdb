The unbearably slow pace of this film was probably the director's explicit intention to explain what life is like growing up as a teenage village in China. However, I found the combination of a glacially slow "conspiracy" and a general film style so impersonal that I totally alienated, especially for the western audience. Sometimes I had problems telling some characters apart because they were shot at such a distance. Two hours and I took care of myself. As someone who is not only interested in music, but also very involved in China 's history and culture (and by the way, it is not a foreigner to Chinese cinematography), I could not associate myself with a single character and found nothing. It wakes up the question: If I did not like who would like it on the ground? Give me Zhang Yima, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of almost any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This ugly effort simply will not be at all. I am sorry to see Chinese cinematography that has been judged against this benchmark.
