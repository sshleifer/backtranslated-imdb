Low budget effort from Texas, which is at least filmed well, but that's a bit of consolation. Badly acting or, I will say, a bad oversupply, a nice story bucket that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It seems that a lot of young people are building a scary house for Halloween, which is happening every year, but this year things are different. It has a long prolonged lesbian theme that is not only unpleasant, but it definitely fills vacant places, of which there is a lot. Putrid, childish, surely avoid, at any cost.
