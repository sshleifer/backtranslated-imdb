Mae Clarke will always be remembered as a girl whose face James Cagney showed grapefruit in the same year of THE PUBLIC ENEMY. It will not be remembered for this strange little story about a girl and a hood that finds her past will always be with her. In some ways, it looks a bit ancient for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the beautiful, inert LIGHTS OF NEW YORK, 1928. But do not be fooled. Though Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in big scenes, there is plenty of movement, which shows the scattering of viewers in setting-up them. But in competition with the rapidly developing things that everyone seems to do at Warner's, this attempt to bring a female look into the genre as a tearjerker does not work, or Mae Clarke's actress carries this effort.
