This movie is similar to "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The conspiracy of the wife of the spirit and the media is firmly connected with the writing of Coward. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I realize that the public may not be aware that it is a knockout, but it is. These movies are so expensive. I do this when the script is original. I'll even pick up when it's an innovative way of creating a work that was previously released. Some samples were mentioned (for example, Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize movies are still a fairly affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not asking for public perception to be self-evident. In this situation, the public is impoverished. <br /> <br /> I look forward to better cinema entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I'd rather see the game.
