Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that director Busby Berkeley shot for Warner Bros. His directorial style has changed or evolved to such an extent that this film does not include his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. Over the last few years of the 1930s, the biggest popular hits of the largest swing band have been recorded. The Swing Era, also called the Big Band Era, was dated differently from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to accurately determine the moment the swing started, Benny Goodman is engaging in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the first signs that the swing enters the consciousness of the American youth. When Goodman presented his swing repertoire rather than the social dance music his group played, the audience was amazed at the audience. That was the beginning, but because radio, live concerts and oral talks were the primary methods for spreading phenomena, it took some time before the swing made enough turns to produce the big hits that pop up in the pop charts. In Hollywood, Benny Goodman and his orchestra, and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in film, seem to suggest that the film industry was ready to use chapters in the shift of music (the film was in production for only a year and a half after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom engagement). There are some interesting musical moments at the Hollywood Hotel, but besides Benna Goodman and his orchestra "Sing, Sing, Sing" there is not much pleasure. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening of "Hooray for Hollywood" and "Let It Be a Lesson to You" in the restaurant. The movie is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his play Orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
