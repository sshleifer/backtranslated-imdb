I know there are other things in this episode in addition to what I'm going to discuss, and in fact I think she has some virtues; For example, the fact that, after we got very negative opinions about seeing Sun appear in the "House of the Rising Sun," we see Jin coming into the matter and gaining a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But in this story there is an element that has made me so deeply disturbed that it has greatly suppressed my delight in the whole episode. Previously on the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was suggested that Sun's father was someone who became rich through shady and unlawful methods. I thought maybe he was the boss of the crowd, even; crowds are working in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable option. In this episode, however, we learn that Sun's father is in fact the head of the Korean automobile society and that what Jin does is physically attack a government official (who was actually murdered) on his behalf. I could be particularly sensitive to it, because I accidentally work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY insulting and racist even suggesting it is happening in Korea; that huge corporations such as Hyundai or Kia (which must be a model for this fictitious automotive company because they are the only ones that actually exist) work with these mafia methods instead of any normal car company in the West. it's absolutely unbelievable for me that the writers would be sorry to write such a story, and that there was no uproar in Korea. He feels like a strange "Buy American!" propaganda, depicting foreign automobile companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third world clothes.
