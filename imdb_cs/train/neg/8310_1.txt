Another large-scale plot plot that attempts to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever made time in the US military can see how fake the film is. Uniforms, equipment, kits and manners are bad. (And of course, all officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Crazy propaganda without attempting objectivity. Most of the presented theories have been refuted in recent years. Uses of Every Clich√©, "and the Urban Legend of the Persian Gulf - all presented as a gospel. (The truth is, nobody knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as a horse.) PS This is not new. and I know veterans of World War II, Korean, and Viet Nam with some very serious illnesses. (And the government has a duty to take care of everyone.) Sticky films like this will not solve the problem!
