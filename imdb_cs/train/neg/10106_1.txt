Yeah, I'm sure it can really be a nation. . . if four of them stood in the four corners of the world and the other two cloned several billions of billions. Man, I'm really glad I saw this movie at FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romer films, and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he would probably avoid if he laughed too much. I mean, what were the raccoon daughters' daughters and they were going like Charlie's devils? This really helped the music composer pick a dirty fashion show when the zombies went to their killer, especially the part he walks into the warehouse representing the furniture / police station / apartment / flat / with a gonge in the background and a living woman argued about a closed furniture store. I could not even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent suggested that some nations did not even help. Oh, what can I expect from a movie where they throw a random battle scene without a good reason in a warehouse where they probably carry boxes of air all over the world. So for all those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000, or if you like making good C (C for Craptastic), then that's the movie for you. . . or not.
