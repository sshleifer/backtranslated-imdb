It's a really bad and easy worst episode I've ever seen .... They tried to fix it by giving it a "routine that we're doing." That would be ridiculous if it did not mean that the Simpsons had already done so. And that would not be a good idea if they came up with the idea. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks have taken place as part of the fantasy of the usual character (mainly J.D). The flashes were not about the actual events that occurred, just compiling say, J.D falling or I do not know ... Elliott is falling. If I wanted to watch the Scrubs compilation, I'll go to you and I'm not losing half an hour of life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs eventually fell into a trap that most sit-coms have to do, and it disappoints me that I managed to release the 5th quarter of a quarter without such an episode. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that scrubs might not be such a sit-com. And just like the thought of why he crapted Dr.Cox?
