What do you have when you have bad acting, bad direction, scenarios that are unbearably long, terrible lighting, painful adjustments and terrible effects? You'll Get Jessica: The Story of the Ghost It seems that his shot at betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case, it is not. There are several CU, where the human face is completely shadowy. One scene is primarily a scene for psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily be solved in half ... but I think they would not have a long feature film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is a lead man, so he should have some "heroes" for his character, but not. He screamed and the whole movie was horrified. I could go on, but I do not wanna waste time. Though the lighting was terrible, I must say they had a beautiful camera motion. Pity it was not bad. DVD packaging is nice and it's over. Just terrible.
