This movie was terrible. I give him a high score of 2, as I have seen worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> From the clich√© begins to have the end of the movie at the beginning and return to the start at the end of the film used everything in a box of tricks used in the film just because of the boy with too many toys. It was an endless, boring recurring narrative, slow motion, freeze frame, sample and merged images, etc. - none of them made the boring movie any better. It's called "16 years of alcohol," but there was little drinking or drunkenness and no downloading with a movie jumping all over the place without a coherent sense. The story was badly written and extremely demanding, and the direction was just as poor, and it is a shame that people put more money on Mr. Jobson's earlier films, who previously knew they were in a group of garbage and that television had as much meaning as this film. <br /> <br /> I've found it a big game to see it all the way, but in the hope it's getting better, I've gone to bitterness but it was really a waste of time and I'd be better off do not bother.
