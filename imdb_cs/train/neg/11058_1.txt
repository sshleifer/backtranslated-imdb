A disappointed and undoubtedly boring film about the real crime of badly cast actor Jeremy Renner, who faintly mumbles over the lead role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most famous degenerates / serial killers of the last century. Released directly on the video back in early 2003, "Dahmer" is obviously talky, boring, badly committed and practically blood-free snoring of a real crime drama that never really interferes with the monstrous and demented psychology of the late mass murderer as if it had a great potential! What, however, tries to do for unknown reasons, raises compassion for the audience with his man by portraying him for what is ultimately a lonely, undisciplined and strongly socially awkward homosexual loser who simply seeks "for love in all the wrong places, for the Dahmer in 2003 is such that all fans of true crime can skip because I'm not talking when I say it's one of the worst biopic killer series! It's even more fun than other poor and exhausting garbage like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-null stars)
