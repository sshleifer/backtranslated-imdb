Wow. That's about as much as I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? What self-respecting actor would agree to "act" in these matters? Oh my god! I do not know how I did it through this movie, but I suppose I had about 8 cups of coffee that day was a key element that kept me awake. Good God! It was one of the most exhausted and predictable cinematography I've ever witnessed ... and I never planned to "hear" it again. <br /> <br /> The movie when I bought a DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. He's fine. I look at it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to watch her without screaming every five minutes and wondering if this shit of the blind had ended, I really did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what's up with the thing, where does he imagine what's going to happen, then come back to real life? It was pretty bulletproof when my father did it in parenthood ten years ago. "Jokes" - and believe me, it's enough that I call myself - they're stupid, the characters are nasty and forgotten, the plot is completely predictable ... overall it makes a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORICAL RECORDS! I had to imagine that something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. It was most likely direct to DVD. For anyone who thinks it will follow, I have one. DO NOT USE! For LOVE God ... NESM√çTE !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection and I can not get rid of it ... Nobody and I think NOBODY wants to buy it from me! And I'm talking about secondary and third-hand shops that buy mud from bot and store it in the shop window. This should tell you how CRAP is.
