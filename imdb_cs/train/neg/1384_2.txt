Jet Li, is one of the best combat fighters in the world. He has been over 20 years old and put others into the genre of shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown in the United States. The black mask should be a breakthrough film for him, but it is terribly bad. First he dubbed it. While it may have the value of a camp (the dabing is not even close and flat in tone), it seems to be inappropriate for a regular movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this film, Daniel Lee, is doing a terrible job. Such scenes stretch so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Otherwise, the camera shakes and rotates. Fans see Jet Li movies for fantastic martial arts. However, the director adjusts the scenes so fast that you do not even know who is who half the time! Otherwise, the scene lets hang (ie, Li begins to cut a hole in the floor of the jeep, while the badguys gun weapons, two seconds later, as Li and love is already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely they go beyond the meaning of being totally ridiculous (CD-ROM killers? Just give him the stars !!!!). Li, needs a director who is less susceptible to cutting machine guns and rather to create a movie mission-a-scene. Added rap / techno music is that it's ok to disturbing. The conspiracy has the potential, but they are all scorned by cartoon characters that are postponing the credibility that this film strives for. And do we really believe that a loving interest does not know Simon because he has a half mask? Would not they want a hair, a jaw or a voice? If you want to see the Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This incoherent mess is a complete waste of time ... 2/10
