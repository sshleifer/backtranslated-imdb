I usually like zombie movies, but this was just bad. Good parts: A toy-free swimsuit with a thong bottom, Sonya Salomaa is free of swallowing and Ona Grauer's breasts are joking on the dirty top when she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many movies, too much Matrix slow motion, lack of blood and guts, bad behavior and no story. The only other person in the theater was clever and left immediately after the peak swimming scene. Total loss of $ 6 and time. I give it 2 out of 10.
