I am definitely in a minority opinion on this subject. "The Hurt Locker" won the "Best Picture" award from critical groups than any other film this year. However, I not only did not like it, it was difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is minimal conspiracy and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm other bombs. That's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera never stops and is constantly shaking. This was the latest fashion in making movies and it should look more realistic because it has a cheap, documentary look at it. The camera shuddered so much that it made me uneasy when I was looking at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about war films and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not have to worry about it because the critics love it.
