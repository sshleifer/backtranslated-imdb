the guy he wrote drove and stared at this shocking piece of waste, he really should consider a guardian's change. Yes, Rob Stefjuek, I think of you! Seriously, who financed it? there are a lot of talented writers who can spend money better. I think the idea is great, but acting, script and directing are just terrible! Jokes are not so funny, I understand they should be with mickey. But you do it in style, this movie screams on Saturday night live skits. Why, I say again, why studios give money to hackers like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER ALLOW THE COMPETITION THE OPPORTUNITY OF PREPARING DIRECT AND STAR IN THEIR OWN FILM. DUH!
