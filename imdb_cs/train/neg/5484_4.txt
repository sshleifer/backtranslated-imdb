This film is about a family trying to cope with the deaths of a mother and a woman by moving to Italian Genova. The story of "Genova" sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes depicting the everyday life of a family, such as swimming, arranging piano lessons, or cooking eggs. Most such scenes are superfluous and tiring and do not entirely interest the viewers emotionally. The end is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say I'm disappointed and bored "Genova" The only thing that's good for the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. "Genova" can serve as an expanded ad for tourism for the city, but not as a movie you enjoy.
