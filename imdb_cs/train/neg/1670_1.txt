The premise of the film is scary: a woman pregnant when a stranger kisses her in the bar. But once the movie begins, the terrible opening scene will prove to be Sci-Fi C-type film. It's a big Star Trek and some X-Files, but more than anything else it's boring. When the movie sets off, everything is predictable and clich√©. It looked more like a 2 parter in the wrong TV series Sci-Fi. No tension and no excitement, but not for lack of attempts. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts among the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
