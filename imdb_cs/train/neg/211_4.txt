The merry apparition of "drama" about a group of high school kids (I think) who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dance, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at Roxy - or something. To be totally honest, I was bored that I forgot! Even people who love music agree that this film is a terrible act and - as a drama - failed unsuccessfully. I think we should find the kids sympathetic and dear. I found them boring and boring. The one I really hated was Ramon. It does graffiti on the underground trains and it is considered great. Excuse me? Degrades public property from which it can not. Also, these "great" kids are going to go to the city's electricity to hold a big dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we should find a lot of tempting and entertaining codes. I could forgive everything if the music was good, but I can not be a hip hop. The song was - at best - average and it was not possible! They always play! I achieved that I quickly sent out a number of endless musical numbers. (Cut the music and win a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are several inventive numbers - a dance fight, a really humorous Santa number and Roxy Climate Show. If you like hip hop, here's your movie. But you are looking for a good mixed drama - forget it. Also, how did the PG get it? This is an incredible amount of oath.
