What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days before I watched Lillies and it was one of the best gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to look at the average Gay story. The story was stupid and the acting was fine. It was not bad enough to turn off, but it had bad times and some terrible stereotypes. It was not very good. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie? No, you're wasting time and money. I do not understand why such films are produced and who finances them. Spend Time Trace Noem's Arch to Logo instead. I think this is where this movie tried to go, but never got there.
