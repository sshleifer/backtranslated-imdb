As for me, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version it ever was. There is no tenderness, love, or spirituality about this version, it is all scary, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me that the Nazis fell in love; Who is interested? This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this, we asked John Gilbert and his rough-hearted prince, who was joking about this stupid American actress played by Mae Murray, who had a modern hairstyle and a perfect feminist haircut that was throwing me out again and again. I like my romance light and beautiful, with slow building; it's not harsh and sadistic like this one. And go, the bees hit your lips, get rid of them, lass! Take a look at the live show of the show if you wanted to get a real idea of ​​the original operetta from Franz Lehar. Otherwise, wait until the TCM shows the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It's much better.
