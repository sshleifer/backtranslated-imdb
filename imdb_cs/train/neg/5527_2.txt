The zombie rebellion is BAD. Nothing fun in the movie. It's boring, lifeless, badly committed and badly written. I often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, but this film makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. 65 minutes of running seemed 165 minutes. Story: The expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the secrets of mind control through "zombification." One man finds a secret and uses it to take the woman he loves. As soon as it happens, the zombie releases under its control the terrible consequences. And it is done. That's the whole story. For most of the movie, I tried to find out where I saw male leadership. He looked so good. I had plenty of time to think. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies revolted," it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him recently as a general in white Christmas. So I enjoyed "the whole movie". <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I did not buy a DVD for this movie. King Zombie is on the other hand and it's the masterpiece of the film compared to this movie. For what's worth, I'll give it 2/10. (I do not want to go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen even worse.)
