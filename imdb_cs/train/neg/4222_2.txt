For those of us who have lived during the weeks of filming in the city and around the Valley - let's not forget the tiring days of road closures and "filming". As a reminder for those who live here - locations include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was firehouse BC; the chased scenes included Moon Drive outside Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above all - even then. As for the movie - a joke of a screenplay and even more laughter about acting and plotting - but who cares at this level. A nice time capsule for those who like the coast and the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar, the original movie name was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erby's parking lot was square, courtyard shots were off Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the idea and see a few actors in the early days.
