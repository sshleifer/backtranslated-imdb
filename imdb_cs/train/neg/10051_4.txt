I gave 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes that have been mentioned many times. From domestic violence, sexuality and many taboos. Besides the gore, I would not really call this horror as much as I could scientific fiction. It's annoying, depressing and hopeless. While I did not mind less than a happy ending, I'm really tired of the clich√© "people sucking", which is for every film in the center. I know that today you can not get a liberal arts diploma without worshiping a change of your own hatred as a member of the human race, but as a writer / director, we pretend to be different from everyone else in the pack and notice that ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil! Right now, if you read it and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim when your arms get tired. This way you will not try to drive another movie or write another book that tells me that I deserve to die for being alive. It's stupid, not thoughtful and boring.
