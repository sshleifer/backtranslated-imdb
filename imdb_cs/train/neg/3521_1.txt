I still shudder over the idea that the movie has reappeared. I saw action movies, I even liked them, but this is over. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) who plays the lead role, but the movie plot is so foolish from the start (why not take away money while the plane is on the ground, hell is much easier) , that requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /> <br /> Besides, the plot has no real twists, a three-year-old guy could guess what's next. This is a clich√© set (action genre), while Sly is even worse than his other movies (it was better in Rambo III if you watched this movie as a comedy rather than an action movie). Now an actor who can not act A) surprised B) sad C) something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would also like to emphasize that this film has two factors that some people may like. Explosions are excellent, but then ... you see better on July 4th. THE COUNTRIES are spectacular, but then ... there are documents about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better than to waste your time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Now look at some other movie, there are hundreds, even thousands of quality action movies.
