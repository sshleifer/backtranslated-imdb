Man! What a piece of crazy movie! But it's the guilt of childhood, even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border), we had this thing called Channel G on our cable system. And basically they showed the same movie over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. I fell in lust and love with young Brooke Shields and I loved her adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script has almost no sense, direction is bad, little interesting is that Henry Fonda is appearing, lots of dialogues that are so bad that it's a good and nice song Carole King played over the end credits. You may have to be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in Grand Canyon!
