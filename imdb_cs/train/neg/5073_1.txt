The demonstrations for Tree of Palme will try to convey it as an allegory for a real-life fairy tale, and animations will start to animate immediately. I should have known what it meant. The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole film problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, another violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on the girl he once cared for. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is badly defined. You do not bother with the characters even though Shatta has gotten a couple of girls' fans. It seems that the writer was more interested in filling up all the drama and complexity he could have in this film than in the actual exploration of the motives and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> New, unnecessary stories were introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The writer really needed to simplify his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour film. However, I can not wonder if a conspiracy with so many dimensions and characters could be better suited for a TV series or graphic novel. In the last five minutes of the movie, I just could not suffer from the inadequate quality and began to laugh as the characters, the relationships and the whole conspiracy were built. I touched my companion and started to crack as well as the young man who was behind us. We tried to control ourselves so much, but we just could not take the terrible quality of this movie. On the bright side the animation is incredible and viewers find themselves admired by the lush background and charming character designs. Animation almost drives you; if you do not care about the characters, it will tell you how to feel.
