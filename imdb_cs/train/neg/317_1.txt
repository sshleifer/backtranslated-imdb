It must be the worst movie I've ever wanted to watch. In the first 15 minutes there was nothing I was interested in about this film. I was on vacation at that time and had enough time to devote myself to the film just for fun. The apartment we stayed with had this film in stock - had to get it out of a $ 1 store or something. If you like Adam Sandler, it's nothing but a different movie he did. It started with a bad assumption, then worsened. There is nothing strange about it. I've seen a lot of movies, including some that I did not care about. But if you decide to waste time on this movie, do not say I warned you.
