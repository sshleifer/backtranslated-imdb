Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most troubling thing in this attempt to reconstruct Scooby-Doo and society. Shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound like anything like the earlier incarnations of Scooby's shows. They also changed their clothes and the classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on with the angle of the villain, but it certainly does not follow the formula used in any previous Scooby performance. <br /> <br /> And the style of animation is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo animation. But the strange animation used for other exhibitions has grown to me; it could also be. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look - once - if you do not have the right Shaggy voice. It is true that it is enough for a man to enjoy the show. Besides, I'm trying to be an inflexible, hostile fan. It will arise or die, as they say. Let's see what it looks like after two more episodes - by that time I have made a much firmer view.
