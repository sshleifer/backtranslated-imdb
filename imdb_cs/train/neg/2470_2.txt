Over the years, I have seen many horrific performances, such as Nightstalker, dealing with the legend of Wendigo, so I was looking forward to the angry spirit that caused chaos to add taste to the Halloween season. You were wrong. The entire movie creates this feeling of events that will become terrifying and scary, but then brings a very simplistic story of revenge and murder over the loss of some property. Ve-ery terrifying - no! This movie has a lot to do with Cold Creek Manor, another quite lost. It's getting harder and harder to believe what Hollywood is filming for scary movies because they are rarely going through an increasingly original and scary movie. What idiots pay for such a fake movie to be made? Go back to the cartoonists and do something useful with the millions of dollars you have to throw.
