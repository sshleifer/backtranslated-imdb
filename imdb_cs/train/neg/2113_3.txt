The brides are dying on the altar and their corpses have disappeared. No one knows why or who, but investigating reporter (Luana Walters) notes that every bride wears a strange orchid and walks after an interview with the creator of Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with special habits, including sleeping in coffins and injections of his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of a young bride to her young. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes has an interesting assumption and a short enough run that should not be boring. Unfortunately, as it begins quite well, it begins to pull off half the point and gets quite dull with its clich√© and predictable plot. There are a few good things about it-Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and brilliantly acting; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, stunning, daring and very scary countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter. <br /> <br /> It keeps a bit of Gothic atmosphere and sets are decent. But overall, it has not kept my interest in the whole picture and I have to evaluate it badly.
