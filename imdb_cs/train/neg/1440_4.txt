Swayze is not too convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Grange; who grew up as my ultimate hero in films such as the Scaramouche of 1952, 1952 ZdenÄ›k Zenda and 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze completely failed. Even the portrait of Sean Connery's older Alan Quatermain in the League of Exceptional Gentlemen was very good in a different big flop. Also, Alison Doody misses the mercy of Deborah Kerr as the front lady and last but not least, the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopy is very difficult for someone to fill their shoes !!! For someone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain in 1985, I recommend him if you can not get your hand on the Granger version.
