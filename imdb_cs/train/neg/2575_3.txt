It does not really match Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is not as funny, crazy or as hyperactive. Scenery and music are uninitiated, and the plot is simply not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this "un" is nudity (Fujiko only) in the uninterrupted version. This helped to taste some of the boring scenes. CoC had an impressive villain and prepared a movie for some imaginative sets. Location in TSoTG is not too lively or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even provide decent entertainment this time. It is as if they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full swing with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent number of accessories, including several trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection or time code on the disc when it is inserted. Although you can skip to the next scene number using the remote control.
