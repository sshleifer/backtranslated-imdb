Director Sidney J. Furie created a postmodern absurd masterpiece in Hollow Point that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. Sidney J. Furie dares to ask what happens to the tired traditional paradigms of "conspiracy" and "characterization" when you remove crutches of "motivation" and "reason." <br /> <br /> The result leads me to the fact that my opinion could not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense, law enforcement officers are absolutely insurmountable, and organized criminals are full of madness.
