Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Spyilerific comments. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly retired officer (clich√©!) who helps everyone - he smiles as a postoperative lobotomic patient through the outside and mourns over his dead son. His adopted son returns from the Special Ops army, and because he "saw things" - he drew his teeth when someone mentions the past. It is time to calm down the street from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed a boy) and his adopted son. Oh, love interest is a pretty young lady who decides no reason to want to jump the bones of a former army boy. This happens about 2 minutes from one scene. The action could save this movie, but it's even worse than action and acting. Everything was done before, everything was much better (Ong-Bak is an excellent example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld, twice. Erm, the movie is named Honor (badly written for Americans) and the brand has "from the creators of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - check out director David Worths and you will soon realize why these two films are reported even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - says it all really. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 10 pounds if you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - I'm sorry for the unknown character names, but something tells you.
