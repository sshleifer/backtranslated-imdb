Last year I saw this movie in the Media class and I must say I really hated it. I was 10 (and at the age of 15) so it may have something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also George Orwell. Besides the fact that the book is based on the revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book and I also hate it. But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen and I think George Orwell is one of the most worried people ever living on this planet. I apologize to all who loved his work, but unfortunately I did not. The themes in the movie were well-drawn, but the way the movie was set and the events that took place in it were not according to my standards. That's just my opinion and I'm sure many other people are enjoying this movie thoroughly.
