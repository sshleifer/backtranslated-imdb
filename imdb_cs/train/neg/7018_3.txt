Totally forgotten. Especially due to weak influence. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. My surprise has been since the late 1990s. I thought he was a newcomer because his acting was so loud. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Even though I saw her in other movies well, Clare gave a strange personality to Cooper. Liv is not such an actress who gives the character a fiery, emotional personality that Diane Keaton would have done, but it was quite strange to see her as she called her line in a whisper. The actresses seemed just not very good chemistry, and I think Diane Keaton felt it too. She's a fantastic actress, but it seemed to me a little over the top in this movie. It seemed like she wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I would not blame her.
