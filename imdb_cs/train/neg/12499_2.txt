I went to the film as a preview of Sneak in Austria. So she had no idea what I would see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I think it could reduce to 1/2 without causing the story. It's the type of movie you can see in the boring night you want to bore more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is all right. The film talks about US coastguards, how they are trained, about their lifestyle, and about the problems they face. Because there are no big effects in the movie. So if you want to watch it, you will not have to waste money and time to go to the cinema. It would be much more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVD.
