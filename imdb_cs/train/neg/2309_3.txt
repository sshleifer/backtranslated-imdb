I have a high degree of tolerance for the weird, but honestly, some movies are on the way, overlapping strange - so far they cause your brain to hurt. That's such a movie. I try to understand or even explain that it is impossible and I think the film is best understood when using drugs - it's incomprehensible. The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation with a cat. However, from blue, twists and occasional distractions happen - and I wonder if I'll lose something in translation. But even if that were the case, why did we have to deal with the paintings of a magic trick involving the laughter of a lady with a clever, defecting, puffing, lighting the animals in the fire, etc. It all looked really random and quite terrible. Special, and I do not know why, some see it as a brilliant work. I just do not get it.
