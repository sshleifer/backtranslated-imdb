I work at Blockbuster and every week we have movies that come with just a few copies, movies that show the Sci-Fi channel. The sort of movie nobody ever wants, and only the idiot rents them when they bring them back. I ask them: "Was it good?" They say that "after 15 minutes we did not stop him!" Movies with horrific computer-generated, super-saved monsters and the like, very uncomfortable. It's the same type of movie that's Grendel, and the absolute waste of time if you want to rationally (and only reasonably) a good Beowulf based movie then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who also plays in an impatiently anticipated 300 as King Leonidas Sparta . Plus, later this year we have another Beowulf movie, with stars cast by Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleason, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. But do not let your hopes grow as we do with Eragon, or we're all in for another big disappointment. And with regard to renting, here is my rule: If there is only one or two copies, do not borrow it because it's damn. (This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is alien or documentary.)
