Unimpressed, short for a lot of half naked men who grin and put themselves in. And it is done. We can see it for about 5 minutes. He is shot in black and white with the tones of half-naked men who stretch around and celebrate in terrible music. It finds it interesting, but there is no conspiracy and indeed - the violence that is actually in this is worrying. Also homo erotism in this is to play, but mixing with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material would like it, but it was incomprehensible, boring, silly and (occasionally) worrying. Really - what is in all things? I saw it as part of the gay festival, and the audience sat in amazed silence. I wish I could go below 1.
