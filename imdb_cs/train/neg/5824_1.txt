I thought it would be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, demanding, and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there's one song at the end that's just some guy yelling "Yaowwww!" while someone accidentally clicks on a wooden object. That being said, there are some nice songs, but it is not worth watching the movie hte. Go to the itunes (have the album), show them and pick the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, that's a little exaggerated. But you'll see what I mean when you see it. It was said: DO NOT KNOW!
