It really shows that the hype is not everything. It shows what the dirty actor abhishek is, and he gets only films for his father and his wife. As always, Amitabh is firm. Ajay Devgan, as always, is unnecessary and useless, and the new guy is a joke. The front lady is such an actor's loss. Such a pathetic film from such a reverend director and such a big industry. With films as such, I've reduced the number of Bollywood movies I'm watching. RGV has been doing very hrappy movies for a while. It's time to get out of different actors. Hrithek someone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajola back. Every other front lady is half-naked to be. Pffffft.
