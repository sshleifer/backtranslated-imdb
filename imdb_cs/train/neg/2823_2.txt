Well, TiVo recorded it for Angelina Jolie. She had 2.5 stars. It looked promising. She descended quickly. <br /> <br /> There are many exaggerations, even from Angelina. He is about 20 years old and plays for 16 years. There are three characters to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian-American. The original Italian accents were good, I thought. The young boy is cute, says my wife. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even men. I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was occupied as a rand doctor, it was a bad sign. Two couples who chase their children around are like four Italian Stoogs. My wife would not let go. Hopefully she will not be using makeup, clothing or decorating. It was a bad and twisted combination of hideous and cruel. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Cutting my left ventricle was not enough to avert the pain of watching this movie. If this movie appears on your TV, do yourself a favor and instead mount your head across the TV screen. You will be glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen is worse than this was "Hamburger: Film". Or maybe "A Deadly Friend".
