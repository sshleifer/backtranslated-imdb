The long list of "big" names in this movie (including the ubiquitous John Mills) has not slipped me to the point that I could not judge the film for its true merits. It's full of stereotypes, cartoons, and standard scenes, from the humble hero of the air ese to the noisy flyer. The musical composition was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie ended: loud, upward crescendo, big bloom and finish silence, but then the movie went on! I did not find any real story, unfortunate writing, but elegantly molded uniforms and pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose work) with an exciting little ditty. I can not say that this picture contains some ingredients that make the film great. I found out he was Maudlin, mawkish and minor.
