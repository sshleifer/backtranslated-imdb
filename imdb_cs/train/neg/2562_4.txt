Let me start by saying that this movie has at the beginning a fun point in exchange for the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get a part? George: I think he's lucky. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is the only fun part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's still fun ... But then I have fun again ... <br /> <br /> I do not think this is the worst movie I've ever seen (the title goes to a terribly dysfunctional Disaster Movie ...), this movie falls # 7 on my list 15 ... <br /> <br /> If your little kid who enjoys easily enjoys this movie. If you are a filmmaker who wants a good, fun movie, you end up shooting in half ..
