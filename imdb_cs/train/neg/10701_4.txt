Merry crazy pieces at the London stadium are chasing a treasure, with one young woman who inadvertently prepared her married father with a strong and independent lady who never became in love. An interesting early car for Katharina Hepburn, who played as Aviatrix, resembling Amelia Earhart, who was too busy to take over to a man. Director (Dorothy Arzner) and screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted the book by Gilbert Franka) was clearly assigned to this project to gain a female look, but why are all old clich√©s undamaged like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of exciting, crying woman who fits into bed when something goes wrong and Hepburn's last scene is another bummer. A quaint artifact, but not a classic for Kate's observer. ** z ****
