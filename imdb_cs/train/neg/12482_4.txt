Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and stars Rick Hill, who is some body builder and famous when I understand correctly? The story follows when Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from an evil master and has to travel to a cave cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his trip and setting is very close to Tolkien and of course the Conan barbarian. This is a break away from Conan's huge success, and although it's a very stupid film, it has many wonderful experiences and is recommended for garbage fans and tolerant movie fans! <br /> <br /> There is not much cinematic merit in this movie. A few scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker focuses on are naked women and the huge Hill muscles. Women are mostly helpless victims and also very stupid, so it's a very macho movie, so you do not have to please many feminists! Battle scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and the monsters are not something special. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateur and badly done, but what did you expect from a low budget of such an effort? It tries to be as large as Conan, but it fails to a large extent. As I said, it can delight cinema fans in Turkey, but no one else. It belongs to the category, it is so bad! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad as it could be, and like a turkey movie I appreciate it almost like other turkeys, of course fun! If the bad movies are your cup of tea, try and have fun, but if you do not understand "nice bad movies," then stay on. And if someone can not endure a lot of nudity, then stay away as well. There is more nudity than violence, and given these scenes, the movie has a rating of R. Otherwise it could be a safe family film PG! <br /> <br /> 4/10
