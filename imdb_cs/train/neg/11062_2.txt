How to get an ace! You have just done a cool, horribly interesting story about a necrophilic cannibal in a soft, soft drama. Apparently the Dahmer film would be one of two kinds: Horror or Documentary Law? It was not one. It was not close to any detailed facts (in fact, it did not have any substance at all). It was not really morbid or frightening, not even trying to be very worrying (as if you had to try it!) What the hell the writer / director thinks? Here is one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers at all, and we shot badly, mistakenly acted on gay bar roofie rape and long droning memories at the very time in your old parent's house. I think Jacobson actually attempted to introduce (or invent) the "soft side" of J. Dahmer.
