This movie was bad. I love war films and usually I can leave most of the movies and find something I liked but this was not one of them. This film lacked the essence and intensity. OK, I got it, the Finns have done one hell and that's great, but the story is wrong. You have no real connection with any character and there is no real story. You're just moving from one random scene to another, there's nothing to create a story you're trying to say. If you want a war movie that keeps you riveted and so surprisingly without fighting scenes, I recommend "Downfall" (German film of World War II). Or if you prefer a great story and a lot of action, I recommend the "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two movies will not disappoint you as a winter war.
