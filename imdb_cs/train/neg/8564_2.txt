The film itself is so pathetic. He portrayed deaf people as cynical to hear people. It is true that some deaf people are cautious when they hear people, but they do not have to be angry, as was the story of Marlee Matlin. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way Matlin did. Overall, the film is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring I want to believe it's a cure for insomnia. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply jump to the children of a smaller God and watch. It will sleep. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that he is a deaf man who speaks.
