Unfortunately, I can not remember the book, but I recall that I was enchanted by Edgar Wallace's stories. This film is a typical German low quality production. I do not mind - though the story is good, it's simply wrong. In the center of poverty there are characters that are too simplified and exaggerated - they do not have any nuances in their performance. Even the well-known and beloved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy can not rescue this bad show. However, there is hope ... I told myself that the films that follow are getting better and better. So, in conclusion, I have to say that this film does not deserve a movie screen, but it can be quite a lazy afternoon.
