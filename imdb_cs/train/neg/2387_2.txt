I could not believe how lame and unnecessary it was. Basically, there's nothing to laugh in the movie, almost no scenes that interest you in the rest of the movie. This movie stretched out in some huge stars, but in my opinion they were all unnecessary. I think Keanu Reeves had to give several acting lessons after watching the film a few years after watching the movie. Uma Thurman looked very simple and humble. Fortunately, I got this movie at a very low price because it is definitely not a movie I remember for good reasons. I'm not going to write anything about the story about the movie, but how do you know it's supposed to be the most famous hunter all over America for a huge thumb. I give this movie 2/10. Before I watched this movie, I wondered why this movie had only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very disappointed film. Do not buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
