My mother has been working with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention sharing the office with him. When it was announced that she was BTK, she was shocked. All the day was just her narrative stories of how she'd never seen him like Wichita Killer. I heard I would say it repeatedly. I asked her about many things and went to all the interviews she had been asked. I have read the entire book about Raider, Wichita is my hometown, and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. It was another BTK movie on TV not so long ago, and I thought it would be better if it portrayed the murder of Dennis, maybe even some intelligent questions about his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. This is based on how my mom portrayed, all my reading on it, and the video tapes I have seen from her talk. <br /> <br /> First, the angles of the camera were terrible. It looked like it was shot on a home video camera. The game was terrible and I could not even watch it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was "watching the rules of the book". He was not as cute as the movie he looked like was very polite and sudden as if it were. The same goes for his murders if we all know him. If you have seen his confession in court, you can already argue. And as for the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No. I have never read or Dennis Raider has admitted that he has a problem with the cruelty of animals or people who are out of the question. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for methods of suffocation. But he'd put the animals in the face of his victim all over the movie and behaved as if he cared for their well-being. Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew he admitted, but in the film in his first killing he says a lady whom he also knows. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to go to this movie and I'm guessing. This is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual BTK. This is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want to badly shoot half the porn with some defeat scenes, they would hand it over, then it's your kind of movie.
