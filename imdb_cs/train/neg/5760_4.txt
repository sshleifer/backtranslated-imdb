Well ... I'll wait for the video to appear to see it, and I wish I had it, in fact I caught the scary movie 2 on the cable the other day, and it made me long for more of what I was I got AIRPLANE to CRACK ... I think if you like airplane or some other Leslie nielsen cars then you'll probably be in the sky but if you're used to the usual WAYANS COMEDY, then you'll be disappointed there was a lot more eye candy in this one will keep young hormone furious teen boys happy, which is probably why it was a box office hit in the first week it came out. I had a scary movie 2 ten times more than this feed, and I had a fraction of that. Special that the better of 3 is part 2, but then I always enjoyed Halloween 2 better than the original as well ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the film must be the way the aliens say goodbye. But it was not paid for the $ 11 I spent with my fianc√©. Save your cash and capture part 2 again on the cable until it is released on the videotape and then lend it, do not buy it.
