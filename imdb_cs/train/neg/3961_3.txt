What a dog of the movie. The performance of the Noni Hazelhursta is pretty good, but he sits in the middle of the jungle of the rebellious screenwriter, the average direction, and the cast of great actors. Many of the characters are miserably miscast, especially still overvalued by Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little work in this demanding garbage. Most "character development" is done in a stupid, angry voice and often completely contradicts the character's behavior on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even find out who the voices say, because they describe the different characters we see on the screen! How do we want to know that Colin Friels (Javo) is supposed to be a shameful, violent and unreliable addict? One of those silly voice commands tells us. For loud crying, the character of his character is half the point of the film and the only thing that lets us know is a surprised voice! The real killer is a character. Everything about them. Their dresses are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the stand, despite the fact that we have constantly reminded us that artists should be poor. They are all absurdly well spoken for "junkies". It seems that none of them have a real understanding of life on slides or sinking, and yet it is understood by most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip deserves more attention than a weekly TV movie matinee. Such a crude, perfectly shot and technically superior but cliche-driven anxiety drama that shoots so wide to be plausible and meanders for hours without really going anywhere. At the very least, Noni gets every birthday occasion. There is no other reasonable reason to withstand this waste.
