For those looking for a sequel to the gentle South African miniseries of the 1980s, it's not. This is not a historical drama either. Rather, it's a terrific little fantasy that has nothing to do with historical Shaku, but uses only his name to play a role in Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero, a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there is a few laughs, like when Shaka breaks a cross to which he is connected and kicks a serious slave ass. You know as if Jesus did it if he was not such a bastard. True, I've only seen the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much of that bull would be better. And what kind of name is Mungo ?!
