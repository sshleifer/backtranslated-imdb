A really horrible movie. That can be expected. Clearly low budget: nothing innovative, actress (if you can call, what does "acting") always have on the role of nakedness on the scene, the man in a creeping suit almost modeled on predator, forests, etc. But there are some redeemed points. Although the story is not new, for the most part there are several parts that are not so regurgitated. For one, the black guy does not disappear when he attacks them (for the first time) and he's not one of the first few to die. But that's tiny. More importantly, it is a very interesting step in the attempts of Kat and Wes & Steve that I have not seen. When Steve told Kat that he knew what he was doing, I believed what he was saying and what Kat was saying. But when the creature revealed who is really, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of this revelation. It could have been because of my lack of experience with this genre, or that it was a really clever corner. Either way, the movie is pretty bad and do not see if there's anything better to ... If you're not in the mood for cheap science fiction movies.
