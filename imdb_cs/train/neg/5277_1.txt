I caught up tonight on Showtime and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting premise could end up so incredibly terrible. WHO IS YOUR DAD? stars Brandon Davis as an accepted high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to the porn realm that his biological parents have left him. Although the film seems to be a lot of fun, it is ruined by filthy directing director Andy Fickman, a clich√© and a predictable script, and it is even bad according to the standards of direct video. Even the normally humorous Charlie Talbert becomes the best friend in a surprisingly modest performance. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unhappy fool. 1/10
