I really do not like taking that movie. It is mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative, and avoids many great problems - Nash's affairs and his prejudice to sex with men in public places. I think it's just about tolerance in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie, but what about all the praises for Russell Crowe's performance? Man seems to be stirring up, holding a briefcase and wearing an eccentric hat and somehow seems to qualify as a fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental illness will realize that Crowe's performance is almost cartoon. It is also quite insulting. And I dare say, just to the right, that I'm really terrible
