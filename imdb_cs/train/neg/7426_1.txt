I could not believe it. I had to wipe my eyes several times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield, and Tracy Scoggins - all have some talents, but here they all were basically adding to Cinemax (Alien Intruder) trying to be unique with a computer virus / alien demon / harp / anything else you want to name Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this kind of high-tech virtual reality station aboard a spaceship where four men are allowed to live their fantasies because the system is overlooked by their Captain (Williams). Interestingly? Maybe, but here everything is played as a stuffed episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams eliminates everything to the right and left and seems to prefer to do something else, anywhere else. Oh, what people do for money ... FX are quite static, maybe even less than what you would expect on a cheap videotape like this. Unfortunately, even female nudity is smaller than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star here and of course it gets ALL the best scenes. If you like a movie that is teasing and without a brain, look at the "Alien Intruder". Of course you will probably have to look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. No stars, no matter what the stars can bring this film to. <br /> <br /> Let this lost in space.
