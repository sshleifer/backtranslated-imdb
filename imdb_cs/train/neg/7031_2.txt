What made me watch this picture was by viewing Vampyres, I thought I had to get more of the films that this guy (Larroz) did, I was sorry to watch, it's a weak attempt at an occult / satanic film loaded with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, that's the justification for the sleaze.) The only spitting factor was the setting and the atmosphere, they avoided it too bothered what it means, I welcome the release of the grind house. I hope she has some other movies that live up to Vampyres, Oh, and the goat scene was very boring, I understand it's what drives the hype.
