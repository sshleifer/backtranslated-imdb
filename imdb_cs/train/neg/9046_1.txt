Now for the truth, a very very weak story - for Walt Disney's film his complete waste. When Robinson appeared, movies all over the place, I was shocked at how bad it was. I like it like "alice in wonderland". It sounds like they have no ideas, some of them have ruffled some crazy rubbish to try to get away - and not. Then I sat there and wanted the end. My younger brother lost interest in half and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the Robinsons appear, you do not care about the end, just let the movie finish. His film forgets and quickly forgets. If you have some free time, do not waste it.
