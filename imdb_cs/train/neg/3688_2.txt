As usual, I went to watch this film for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film because he would be successful. Fortunately or unfortunately, the film was a failure. He then released a hit with Chandramukhi. He is not waiting for me on his approaching Shiva. I read the other user's comment on Rajni. I find it interesting because the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who acts, I think of my heart not from the mind. He is not a methodical actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age. Any way I need to fill out 10 lines for this comment ... so I wish for luck Rajni ...... .....
