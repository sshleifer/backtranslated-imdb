This film is barely good, not at all big. Several memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice of pairing Norm Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell does it all for her, Marilyn's younger wife and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered to be one of the most important points of his fragile career. 3/10
