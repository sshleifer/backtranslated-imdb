I will be as short as this piece of crap barely justifies mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever shot - right there with other menacing zombies - Schmid Zombies - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films set so badly that anyone involved in their production should be shot. Somehow I managed to sit down ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so awkward - even when compared to another terrible movie by Schnaas, that I had to go through the first 10 minutes quickly. Zero acting skills, awkward gore, awesome camera-style camera, funny dabing ... it just goes on and on. I really can not find one thing to buy this waste - and I will find something I'll buy in almost every movie. It really is one of the worst movies ever he has ever done - You were warned ... 1/10
