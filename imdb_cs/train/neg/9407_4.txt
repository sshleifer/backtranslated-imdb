"Houseboat Horror" is often considered to be the worst Australian film ever created and described as a typical movie slasher that carried the "See a movie that can not win the Academy Award". Underground members of the discotheque begin to die on the death of a burnt maniac while attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. He has a lot of acted and wrote a movie slasher with zero tension and annoying characters. It certainly adds gore: the heads are divided in half with a machete, the throat is cut and the woman is killed with horseshoes. If you love cheese slasher movies you can give this one one try, but you were warned. it's better than the Swedish "Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
