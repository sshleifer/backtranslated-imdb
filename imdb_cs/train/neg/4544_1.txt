This movie just is not worth your time. His reliance on New-Western mysticism serves as the only semi-interesting distraction. This conspiracy is the one repeatedly repeated. <br /> <br /> I was only invited to even spend time commenting when I remarked that some were trying to support the reputation of this blabber. Their motivation and objectivity are doubtful because they encourage you not to look at the mistakes of the film, but on its well thought out message about New Age consciousness. <br /> <br /> Would it be right for twenty to thirty evangelical Christians or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour positive reviews of movies / televisions that support their views? Despite the poor production quality or the lack of truth in any assumed historical background? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers will come directly to me to say about the flower things about this movie, despite the truth.
