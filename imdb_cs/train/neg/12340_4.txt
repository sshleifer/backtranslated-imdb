"Transylvania 6-5000" is a negligible but sometimes funny and charming horror parody in the mid-eighties, with several well-known names in the cast and a handful of real laughter opportunities in the script. Two Bozo journalists from small tabloids are sent to Transylvania, very against their will, to tell about the alleged return of Mad Scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little tricks and details that appear to the left and right of the film, like a small guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and lab tubes that are used to put cream and sugar for breakfast. A healthy film, however, is not as successful as it could and should be, with jokes and parodies that are too long. Roger Corman's "Transylvania Twist," which appeared four years later, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodied by the classic universal milestones of the early 1930s, so make sure you've seen them if you want to grab all the little gags and links. There is a quite original procedure that suggests that Frankenstein's character behaves like a bad scientist of evil when he enters the lab. It is also obvious that he is actually more than Father Damien, a messiah who only deals with the state of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the weird guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, plays as a psychotic valet, who appears and disappears in the most unfavorable moments. I'm sure the character of John Turturo in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by Richards' role here.
