Here's another bloody European story that explodes the religion of their country. (These atheistic filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see the brutal firing of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). This really won the Oscar for foreign film. This is probably because the story made Catholics and religious beliefs in general very weak. One of the main characters is the priest and he is more concerned with food than with anything else. He is portrayed as nothing but an idiot. It's no surprise that this section was dominated by the secular film The Academy loved this film. There is also a surprising fool playing a guy who renounces his religion to take one of the four daughters in the story. Daughters alternately seduce student "seminars" (who says he studied for six years, but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how is the film being crooked? This is shame and another excellent example of a secular-progressive bigotry of film bizarre, global (not just Hollywood).
