No words can describe my utter hatred for this terrible release of the BTK killer. The rating of this film is one of the ten compliments of this truly catastrophic excuse for the film. There was no single highlight from start to finish. The whole thing was horribly connected; scenario, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. Several scenes are literally mixed-loud-funny, for the horrifying way the whole thing is connected. This review may seem like an unfair and humiliating attack on a low-budget movie, but that's not the case. Just thinking about the movie I just saw is starting to breed blood. As this movie was ever released, I will never know. I'm almost tempted to really recommend BTK because it's really exceptional in terms of how pathetic and disturbingly horrible. I can honestly say that in all of my films it's the worst. FILM. AT ALL. I spent an hour of my life on this unnecessary garbage and I'd like to jump out of the nearest building beforehand if I knew why I was. ZERO of TEN.
