This is not really a good review because I did not see most of the movie. I stopped watching her. The film is very violent, with ugly drug dealers and street punks, but this is no reason why I stopped watching. Here was the problem: I looked so much to be introduced to several characters, they were not all interesting. They were all boring, scornful of psychopaths, without any personality that would have nothing to expect. I did not find even a little curious about what to do next or what might happen to them. If there was one more person interested, and I do not think the good or the nice guy, I mean an interesting person, I could stay with her. Watch "the state of grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, the character of Gary Oldman is a complete fool but is * very * interesting. Al Pacino might have done a good job at Scarface, but his character just did not care.
