I noticed that the previous reviewer (who still seems to be in school) gave this film a very good overview, and I can assume it is because the reviewer did not see a much better BBC adaptation of this classical novel in 1989. The main problem that I had with this (1999) version, cast Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who set out for glory after appearing on the television mini-series "The Choir." I can only assume that he was worthy of Tom Dona's role due to the power of his excellent acting in the "Choir." Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in the "Choir" became the movie "Tom's Midnight Garden" and as such Anthony could not convince Tom as a schoolboy. It's too far from imagination to believe Tom (as played by Anthony) could be friends with a much younger Hatty. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty are much closer to their age and the development of their friendship is far more plausible. For the 1999 film, even special effects can not convince and there is no noticeable improvement in television effects in 1989. Casting and playing this version are lower than previous adaptations, and in all the films there was a lacking shiny version of real classics. As a final observation, I would point out that the BBC VHS version of 1989 brings over 20 pounds per second while the new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than Â£ 5.00, do I need to say more?
