Be brutally honest ... I loved Severed. That's why I gave her 1/10 stars because of her unlimited story / shooting / acting / everything. This movie was watched by RIOT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story does not really matter, it's a guy who's bald and has a sword and walks on his head with random people. <br /> <br /> But it has a supernatural procedure ... no one ever sees it. <br /> <br /> Even if a nightclub gets into a nightclub with a jampoo in a very unforgettable scene and throws out the girl's noodles and nobody will see her. <br /> <br /> Separated does not just look like it was shot on a video - it was shot on your home camcorder. The filmmakers have had knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and the composition actually holds in some scenes. But mostly you can not hear the actors ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when another victory gets your pumpkin separated from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and hunt this movie. Supporting movies like this are a girl and a girl!
