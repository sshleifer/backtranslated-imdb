Tyson <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Reverend - Even Anxiously Fair - Due to Life and Time Champion Boxer Mike Tyson . Because of his conviction for rape, the film is careful to portray him as a hero or villain, but he pains a wart-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success, and people who shaped his fate forever or badly. Restricted by the deadlines, the script goes through a sequence of important details, briefly appearing on major events, culminating with Tyson's (temporary) fall in 1995. The newcomer will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will entertain director Uli Edel's straight - deep access to the material. It expresses Tyson's life as a circus, in which he was ultimately deceived by the circumstances of his own success. The script actually reserves most of his poison to Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, who characterizes her as an ungrateful goldsmith who used his naivete. The production values ​​are uniform and the cast is excellent: Michael Jai White makes a fair imitation of the title; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato in acres of toothy teeth; and Paul Winfield was born to play Don King!
