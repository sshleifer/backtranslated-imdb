When many people say it's "the worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say it's almost no movie they did not like. However, out of nearly 700 films I can remember, I see that this is one of two that I have turned away from a feeling of personal insult and indignation. This is my first film exploration, by the way, and I registered with IMDb just to be afraid of the badness of this film. I went to see it when it was in the theaters (I and my two buddies were 3 out of 5 people) and after 15 years I do not remember many specifics, but my attitude to leaving the theater is still clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Fat loser to the left on the altar, go to the ski weekend, meet the blonde bomb that is interested in him, take him home to meet his family, they are all cannibals and it's the main course, a pathetic attempt to dramatic escape, ass and running away with my brother's girlfriend, they live happily after all. Puke. First of all, gags are so bad that it took me a while to realize that they are trying to be FUNNY and that it was a comedy. Special effects, which few people look like it was 15 years ago. The big dramatic end was so hockey and he behaved badly that it's almost unbearable to watch (he'll kick off the entire cannibal family with the games that are on the lawn that stand Tom and Jerry's style when they step on them). I'm sure there is a lot, much more, but I do not intend to see again that it will repeat.
