What this film does not match is that this war is bad (and most of the US wars have just gotten to get some oil). How many innocent civilian casualties were, how many lives were perished, and how ugly the perpetrators were stupid. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if a US soldier kills women and children except an enemy, it's ok but if the government accidentally kills its own power with deadly chemicals and kills many civilians Well it's not ? Your logic fails, gentleman. I'll give it 5 for a solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
