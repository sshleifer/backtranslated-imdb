I can kindly recall Bo Derek's bloom and the attention of the UK press (especially on the Sun & News of the World documentary) - everyone is watching her little role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Of course, there was a lot of confusion from her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed reflective breasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is and has never been her strength! I think they should do one of the triple collections they always find in the shopping cart - Orca, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All of these films can be nominated for "So Bad That They Are Great". It would be guilty for me "I have to buy"! If you ever read your press or this comment by Mrs. Derek, please do not be offended - You've always had a weak spot for you and more important things are being done in the world that you can worry about than your acting ability. Much Love.x
