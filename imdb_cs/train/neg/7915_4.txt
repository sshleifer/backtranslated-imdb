All the X-Men movies were great. And I think it all, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They have solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion) and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited to hear that this movie was in production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger than I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is The Fountain, though you will not hear about this movie when he talks about actors), and his acting is not what films are filming. The whole movie is exposed to a lot of nonsensical characters who do not add anything to a conspiracy (such as Blob or Gambit) and that fans believe that filmmakers should read original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories, and none of these films have been respected by this movie. None. Neither continuity. Does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, motivation for a wolf dog is simply stupid and seen in millions of films: Revenge of the Death of a Loved One. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting was the whole of Barlocker's moment for Wolverine similar to that of the X2 at school when Stryker's men came and he destroys enemy forces but hey, that's Fox, you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and fearsome hero Marvel. Besides, I had a constant feeling about this movie because Wolverine's Origins are already explained in the X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton, so it makes no sense to make a movie about something we already know. I personally believe that the werewolf is one of those few characters who do not need a solid story because the mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how Joker got his scars?
