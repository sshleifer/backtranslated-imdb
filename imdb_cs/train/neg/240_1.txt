I never liked commenting on a good film, but when it comes to bad film, I really have to do it. When we talk about Vivah, it seems that this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, has completely lost it. After success, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun thought he could make money with cheese wedding videos. Vivah is so noisy that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras. <br /> <br /> During the movie there was not the only time I could say, "Oh, at least the thing is good." Aloknath makes a clich√© in the role of Girls' father, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster ugly looking sets, bad costumes, frantic action, monstrous stepbrothers, experienced actors, cacophonic background music, cheaper soundtrack. Now the spoiler, I warn you that what happens in all of his other films, after the fatal incident of the film, ends with happy notes.
