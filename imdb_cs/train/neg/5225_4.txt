This entrance to Drummond lacks continuity. Most of them have their elements of stupidity, postponed weddings, and so on. But it has an endless series of events that occur in the near dark, because the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a town. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is so obvious a suspect no one even seems to be. He's a stranger and he's rather suspicious, but Drummond and people probably do not get anything. It's still a fairly good event and a pretty good ending. I know Algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone Sherlock Holmes, he's so crazy that it's hard to imagine anyone with a taste or intelligence around him. Is there a history that would explain how Drummond became co-workers?
