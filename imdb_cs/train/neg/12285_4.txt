The story is absurd and lame, as well as sucking is performance and dialogue, it's hard to keep your eyes open. I encourage you to have a caffeine-driven friend to wake you up in time for a few Gore effects. Why is Alcatraz bringing? In this case, it is becoming more and more difficult to swallow. All the time I was wondering who the film is heading for? Withers full of chrome subplots (eg Canadian US Army Captain) It is of low quality in every aspect.BTW this film is forbidden in Germany !!
