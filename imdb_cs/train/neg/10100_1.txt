I usually support independent art and I try to be very complex and tolerant ... I'm used to supporting everyone because their efforts are worth it ... but this film just turns away from all understanding and tolerance of the limit! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the truly horror movie you've ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some great, attractive ART for the DVD box of this movie ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you will get ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> See it only if you really have nothing to do. Everything is better.
