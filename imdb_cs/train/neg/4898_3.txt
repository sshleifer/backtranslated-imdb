Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film you can watch. Desperately mysterious, every cut is like a work of art. You get the impression that the composition of each fringe has been designed and prepared with a certain level of excellent care that borders on obsession; Explaining how far cinematography has progressed since the first films fired in the nineteenth century and imitated their design, the camera almost never moves? except the camp and color musical numbers. The noise in the neighborhood is minimal and few words are spoken. This curious but effective device will force viewers to focus their attention only on visual stimuli, so even though the story progresses at a pace that resembles a snail, we feel submerged. Unfortunately, for me, at least this immersion will begin to uncovered around an hour. I began to feel as if the film forced me to keep watch while it became more difficult when the minutes stretched so that the mere act of observation became a struggle of will. If the content of this film was as sexual as it would undoubtedly be even more obscure to the western audience. As such, there is nudity and sexual abuse of the unconscious (or perhaps dead) woman who is so vile that even though she can talk about the amount of degradation that pornography affects both men and women (users and used) is so overly keen on how it decides to make its point of view that it effectively disables it. Of course, the worst and most excited blast participants in the available pornographic content will look for this movie for all the wrong reasons and look at it with a sticky finger on the quick remote button on the remote control. <br /> <br /> In all its problems, the film is definitely the one that remains, and the more you think about it, the more senses it seems to some of its aspects. It is ironic that for a movie in which so little is happening, the viewer would probably have been rewarded by watching the second or third time. Was it enough for me?
