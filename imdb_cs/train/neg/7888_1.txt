he did not know anything about the movie or it was based on the best-selling book. He tried to guess from the opening scenes, what was it about, the best estimate, buried treasure and death list. It took about 15 minutes when I got a tricky suspicion that the movie is crap. I will not bore you how bad plot and acting are, but anyone who has given him more than two stars has to work for movie makers. I watched when the hero jumped into his corvette to hurry the hospital. He wore a suit, shirt and tie that came to the hospital in jeans and shirt. She could not even get the continuity to the right. I got a Christian theme, it's hard to miss it.
