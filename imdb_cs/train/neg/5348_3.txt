Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is going to donate his Smithsonian Institution's shrinking / expanding machine because he and his wife Diana (Eve Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend from their son Adam (Bug Hall). Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) voluntarily take care of Adam while his parents are gone, but as luck would it led you to expectation), adults were accidentally lit by Wayne's shrinking beam. As children run amok, their miniaturized people have to face huge huge insects, carpet wrinkles that look like canyons and other threats for them. It was bad as most directly on the video sequences are, honey, we shrunk we laughed a little. I had to laugh that the movie "roach" Stuart Pankin and party bullying were even more ridiculous, look at your own danger!
