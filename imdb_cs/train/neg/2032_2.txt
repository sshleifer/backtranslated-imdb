I gave two stars for the amazing clarity of the DV shot, which features a cool and dark sterility of its character. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I can not recommend it because it is neither poetic nor dull. Not dramatic nor exciting. Not controversial, nor ordinary. It's just a terrible piece of waste that no horror or explosion fan can recommend in good faith. Do not look at whoever you are. . .Please, be out of this terrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
