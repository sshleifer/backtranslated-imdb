Ted V. Mikels' Corpse Grinders 2 is a 103-minute tugging film. This conspiracy is rather a mix of pointless business dealings between people who grind corpses in cat food, while cats aliens who are losing war with dog aliens and wanting to get some of the cat food. While watching this film, I started looking for any sort of distraction, anything I could make sure I was doing something other than losing my mind from the inside out. Several scenes go a long way, as the characters insist on making simple things forever. I have heard that Mr Mikels does not like to use jumps too often because they are afraid they are confusing their audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". Try not to force myself to take care of some of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast, and maybe with the exception of the old men who are factory managers. Most of the cast are amateurs without talent who do not even bother to learn the words "Amazing Grace" before they sing to her camera. Though guilt may be due to poor sound quality, because I actually heard about 80% of the dialogue when watching a DVD. This is quite possibly the worst movie ever shot. I listened to the excerpts from the comment and Mr. Mikels looks like a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell is he doing to make such a waste? I would like to hear an explanation from the old men who had to lie without a shirt on the metallic conveyor belt waiting for them to be deployed. Movies that I've long ago hated seem to be much better. I long for constantly adapted to the Excalibur music and Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, anything. You do not see this movie.
