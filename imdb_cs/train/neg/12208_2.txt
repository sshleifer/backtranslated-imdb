As a military veteran I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. I said that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this bullshit is an understatement. If the film was introduced as a satir or even as a cartoon (it was), it would be better accepted. But it was taken seriously by my many people, especially overseas. Foolishly, as it sounds, wherever I went to Europe in the 1980s, it seemed to me that people and Americans generally judge me with this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, we'll see. The monosyllabic cretin, which is connected to the muscles, is pulled from prison to go to a secret mission to North Asia to release some American prisoners of war. In the running battle, he will kill about 500 enemy soldiers with the M-60 machine gun, which never gets out of the ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held with one arm. I could go on, but I have headaches. I gave it only 2/10, because it is a little better than Rambo III.
