Three Stoogs in Western Comedy-Musical? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was supposed to serve as a comedy Stooges short with Western musical in matinee; If so, it was a nice way to say goodbye to Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (like Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as a blonde in June) and Gladys Blake (like Betty brunette) are pretty women. Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonic group; their songs are quite melodic; However, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the movie is not exactly "rock". There are a few laughs; but Stooges humor is more damp than usual. The talking horse is also inadequately used. <br /> <br /> Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
