Charged as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is fake. As someone born in Sheffield and still with links to the city, I was very disappointed with this film. Someone said it might be in Oklahoma, and it probably sums it up. It looked like a romantic view of northern England, which was for the American market. Probably many Americans - and many South Africans - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of half a million people, with sophisticated urban culture. Among the giants, he was portrayed as some gloomy Sunday half-moon town, where everyone in Sheffield remembered drinking at the same old-fashioned pub and where the popular idea of ​​party dancer in a village looked like. It was a small, narrow-gauge community, not a metropolitan city. The working men from Sheffield were totally unlike their real counterparts, who are generally silent and communicate with each other in horror and short dry notes. They do not say, and they will not sing in the churches. Even the rural environment, probably in the Peak district, looked alien to me. I recognized a few places where I went hiking, but some of the aerial footage of the masts that stretched across the landscape reminded me of more Wales. In fact, in the credits at the end I saw a link to Gwynedd, Wales. Peak District is in the summer crawling with foot soldiers and tourists in the car. It is located between two large cities. It's not some wildlife. As for the idea that a young woman could love and a desire for Pete Postlethwaite, that was ridiculous and could only be a male dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover were never clear. None of the men were exposed as a partner or family; they existed in a vacuum. Anyone who wanted to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders would be raised. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of writers and middle class creators. <br /> <br /> It was a huge fake! <br /> <br />
