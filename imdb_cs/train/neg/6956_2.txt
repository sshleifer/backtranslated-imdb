I'm sorry, but every time I see a movie in which a woman sucks - a man hits and the man does nothing but kneeling, the film loses all credibility. So the new (woman) Starbuck immediately commented on the conspiracy before she even got out of the ground (no toy was intended). Dirk Benedikt was far more likely than a sensitive hero than the new catharist Kattee Sackhoff - whose overcoming is likely to continue to be praised as a "convincing, exciting, necessary, pioneering performance" to politically correct new talk about today's review copier editors; but basically it's just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on a shoulder as big as a town house: the biggest clich√© on the screens today. I can give this series one more shot, but human cartoons will not hold me. As James Hilton first cried, "A story, please give me a story."
