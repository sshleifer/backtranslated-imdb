This film seems to send the wrong message. There can be morality without the use of Christ. A person of other religions, in my opinion, can get to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to the church every week, but I disagree with such Christian arrogance. This is the worst travel film I've ever seen and I've seen Timeline.
