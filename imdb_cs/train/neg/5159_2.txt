Watching this movie is like eating a feast nothing but a slap. At first it looks great, but in the end it does not provide any satisfaction - none. The conspiracy is a confused mess about the factory and the toys of evil. How is it possible that with this basic plot and Robin Williams, the film still looks so bad? This is because the picture is ubiquitous without any content - just like the terrible image of Popey, who made Williams at the beginning of his film career. The film had to be fortunate, but maybe there was not enough money to hire writers who attended high school. The film is one unlucky joke that goes on and on and on and on. I'm really not sure why this happened in the first place - it certainly was not the cause of any entertainment.
