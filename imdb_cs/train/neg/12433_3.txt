I like to make my comments short and simple, but this almost summarizes. You can not beat the original two for many reasons, one of which including talented director Chris Columbus. This film has been a terrible direction overwhelmed by even more terrible gaming. I cant believe that these people are considered an actor. <br /> <br /> Pain to sit and watch. Give it a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a carefully trained task. Worse, hire one of the original lifts and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The film was not even set up during the Christmas season. Home Alone turned from an excellent Christmas family comedy movie to a joke without morale or plot!
