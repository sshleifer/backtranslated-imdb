Oh, my God, what the hell happened ?! I do not want to say that again, but what kind of backfire is that? Dabing in this case is worst than dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and suits are really cheesy. Its a rascal called Dr.Who who gets followers to build a robot gorilla that has the same like King Kong, but when the robot breaks down, he builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When she does (that's Linda Miller annoying), Congo does her slaves, but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes. After Dr. Sends the robot after him. Later, when I was watching the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started to run. Since I was sitting in a miserable DVD watching while playing, I was hoping the madness in the movie would end up fighting. The end should be really bad because they could once again show Kong on their island again to fight the dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if you ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
