This movie looked as if it were good at the beginning, but never did not match expectations. The director is talented and has good camera angles and artistic thoughts (typical of Asian directors), but he can not even create or tell a good story that might be with him. The story was fragmented, and it seemed to be moving in various directions across the film, and never found a solid, explicable and interesting angle. Basically, the film never responds to explanations in a press release. The game was very good. All the actors gave good performances and Jude Law was excellent as he always is. It's bad he decided to make such a faint movie.
