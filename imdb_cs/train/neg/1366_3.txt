** THE SPOILERS CONTAIN ** <br /> <br /> Really beautiful Sean Young (who looks something like Elizabeth Taylor in some scenes, with her hair raised) is amazing in her opening moments in this movie. Sitting in the back of the police car, waiting for a bust signal, her face and body tense and scattered. Unfortunately, once the bust over Young's tense attitude is never changed. It's one deadly blocked actress. One just has to compare Young with the artist playing his co-workers and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what's missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional and always in peace ... in that there is no apparent obstacle between what she can feel and her expression. It's an open book. Young, on the other hand, is acting modestly and confidently, as you can expect your neighbor to act when he suddenly plays in the film. Basically it has no trace. With this main emptiness, which appears in the middle of the movie, we are busy over stunning stories. For example, when Miss Young is kidnapped by a criminal who is locked up and locked in a closet, she breaks the door down when she is deserted. Although she is dressed only in her bra and panties, but in a similar situation when the psychopath returns for a moment, you go to the door ... or will you have time to go over his wardrobe, pull out some clothes and get dressed? I think this and other scenes are trying to imply some mixed emotions that Miss Young is experiencing, but youngsters can not tell this kind of complexity. There are a few influential moments in the film, such as brief police interviews with past victims of the crime, but it is a worthless effort overall. It's a terrible thing that Miss Young has been replaced when shooting a few comic-like movies that could humorously abuse her limitations (BATMAN and DICK TRACY) because she touches her wildly when she tries to play real people. Watching Miss Young is trying to act, at least in this "thriller," it's a sad spectacle.
