Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. The worst actress ever. No really the worst deal. David Hess (the last house on the left - not the 1970s - it's really good rent) is the worst of the bundle (quite stiff competition, but it is terribly terrible). find a home movie enthusiast with such an uncomfortable presence of the camera. The film actually grins to a stunning painful stop when it's on the screen. It's not that the movie really has some redeemed features to destroy Mr. Hess. It is shot with a home camera and looks like it is quite old and it is equipped with a connected boom mike. No postproduction either. Come there must be a shovel that could be used by the five year old computer that could clean up this picture. Throw in bizarre photography with autopsy and airborne take-offs, and this is one of the visually shuffled shots. Images of autopsy are captured in the way that Italian Cannibal films interfere with those painful killing of animals in real life. The naval record should be some anti-war statement (Because we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs have joined the Navy). What in the world is the Lion Gate doing release of this waste? It would be Troma embarrassed. It seems like it's Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry? The one from the 1970s? Let's rent it really good) Someone is shot in LA's stomach and the cops assume that Zombie Killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where the relationship of a young man's killer reminds of the relationship of the congressman and the congressman? Yeah, the 1980s and production values ​​meet the Nambla subplot. Sign me up.
