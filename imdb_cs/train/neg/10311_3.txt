SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgotten action movie Lorenzo Lamas does the usual heavy guys and a handsome boy, and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot Alex cats. OJ Simpson is a detective who stayed behind his disappeared genius public figure. Translation: cable television. There is not enough skin to be considered Guilty Pleasure. The script has some holes. Best / worst moment: In one rough scene, the official's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ. Lead. It responds that some organs are quite hot, or words in this sense. This vague necrophilia is sufficiently insulting; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film it's really scary and therefore funny, unintentionally, terribly. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now it is the pleasure of wine. BC
