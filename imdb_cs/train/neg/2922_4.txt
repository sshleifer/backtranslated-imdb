Take the young, nice people, put them in an exotic environment, hold on to a few bad guys, have two main characters to find romance after a few heavy breathing scenes, create the smallest of parcels, then work out a happy end for everyone (other than three or four who are murdered, of course) This is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. It's not very good, but it's not as bad as most small yellow pocket books. And an interesting location in Budapest is especially interesting, although they do not use the beautiful old train station (designed by Gustav Eifel) or represent the famous thermal spa town.
