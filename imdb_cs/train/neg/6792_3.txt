Here's a good-filled movie and a nice-looking job on the ground, but you just do not. Director Richard Brooks had to be a little tired at this stage of the game; What better is his PROFESSIONAL! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to slow down even during scenes without slowing down. This movie had to be truncated if ever. The horse was terrified of a terribly fake and obvious tire in those desert watching moments - just lazy. negligent work. Very bad. The actors did it well, but I certainly saw that everyone was doing better. Ben Johnson is always happy. I first saw this film almost 30 years ago; was disappointed and remained on the second look 30 years later.
