If this is based on a real life relationship between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinsons, I'm excited to be personally unaware of it. This is painfully slow and both characters are relentlessly released in the film while the theme song is played in the ground. Many stupid scenes with stupid people do not mean comedy.
