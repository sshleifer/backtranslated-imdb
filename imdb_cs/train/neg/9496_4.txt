The unusual romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about a loving relationship that has grown between the golden years between the loving hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles (William Holden surprisingly enjoyable within this very fanciful arrangement). The script is mild, but not without some thoughtful passages; the screenplay is such a middle-aged clich√© that most of the image looks small. It could have worked much better in a number of ways: Holden and Lenz do not agree well (her character is so mild, she seems to be spinning), which intimate scenes are less mixed than uncomfortable. Dates, blurred-romantic and mostly unforgettable. ** z ****
