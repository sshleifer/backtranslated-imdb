Should she start? This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever paid for good money. I will not comment on the story myself, it's a beautiful classic, but here's like a soap opera. First, acting, with the exception of Eric Ban, is the quality of a soap opera. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every Actor on The Bold and Krásná betray him. Also, camera action will not help. How it insists on him when he thinks it will just take me back to Brooke Forrester's hours in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either a really bad plastic surgery or desperately needs one. Either way, she looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And at the end of my remarks, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she's definitely not Helen Troy. Peterson was more likely to choose for his role as Saffron Burrows, because Elizabeth Taylor would rather be a miscast.
