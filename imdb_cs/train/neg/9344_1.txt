As others have pointed out that this film is a burden of tedious disgust for the homeless or masochist. We all know that after seeing the line and sour house, Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the First World. But unlike trainspotting and a sour house without a good dose of humor or brazen realism, movies do not work like this. And even more importantly, without a decent screenplay the movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspirational or thought provoking script for this movie. The fact that this film has earned a couple of Bafta shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie film industry was bad at the moment, but unfortunately, the British industry is even worse. This movie is so bad that I would not even worry about renting it from the weekly section. > <br /> Make a favor and make this film a great place.
