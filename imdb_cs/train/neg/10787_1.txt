Let me put it another way: ball. Or, what's wrong with us? That's really terrible, more embarrassing than those they're trying to open. Julia Roberts is an experienced actress and her work is usually the highest. This film is so lacking in the direction, and she tries to look good. It's usually a professional, but I swear that there were signs of confusion and despair in her eyes. The only thing that could save this step was the idea of ​​director (Chris Walken) shooting the film into a secret documentary about actors. Unfortunately, this topic has not been explored, as it is full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should hold acting. Two talented former Buffy stars had different experiences - Green hopelessly bad cast and Balfour unused. Well done to Julia, who tried to prevent it from being the worst movie ever shot.
