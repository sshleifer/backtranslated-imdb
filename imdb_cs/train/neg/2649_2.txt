My wife and I have begun to watch this movie with anticipation. It seemed warm and touching. It started well; but he soon became dull and frankly idiot. It's so bad that we turned them off The film was badly bred and honest, we could not understand or wanted to understand exactly why or how to get the hell out of this woman! You lost her compassion when it was rough and playing wackos singing and cleaning. I want to bind her. And, of course, like most T.V movies and serials made in Hollywood, we have to throw a token "gay" figure! This movie was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
