Bestsellers writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes over the task for Sports Illustrated. He has to go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try the third Quarterback. He is quickly discovered by team members featuring Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The entire team finds it fun to cause the writer's determination to get into the Quarterback for the show in a real game. This film is Ald's debut and also helped Karras to leave the grid for playing. In addition to 1968, Detroit Lions also took "Sugar Ray" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on Plimton's book.
