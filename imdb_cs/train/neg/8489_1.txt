Yes, in the 35 years of the movie, I finally saw the anger that overcame all the other terrible movies I've seen. Hitting "Good Will Loving 'Baise Moi' and 'Flirt' for the ultimate horror, this is a challenging first-tune bout ... not fun, and the effects are cheap and worse - unnecessary. Tilda Swinton covers a career full of empty wood with a performance that nervously intersects between comet and ridiculous "intensity." There seems to be some fool to let the director of this film do more .. be warned
