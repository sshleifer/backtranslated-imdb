We have a lake. We have a ruined animated meteor. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with fins. Well, let's just name this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie and Mitch to define the definitive definition of "comic relief". We also have a sheriff who does not really have a terrible thing in this movie and no one listens to. Aw crap, we're over the movies and we forgot to insert a bad guy! Do not be afraid, imagine a guy with a mustache, let him steal him and make sure he is a bad person, let him jump off somewhere near the lake, let him haunted by the forest and all for the sole purpose of ending up as a dinosaur refreshment. That should work. Complete, clumsy clutter, this movie. His logic will twist your mind to make you laugh. The first film introduced Dave Allen as the "leading stop motion". He then joined Charles Banda for several years until the mid-nineties, when the band got the money to pay for it. The effects of the dinosaurs are charming and the whole movie is pretty damn unintentionally entertaining. Unfortunately, this is probably the only good thing that can be said for that. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes. The logic of bending the mind in the narrative should be a good reason for it to appear on the list. If that's not the case, Arnie and Mitch will make a trick. 3/10 and 8/10
