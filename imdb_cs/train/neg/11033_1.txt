The latest sound that is going on is that Vh1 starts casting a call to I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. So does that mean Budah or Tailor from New York has cast, or does that mean New York has thrown out the winner? <br /> <br /> I know Flavor of Love is coming to third season, so now with Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... will it ever be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I have also heard several rumors that Chance will be brought back to the 3rd Season I Love New York !!!! I also heard rumors that New York will be specially featured on the flavor of love 3. Hopefully it was not too much spoiler for the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just having the last reputation.
