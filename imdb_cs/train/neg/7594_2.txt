Due to the history of this film's director, it's hard to believe it's such a painfully bad film. Last night I was at the European premiere and there was one of the executive producers. He had seen the movie and the boy was surprised. I have not read the book on which it is based, nor do I know whether it is highly rated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and, considering how badly it was adapted to the screen and how bad the film was, I can assume, that something like that happened here. The arrangement was not bad, even though there were a few - too much raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared about a character in this movie. The situation is displayed on the screen in a blank sequence of nullity. Donald Sutherland is part of several scenes where he opens the door, says something and closes it again. I was still looking at my watch when I did not turn the dialogue on the screen. I never went to the movie, but I was tempted to get started during it. I gave this movie a score of "2" for reasons that seemed terribly shallow but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the ubiquitous Earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek was naked and looked beautiful. I can say a little positive about this movie. Do not ask for anything, can not talk!
