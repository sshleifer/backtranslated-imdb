Some fun humor, someone's falling flat, some decent acting, someone who's pretty scary. This movie is just hit and miss, guaranteed to entertain 12-year-old boys more than any other place. <br /> <br /> Children's actors in the movie are simply unhappy. When you make a family comedy, it tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to deserve and dares to say, human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
