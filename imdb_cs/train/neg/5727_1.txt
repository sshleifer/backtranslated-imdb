I just want to start by making it the first review of the movie I made on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interviews with the director, he says he respects constructive criticism, so I try to avoid making the film just for that, and I have offered my views on why I thought it terribly terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know the budget may not have allowed great audiences, but Nicholson, who has been working in industry for more than a decade, surely knew some actors were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly lame make-up and special effects. Again, the budget seems to have interfered with what was originally intended, but after working on the fact that it has been being invented for so many years, there is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. Apparent similarity with the Host. While this is not exactly what will break away, it will certainly try to make the success of former films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... 4. Music. Not at all spooky or scary, not even bad just unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 5. Scenario in general. All dialogues were forced and horrible! Also, the partial drawings of the theater and the guy who came to save them were weak and almost like an idea. <br /> <br /> 6. Edit. WTF. How nasty and not good. Nuf said. I would really like to hear the director of the idea of ​​my contribution (he undoubtedly frequent his site on IMDb.) Causing a friend ... what did you think. Surely at some point during shooting or editing you have realized what turkey yol has on your hands ... I'm sorry I do not want to be cruel but you have to have more talents than I hope your other feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better, let's hope that practice makes progress. But at the same time avoid it as a plague. I want to go back 81 minutes with interest. (At least I did not pay to look at her.)
