John Leguizemo, an amazing comic actor, is a Latin New York musician who can get into countless characters, both men and women, to show the bizarre weakness of an ethnic group trying to cope with a foreign culture. He is not Italian. It does not seem, it is not considered or behaves Italian ... Especially Sicilian or Calabrese, immigrant groups living in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Every scene in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" circles falsely as if he was going through college production "West Side Story," while other boys make low rent "Mean Streets." This is just one problem with this poorly conceived, bad movement. Spike blew it out. Btw, CBGBOMFUG means "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and other music for uplifting gourmets [or maybe Gourmands] Ask Hilly Crystal who founded the club. <br /> <br />
