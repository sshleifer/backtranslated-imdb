Mostly I enjoyed this film, but I still felt I was looking at a children's film. I honestly think that someone wrote the pg script and then decided to add some blood, nudity and tongue while filming. it was a big break. there is that children believe the charm that exists in movies like "babe" (pig) or "angels in the outfield", which defeats evil faint teeth. the parents eventually believe their daughter about their ability to see the spirit and use this skill to supernatural defeat of the teeth. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-film reaction to the terrible darkness falling; somehow managed to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but not. they have made a worse film and probably lose the same share of money lost in the dark.
