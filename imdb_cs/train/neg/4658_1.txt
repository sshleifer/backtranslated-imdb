BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a haunted and unnecessary remake of David Lean's classic 1945, based on "Still Life" by Noel Coward. The doctor removes grainy granularity from the female eye at the railway station, is in a poor relationship, is a happily married social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance at other occasions, they are an instant attraction and they meet every Wednesday. The couple falls in love, but after spending a couple of afternoons together, they realize they have no realistic chance of happiness and they agree to become a part. Coward's original one-sided play concerned two ordinary people who fell in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and veterans of the Hollywood epic, are nowhere near the idea of ​​"ordinary people." Especially Loren is a miscast - Sophia Loren, in a full make-up, looking like a million dollars, works as a volunteer social worker at the Citizen Advice Bureau, just does not sound true. Burton, looking embarrassed, with colorful hair, too much make-up and footwear on the platform, does not look like your average GP. Let's say you really can not blame them for looking at your husbands. Burton married a literary critic who spends evenings with poisonous reviews and who is treated with complete contempt for her husband. Lorena's husband, Jack Hedley, is a whole day potter around the house and is totally boring: the most exciting thing he's ever done is almost six years ago. Their final scene together causes nausea ("You were a long, long way", etc.). The great British actor, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute portrait as Burton's friend and seems to be a little drunk and speaks his voice with a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgotten performance in the horror, terrible rehash of classic movie. Avoid at all costs.
