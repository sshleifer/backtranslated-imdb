I can not believe it's on DVD. Even less was available in my local video store. Some say it's a good movie if you consider it has only a budget of $ 4000. I think it's funny. I think it is very bad, depending on the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, I read in another review: "Drama aside, if you love horror and love something similar to Duel (1971) updated with a bit more story and some pretty girls that suit you, you will love this film. "What? It's a shame that compares these two films. <br /> <br /> I give "1" because I can not put "0". I just can not see any way this movie could be fun.
