Due to his pedigree, it should be a much more entertaining film than it is. Even with a shot of eccentricity in the cast - what would fanfare impatiently expect a movie that links Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is overcrowded, furious, and more often than dirty. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as confirmed by Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a great comic, as he did in the Philadelphia Story films and Harvey. I think he or she looks better than anyone else. Maybe a cat.
