you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually at the age of 55 on filming, but he looked like 70 years and only lived for 8 years. One Holden point said, "I'm over two." Okay, try a triple grandfather! The theme "old enough to be your father" that they shot did not work. They granted elderly people who have ever ended up with legal teens. More power to them, but that does not mean I want to look at it. It's not a question of judgment, but a digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and 70's cars, clothes, furniture, etc. It's worthwhile if they appear on the cable late at night and you want to watch something that might happen to get on the bed. It would be nice to see a blond friend of Lenz, whoever listened to the guitar and gained more scenes. Pretty happy ... Who was the cat? I'll try to find out.
