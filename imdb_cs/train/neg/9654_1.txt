The film is just bad. Just terrible. A bunch of bad Bollywood movies have no end! They have to be exhausting because they do such terrible movies (or not). The problem seems to be mainly with directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to bring great performance ... but they were so poorly managed. The bad scenario also did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of ridiculous moments and bad adjustments in the first half. For example, <br /> <br /> After the first big concert, Ajay Devgan will meet Om Puri (from whom he fled 30 years ago and spoke again) and all that Puri Puri finds is to be careful about his friendship with Salman !!! What a burden. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is a totally miscast for displaying a rockstar. <br /> <br /> In the second half, there are only good rescues. Ajay shines when his character shows his dark side. So does Salman as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Watch it maybe for the last half hour.
