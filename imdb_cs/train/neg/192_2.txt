The only good part of this film is beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should leave the pulpit at a time when his son Paul was out of the teachings he had proclaimed. How many times can his boys in vain highlight the name of the Lord in this film from the presbyterian environment? That is not adequate. I wanted Paul to be on the river without a ship at the very beginning to save us a stupid, stinky, selfish story about Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher, and Paul becomes the compulsive player Norm wants to save, but not so. It's very uninteresting. We see that Paul was standing in front of his native American girl. It was the only part that had some interest, and maybe she could develop into a real "wild west." What we see is a sleepy city where the sons of the two ministers have nothing to do with the norm. 1. Norms squeeze a girlfriend's slipper and deal with her family and 2.Paul makes stupid stories at a newspaper store while scratching his head and taking a lot of swings and tie a lot of flies. I'd rather watch the show about fishing that movie again - which will never be.
