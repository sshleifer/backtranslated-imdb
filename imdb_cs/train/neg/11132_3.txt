The documentary, like any filmmaker, must show a compelling story. Will Pascoe in this effort is utterly wrecked, along with Chomsky's wisdom from visiting McMaster University in Hamilton. Shot is filmed amateur and in video. Pascoe's only endeavor to bring the fragments together is to cast an unclear title on the screen regularly: "9-11", "Activism," "Truth." <br /> <br /> Compare with documents such as The Corporation or The Fog of War, which create narrative drawings from interviews, movies, and filmed footage. Finally, each brings a meaningful and intelligent, prompt and clear message. <br /> <br /> The only rescuing merits of the film are Chomsky's unacceptable additions to historical dogmas and the fact that the run time is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's story about his experiences with National Public Radio. He describes conservative media as more receptive to dissenting opinions, while NPR is the liberal dogma of the strait-jacket of his interviewed and dramatically restricts his holiday news. One more media matter is skeptical. This document is for Noam Chomsky completists only.
