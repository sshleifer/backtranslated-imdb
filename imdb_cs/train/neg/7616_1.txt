The good news is a film based on the presumed Aztec myth and poses an unusually aztec-American (such a word exists) cast. The bad news is that he was dead at birth. If Ed Wood fell out of retirement and trained George Romara through his classic "Night of the Living Dead," we could come with it. "Legend of Diablo" is clearly fed for any future resurrection of "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> I do not think he could even call it 'B'. The production figures are so profound that I still felt watching either a lengthy track from a diverse show or an eight-year-long movie in a backyard that fired a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> Some SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The line of the conspiracy sounds pretty interesting to attract me to rent. The California village sheriff finds a box containing the Aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on unsuspecting communities. His daughters, one hot and one cozy team with a gringo FBI man and priest, try to kneel the demon again. <br /> <br /> While any zombie scene ever seen in previous undead movies is re-enactted-wrong. These zombies go more like an army of walnut professors than undead! Expected infrared scenes from the view of the demon are nothing special? and he / she certainly seems to be backing a lot (unlike the forward motion). And the scene where the priest lures the demon from the cave in rapid motion is absurd! It really does seem to be done for a comic effect - though I know it was not! I still expected the music of Benny Hill to play and for the entire gang of zombies to start pursuing the priests across the beach! Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams calling the FBI agent is becoming comic. Then again, so most of this cheese was a ball! Robert Napton, director and writer of the script, should get something for this effort! (And how lifelong blackballing like "Hollywood 10?") This one I see now is rated 1.5 on a scale of 10. I'm afraid it might be a bit generous! <br /> <br /> Is this movie good? Well, Lindsey Lofas looks nice as the younger sheriff's younger daughter. This is probably the reason why her elderly sister (Calvi Pabon) actually escaped from home! Fred Estrado is fairly decent as an agent of the FBI. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto, who was trying for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should stay on baseball. In fact, they could not get worse if they went with a baseball theme and called her "Demons in Outfield!" If I find it a project for community classroom cinema, I will apologize. It could be good enough for B or even B + until the gang gets the college video camera back into the campus in one piece! The Blair Witch Project has proven that a cold, camping movie can be created on the shoe. The "Legend of Diablo", though, did not seem to have shoes from the shoes that could work! It was low-budget, low talent, little. The last final scene - and I think about the last ten seconds of the movie - is just a slightly creative or interesting moment. I paid $ 3.45 for rent. I could use it better for a hamburger!
