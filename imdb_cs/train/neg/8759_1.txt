Why? Why did they shoot this movie? If Timothy Olyphant had not been in a shirt several times, there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie at all. Um ... Plot? No way. Well-defined characters? no way. The only time I laughed was when my friend was enjoying the on-bang. P.S. Andy Dick? No way.
