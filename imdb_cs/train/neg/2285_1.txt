Well, that's 90 minutes of my life, I will not go back. This movie makes the teen tv show "California Dreams" look like "almost glorious". The game was terrible and the story was unrealistic. Do not even start my own band in the forefront of this story, lame songs, look, etc. You had to believe that they are one of the hottest bands in the country and there is not enough irony for the world to accept it. The guitarist is considered a heroin user, not that I blame him if I was around such a deep band with centuries-old songs and wooden actors, I would have injected horses. music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
