"Nineen Eighty-Four" is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very dark movie and it's not like you feel good about yourself. This is the romance that takes place in this society, and betrayal of lovers and human nature. The film has some very good ideas and is well realized in displaying this company with dark tones of color (contrasts with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and the general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the cleverness of the film when introducing this idea, the film was very slow, and it did not seem like the idea was quite enough. It seemed to spend too much time to be smarter than telling the story.
