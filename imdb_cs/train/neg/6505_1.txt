Confused mess from beginning to end. Like they said about the Beatles poles, it was a secret message if you played the LP back. If one had the patience to watch these movie scenes from start to finish, you would have gone with the same degree of disappointment. In addition to all these psychedelic fashion experiences from flashbacks and fake startups, the brightest characters were movie supporters who had their revenge if the movie was not released. She did not even like the two. Overtaking, shouting and threats were delivered in fashion comics. I think one dimension was overestimated. Well, maybe artistic types are turning their eyes when they realize that, unlike them, we plebeans, they just did not get it. Well, I'm afraid nothing will happen. And the two main sins of any bad movie are from the beginning to the end. A non-existent and sad narrative line, if you want to call it, and by far the worst, not the only character that you'll take care of.
