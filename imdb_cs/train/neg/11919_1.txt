it must be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. The first time I saw a trailer in 1991, it looked great. Since then, I've always wanted to see him, but I will never find her ... ... still today, yes, 14 years later. I just say I was so disappointed with his unreal, OK, I knew it would not be an Oscar winner, but he still hoped it would be fun-free movies in the bloodstream. Unfortunately it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> what's with all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Combat scenes were garbage and looked fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me only 5 pounds and I believe I was crowded by 7 pounds <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know half back.
