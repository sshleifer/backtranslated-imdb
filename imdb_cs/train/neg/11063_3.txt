I have the "courage" to inform you to stay away from "Dahmer," a biographical film based on the real story of a grotesque serial killer. "Dahmer" is more prominent in relation to the mentality of its targeted subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered more than 15 young men and ate some parts of the body, was probably the most incomprehensible serial killer of our generation. However, true sick people are the creators of this horrible spectacle who should investigate their heads before they decide to illuminate this terrible 'dahm' project. This is not an easy film that could be spent, even if Jeffrey could easily cure him with some fiery "brain" appetizers or even some real "Mr.". Potato peel '. * Error
