Frankly, who in the name of God gave this film 8.1 ratings? I think the people who actually performed or played in the film were those who voted. Otherwise this movie is upset! This film is nothing but an amateur or student film. I'm a film fanatic and I've seen horrible movies, but nothing has ever been redeemed. Story and acting was the worst I've ever seen. Supports, including the use of airsoft toy weapons with a terrible special effect, where it is just as bad as everything else. I'm a bad language in the movies, but the F-bomb has been dropped about every third word and I think we could have the winners to make the most of the F-bomb in every EVER movie. The film also looks like it was shot using cheap camcorders rather than a real movie. I would expect it to be awarded an amateur film award, which will only be shown on public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to the DVD. Do not buy the film. Do not write this movie. All I can say is that it is a terrible loss of a free movie rental coupon. It's a precious time to NEVER return. Unfortunately, time is lost to me, but it is not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning.
