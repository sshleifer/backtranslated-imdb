Uwe Boll has made it impossible: to create a game adaptation that remains at least a bit true for the game; he turned the game full of antisocial and offensive content into a film full of antisocial and insulting content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. Unfortunately, we still have Uwe Boll so do not expect the movie to be really good. while it has an instant, the "mail" takes its welcome very quickly and it becomes pain to sit down. <br /> <br /> In its core, Postal is a satire in the United States, like a twelve year old child made. It seems Boll thinks the attack is linearly proportional to comic value: the more insulting, the more fun and the more fun it is. The result is a movie that sets a new level of carefreeness while being extremely hit and lost. Yes, some gags work, but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director who satirized himself and the people who violently hit trucks and other vehicles. The low score is ... and much of everything else. <br /> <br /> After an initial surprise, the mail simply becomes a hole. Yes, it's good and good joke every ten minutes, but everything else consists of a horda of poisonous characters that shoot and chase everywhere around what seems to be eternity. worked as a short film but it's just not enough content for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (even though it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and a nice attempt but hopelessly losing in endless and useless action scenes and content that is offensive just because of it 4/10
