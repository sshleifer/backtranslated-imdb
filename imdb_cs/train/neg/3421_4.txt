STAR EVALUATION: ***** The work **** simply lacks the mark *** that a small bit between ** Staying behind * boreholes <br /> <br /> Some plutonium is gone and some very unpleasant people (Joshua McCord ) and his young protector Deke (Judson Mills, another actor from the previous movie) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) to stop them. It was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of September 11. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even remarked how the courageous story line to the movie resembled what happened in New York City that day, so there were those who would be in the mood for a movie where Norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass, if nothing else. Besides, it's as interchangeable as something Norris has ever gone through. He wonders what he had originally done to be a continuation and whether he could become a presidential man 3 sometime soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen one Norris movie, you've really seen them all and it's nothing new or unexpected about what happens to this, but at least you know what you got and like I said it could be just what some needed to let out some steam. **
