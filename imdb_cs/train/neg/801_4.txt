In spite of my stereotypes, practically "non-name" cast and apparently low budget, I thought this movie was fine; much better than I expected. At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus, which could also infect people, seemed a little absurd to me. But in the end, I thought the films worked the concept well (although some scenes were a bit of a cliché). The cast was quite good, and both films seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not help thinking that Janine Turner was a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or makeup, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but it just kept shaking the back of my mind all the time. Although it's not a 'must see' or a great movie of any standard, 'Fatal Error' is a fun movie that will keep you up to the end.
