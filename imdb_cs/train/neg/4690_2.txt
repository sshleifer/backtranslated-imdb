This British movie is really terrible, and it's hard to believe Glenn Ford is in it, though he's almost doing it. The idea of ​​a bomb on the train sounds good ... but it turned out that this train will end up parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area in which the train is parked is evacuated, so it is not as if someone is in danger. In fact, this movie could be used in the movie class to show you how to NEVER PREVENT film with tension. True tension is generated by letting the audience know what the characters do not have, the fact of the apparently unknown director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we are guided by the assumption that there is only one. Once the first bomb is devalued, it does seem to have no reason to watch the movie. But at the last moment, a villain who has no apparent motivation for his actions reveals that there are two. We are not even convinced WHEN the Bombs set off, so we do not even have a classic "ticking bomb" tension. You spend about 10 minutes or more looking at French wife Glenn Ford, who thinks of leaving him, and then he's wondering where he is. He's such an annoying figure that we do not care if he likes it, so if he does, it's nothing emotional about it. Most other characters are quite deprived of personality and none of them has any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it's long because it's tedious and boring. Do not waste time.
