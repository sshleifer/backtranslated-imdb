What a pity when the potentially captivating and refreshing low key story manages the lock on your interest at the beginning and then gradually let you down further and further until you leave scratched your thoughtful head at the time you reach your overwhelming conclusion. Unfortunately, it happened to me until the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> This was not Michael Keaton's mistake; it was a pleasure to see that he would return as a star of a brand new movie, and he might seem a little crumpled, but he still managed to give him a strong and honest performance. As a man whose wife recently died, he is obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea) that apparently comes into contact with her through the horrified electric socket you see on the television screen when he does not care. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> it's really so I'm not going to make any comments about what I mean, or they. Let me just say that I am all because I'm in such fantastic movies thinking about the suspension of distrust, but what I can not tolerate does not understand what the hell is going to be, which is where I was when the credits finally started to roll. It's really static. Occasionally there are movies that make me very confused, but if the film does not make it clear for me, I tend to regard it as a filmmaker's fault, not my own (if I did not see it when I was too tired to concentrate or something) . Well, for WHITE HONEY I was deep awake, bright eyes and mud-watching - so guess who's to blame?
