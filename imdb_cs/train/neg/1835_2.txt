Start with the script. I've seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy". Whenever characters repeat what you've seen before, and it was not fun for the first time, the movie is in deep trouble, which is "Envy" for sure. A film that relies on one joke should have somewhere better with it. Here's a movie that does not come back anywhere. Christopher Walken would like to forget about this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller was in a few good black comedies, "Flirting with Disaster" and "Duplex," immediately coming to mind. Make sure Envy is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves to be a low rating, because it's like an object, it sneaked. - MERK
