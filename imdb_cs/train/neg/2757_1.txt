I'm a guy who loves movies on a boy ... I'm looking forward to fighting the dragon with the army with cool special effects. It all happened, but this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The story was standard, but the story was terrible. The transition scene was the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go to the beach to relax if your life was in danger? Dragon Dragon's acts were very badly written ... and the attacking ability of Serpent's dragons differed greatly throughout the movie, the main characters would die a few times. The director tried to put a love affair in the middle of the movie in the most stressful time, this film apparently was not tracked after it was made, I love movies, but I had to get to finish watching, thank God I did not buy it, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy it, do not lend it, just watch the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
