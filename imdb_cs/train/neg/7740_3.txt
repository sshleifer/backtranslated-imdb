This movie really does a nonsensical enjoyment for a 2/3 journey. The film is sad to be too "confused". While I know that some of the scenarios are the standard of "Buddy Cop", I got into a figure that is brilliantly blueprinting for each other, but ultimately, the film relies too much on watching the pursuit like a crutch and losing interest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We created our own opinion rather than being vigorously fed by looking at them through constant harassment. Eventually, it's going too much and it greatly aggravates what could have been a pleasant escape. Here's what Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) is about at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate deals 2. His affair with radio psychic 3. Is investigated by internal affairs 4. Murder murder <br /> <br /> If you add to Casey's fear of falling in love, he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. Now some of these things will come together and even get together well, but all conspiratorial elements are gathering in the middle of this fake hunt that is so long and pathetic that I do not have time to break my ennui and crap about what has just happened . Impressive screenwriting acrobatics can not overcome bad filming. <br /> <br /> As if the ridiculous sequence of persecution was not bad enough, the one that has four separate parts and could take almost half an hour was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan Field calls for his deal deal while chasing the gun offender. All these out-of-school lines and jokes make for me totally insignificant whether the crime is caught or not. We have forgotten, or we are no longer interested in the murderous plot, because a few conspiratorial lines and eye-catching persecutions have poisoned us over all understanding. While I could continue to persecute and destroy a decent story, I will not. This could be a very nice movie pattern, but it was too big for its pieces and it has changed into a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett really did a good job and the little appearance of Gladys Knight is worth mentioning. Unfortunately, none of the actors can forget about this hopelessly misplaced film. While it's probably better than "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II," they're not going to make the movie good. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to be doing only movies he thinks he's making money. I'm not sure whether this is true or not. What is true is that you do not need a great movie or a great actor to get a great treasury, this film does not even have its major roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be to stick with Indians Jones, because at least you can still run.
