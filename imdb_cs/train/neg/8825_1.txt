The only reason I'm going to make this movie a single star is how much the laugh ended. I had a lot of hope because I usually love bad holiday horror films, but it just did not. It's really just a bad attempt to make the figure appear in madness, which again is not a bad plot, but it's wrong here. There are some scenes (for example, the end) that are not thoughtful, but in fact it laughed out loud. It was several times when I thought the film would really go interesting but never do what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for Christmas slasher, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
