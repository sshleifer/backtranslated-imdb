I did not think it would be possible for the comedy horror movie to fail together on both fronts ... really horrible. The fact that they do not care seriously (usually a good thing) is because the actors are so wooden that you really swear they are reading the cards. At the end when ..... the version of MST3K, as always, has a few laughs ....
