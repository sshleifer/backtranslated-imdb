It seems that Claire Denis's films fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or silent and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as bad as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". From the moment I saw "Chocolat" I did it to see every new movie Denis. And I've always been disappointed. L'Intrus was no exception. He has to make the film as personal and moving first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis' regular: Elder, but still spectacular Béatrice Dalle, who seems to be in the movie just to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her big split and a few nice coats; black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin and Lithuanian or Russian girls. The figure of Michel Suborro was so interesting, but the camera floated for so long because I was upset that I leaned my hair over his forehead and relieved him when he finally cut me somewhere in Korea. <br /> <br /> It was definitely an action-a terrible murder, a human being looking for a son-and perhaps even a conspiracy, but one glance was not enough for it to come, and two views are, I'm afraid, of a question. First, the score was annoying and annoying (as in "Beau Travail"). In the morning they changed too unexpectedly, so you were even more confused about what was going on. Oh, there were a couple of nice shots, and if you liked "Friday night" with your shots on the folds in heavy dredges and beds, you can appreciate the aesthetics "L'Intrus". Otherwise, discard it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I miss something essential. But the dialogue in Denis rarely makes more than five pages, doubled, and with sufficient margins. In "Chocolat" silence is noble; in "L'Intrus", it's just boring.
