For life, I can not understand good reviews for this kec. It was useless. Matthew Modine was terribly dirty as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon, they said, but I repeat why a stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was bad. I do not know if it was an accent or something. There was no chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> And Modine's girl was in love, she suddenly pushed a half saliva in her mouth and acted like a jerk? Where does it come from? I think we should like it because we saw her marriage with a worker start falling apart, but frankly, I can not enjoy some of those people.
