REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see how reviews live here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's one big pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would laugh aloud and a lot, but he was on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my next answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think I liked the date, "nice old boy" in the plain. This is not a compliment. I know the actor wants to work ... Excellent for the rest. But Ralph, come on. It was a painful irritation from Ralph. I voted 2 just because Ralph looked like, but I have to ask, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I am going to watch the end of the affair to recover and recover ... C1
