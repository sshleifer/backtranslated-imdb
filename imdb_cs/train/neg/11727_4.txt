I would not say it horribly, but it does not interest anything in this movie and it is burdened with some really incredible development of the basic fences. It starts well, but once the main hit is done, it moves into a long subplot around a young girl that is not boring, and some scenes that are the theater of absurd unrealism. For example, there is a prolonged shootout at an airport where stroboscopic lighting is. No explanation. How trusted is that the airport storage space will have lights that could blink and blur and only allow Snipes to make his incredible schtick escape? This is one of the too few action scenes that have been overwhelmed by unnecessarily drawn assemblies that simply can not draw into a pause of faith. In addition, the whole idea seems to be that the CIA United States team can shoot a seat, but you run away by saying "national security" to the British. This trick is based on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies. Better formulation, better execution. This time, it's fun sometimes, but there's only scarce meat on the bones, and after a while it's getting really boring - something that should never be done in a good action movie.
