Somebody will have to explain why every film that contains poor people and accepts a pseudo-grainy look is somehow considered "realistic" by some people. I did not see anything realistic about the characters (though the actors did the best with the really bad parts) or the situation. Instead, I saw a forced, self-confident effort to be "nervous", "drunk" and "dirty." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than holding a camera without hand or reason, and it does not shine the film to achieve some of the above features in some significant way. It's a sad commentary on the state of independent film division that the only movies he sees inside the movie theater are at present all carbon copies, bad cinematography, a non-existent camera direction, and a lot of talents that try to go through "art." No wonder films such as "In The Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" are getting such raves. I have found that they are meandering and very average, but in comparison to the current number of independent clones, such as "Raising victor Vargas", they are brilliant and inspired. A few years ago, watching an "independent" movie meant that you would have liked to have some originality and amount of energy and care and perhaps a few technical problems caused by low budgets, nowadays it means you have a chance to get even more numbers - try-a camera-around-two-hour attempt to placating the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course everything that serves characters and situations that are completely unrealistic and conceived. Is it surprising that an independent market has fewer companies that have survived? Not at all, when you see movies such as Raising Victor Vargas, which will do nothing but copy the worst movies that preceded them.
