I've read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and it's definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, in that her costumes and locations reflect real gang photos. Especially well done is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photo taken on that day when Blanche mourns her dying husband. Nevertheless, this film is still Hollywood and our anti-heroes remain up to the end even after they were shot with full holes (in Bonnie's life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident a year before her famous passenger and did not look disturbed by the cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is boring and acting is bad, especially the lead. Great disappointment. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be the "true story", but it's a great movie.
