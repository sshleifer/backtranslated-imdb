Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings had a profound effect on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly expected that this film would look and learn more about his life. Words barely express their disappointment. This film was incoherent ... he did not provide any information about his life, the historical context, and nothing about his big writings (except for a brief reference to "Learning Costs" by a colleague at the beginning of the film.) Instead, we see him enjoying jazz in the States) and cool down with their friends before deciding to return to Germany. He obviously showed his human face. OK, I'm ready for a dramatic part. A part where it is worth your faith. Instead of emphasizing, we get very bad romance with a 17-year-old school girl. Whatever really happened, it should not be the main part of the movie. Now ... he's still waiting for a dramatic part or a narrative that explains what his writings are ... or something to get to know a little of this man's magnificence. drummer ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is a movie that gives the "Christian movies" a bad name. All they had to do was build up the structure of the movie that would follow, with some backgrounds ... even with some voices and back searching for his sermon from his songs ... some story about who he is and where he was. But no ... that's what we got. It is hardly fit for the hero of faith.
