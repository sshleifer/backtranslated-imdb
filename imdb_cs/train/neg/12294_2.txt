I saw this movie purely for setup. He was filmed in an old hotel where his friend had shares. The plot was predictable, the acting was the mediorcre at best, the fears were all gross-out, not real fears. I do not remember the conspiracy and I think it's because of not much to remember. They did not even use the hotel to have full potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is on the peninsula. At tide, you can walk into the bay almost 1/4 mile, which is actually a scary sight of the first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind cracks through the cracks. The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can quickly go through the events (and I use this term freely) scenes and a break at the beauty of the neighborhood!
