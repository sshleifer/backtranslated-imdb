Most of the scenes should be interrupted. There are many scenes that should be cut off. For example, a scene where thinkers mention "I have spiders on my dick", "I like dick", playing in a muddy scene or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunts the main job is a snarm snake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While they love themselves, they did not know they were doing it with a little boy who would soon run away and lose his head? Why do they do it in the living room? I mean, the head really turned his head. And what the beach scene reminds of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene at Grant Lake. All this strange scene could easily be nicknamed and accounted as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here, in my local Cinemaplex theater, I advertised the months around Dinocrocus and I'm glad I did not watch because I later found out that it was displayed only 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The film was so bad. I supposed Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. He is equipped with a Dinocroc leg, which looks like a baby with a green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like 2 years old. It could easily go like Baby Geniuses. If some film-making students want to know what to do, it's real classic waste. Such as Dianin's friend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what a poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk before he gets into the beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The man pants looked much more interesting than the entire Dinocroc movie. His acting was so bad he was doing much better for Mr Bean. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with better comedy talent in science fiction horror. Maybe a worse casting in Hollywood history.
