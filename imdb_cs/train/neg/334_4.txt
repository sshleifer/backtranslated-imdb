The bad movie is sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with lots of bad special effects, lots of stupid scenes (like airports) and a real unfortunate time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as evil and is much better at (The Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) doing non-comic jokes, and I've heard that it has sank already succeeded, a great time success ??? !! I never understand why or how? In one television interview I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, it's comically sorry! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, no friend of mine. It's a film folly that has been creating a number of RAZZIE movies for years, whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons to write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget the long, tanned, fascinating legs (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she was in bed before the bad guys attacked their house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, the camera with her naked legs should be. But how odd! How did I watch her in the following films and she was not so beautiful again? Anyway, the second reason is that I recently found the title of this film on my list of the worst 100 films ever! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad film, Greeeeeat legs.
