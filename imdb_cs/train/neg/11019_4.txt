Fred Olen Ray is a miserable director, even when it comes to film directors B, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his better films. Yes, it erases the great Poe story "Premature Funeral" and yes, it's bad and uneven, but it's also fun. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife, whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is about to leave because she needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many fine-core films from the early 1990s, actually gives the best film as a dear mistress. You will also have small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a Doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice portrait in one of the better scenes. The end did not make much sense!
