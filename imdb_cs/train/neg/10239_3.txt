Jude Law puts it all in this beautifully rendered vampire movie that offers something else. Completely missing erotic, excitement or front ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of moderate tension. And a movie with one note. The film was filosofically sung in a series of interviews between the law and the uprooted murder detective, played well by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are pulled to cross the banality of the film. With smaller actors in the lead - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography - crocodiles would be the sea of ​​low-budget quickies vampires.
