We've all seen endless epics in our days, but that's really all! The film is so long and slow that just looking things in perspective I felt much older when I left the movie hall before I joined it. For almost 4 hours, it could have been made as a telescope. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace. Nikhil Advani has lost conspiracy around 6 love stories and can not bring justice to either of them ... There is no link between them and links to the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to connect the story. <br /> <br /> The situation is aggravated by silly dialogues (most of which are repeated in the Hindu cinema for years) and silly cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize she actually needs her to play a role rather than just looking for a glam on the screen ... A complete loss of beauty without acting skills. And then there is a loud-humorous Govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-them -karrey Akshay Khanna, who burns at the top of her lungs to irritate already tired viewers. <br /> <br /> Just a good part of the film is John & Vidya love story and a nice acting / comedy from sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that just these two couples could justify the film without being absorbed by another lot of characters. Their brilliance is lost in the middle of the other inferior lines. <br /> <br /> My guess - the director makes two separate movies (it can be more!) And some beginner helper has mixed all the records, beyond the boundaries the director left without the possibility to show it as the only film ... <br / > <br /> Watch it only if you want to test your patience !!!
