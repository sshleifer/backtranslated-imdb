Words can not describe how this movie is bad. I can not explain it just by writing. You see it too well to get to see how it can really be a terrible movie. Not that I recommend that you do it. There are so many clich√©s, bugs (and all the other negative things you can imagine) that will just cry you. Getting started with the technical first, there are many bugs about the aircraft. I will not introduce them here, but just mention the color of the plane. They even failed to show the aircraft in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used 747 painted in Boeing's original painting. Very bad. The conspiracy is stupid, and it has been done many times, much more, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments that I missed counting it really soon. I was also in the movie all the time because good guys were so stupid. An "executive decision" would undoubtedly be above this choice, even those "Turbulence" are better. In fact, every other film in the world is better than this one.
