There is so little fantastic book, Anne Rice, that what is here is meaningless. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not do it on the screen at all, and those who do it are embalmed to the point of no reason for their existence. the relationship between Christopher and Marcel? Where is the ongoing relationship between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose ever appear because her story never said? Where is the rape and redemption of Mary, whose biggest attribute (and fall) is that she can pass white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel's bit in the hands of his father? We never learn about Aglae that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why no story explaining this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for the performance, there is none that is better than the average, although it is probably caused by a dirty screenplay. Best of all, the actor plays Richard, but Richard is not on the screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though she is again an actress who has nothing to do with what she has little work to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's terrible. I thought it would not be possible for Anne Rice's film-turned-book to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST ALL SAINTS causes the confusion to be a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a bitch that she lets her best work become such a jump on the screen?
