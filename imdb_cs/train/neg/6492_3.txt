I was not quite sure what to expect from the genre of Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, but with the actors involved, I thought I would turn it. The tone of the film was embarrassing, it passed through the stories of the genres but never felt balanced, so I finally stopped trying to concentrate on cinematography and the individual performances that I thought were good overall, had little depth due to the nature of the story (you can not do anything). I have to say she felt much longer than 96 minutes running and not good. In the end, I was looking for a closure, a certain degree of satisfaction, but it was not a smart or brilliant work that I hoped it would be. I think Tony was mistaken in thinking that what he did at the end of the film gave us ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to confirm the 95 minutes before the wrong conclusion. Finally, I feel cheated. IMO would be better to let it stand without "end" as a piece of art ... just. Or maybe ... I just missed this point :)
