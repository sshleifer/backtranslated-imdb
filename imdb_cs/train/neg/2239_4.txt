This spike has already been described by other reviewers, so I simply add that the reason I wanted to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in her undisputed glory. Miss Drake must be one of the prettiest, most beautiful examples of "posh tota" that have committed themselves to celluloid. From her time and fury, Jane Asher is just as brilliant. What was with the actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who love me, they admire Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not disappoint. He has a beautiful figure and nothing left to be imagined. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very poor and is very cheap at its time. The song that covers the initial credits seems to last forever and is scary.
