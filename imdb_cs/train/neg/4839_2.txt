... And let yourself get bigger than ever. I will not make any direct reference or anything, but at least this film is pathetic. If you're a military coach, do not worry. I put it on DVD with 2 friends who wanted to watch a somewhat interesting event / war. Why did I read my review first? <br /> <br /> Already on the first scene of "bombs" the film has huge glitches and is still showing up and becoming bigger and bigger. My two friends, who are not connected with the army, have seen a few mistakes of filmmakers almost as fast as myself and asked me if some things are happening, we are realistic. Well, as you thought, they are not - at all. Avoid this movie if you can not overlook these completely idiotic and repetitive errors. 2/10 for my interest.
