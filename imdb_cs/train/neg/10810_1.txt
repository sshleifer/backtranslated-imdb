There is one thing I have to say about this movie - the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra's legend of being a demon; You never see this movie. The story is awful, acting is horrible (hi, that's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (just as bad) twice before seeing this movie.
