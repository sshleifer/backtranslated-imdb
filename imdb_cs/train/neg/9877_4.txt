Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson directs and respects a short book of the same name on the big screen in a feature film. While I realize what Anderson, an incredibly talented person, seemed to have lost in his clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing he was a talented person, and if it were a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like going to school and having your first bad day, it's the first bad day for Anderson to shoot a movie, so I'll leave it easier. I admit that it has a smart and nice ghost and the animation is nice, but the movie is getting harder to get inside, let the story behind, and random shots of random things happen. Characters are good as well. Jason Schwartzman reveals the intelligent son of Mrs. Fox (George Clooney), Ash and especially the pilgrim. The film does not really get worse, but it's coming. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on the road with another amazing movie when and where he's going to make another movie, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a big disappointment.
