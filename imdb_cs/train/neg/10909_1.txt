This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and give them angry! There's maybe a funny joke, it's stupid and boring. During the short film I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. Nobody makes a man, and everyone behaves stupidly and ridiculously. Rob Schneider, who acted as an animal, is not something I want to see. It looked funny, but the bottom line: DO NOT PROMPT THAT THE TIME IS GOOD IN THIS LOCAL AND LOCK FILM. I wondered when it would end, even though it was a short film. At first we thought it would be better; but it worsens. Foolish, to the end. I went out of the theater and I remember that the movie is extremely bad forever. Writer and co-producer of this movie is Simpsons TV Writer, but it's nothing like The Simpsons movie is upset !!!)
