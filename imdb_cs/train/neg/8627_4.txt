Though it's a rough rough jungle-adventure movie, it has some warning - the setting is quite beautiful, and the transition from the adventure is good. You will not get bored watching it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as breezy as possible playing on eponymous leadership, unabashedly drunk jungle guide by shanghai'd accompanied by wealthy boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife Sprinkler on a hunt expedition in the cannibal country. She never thinks seriously. The shower is there as a decoration, and Keith uses it very much - it really does not have to work much. She is not the only woman to show her her body, and the prurient aspects of the movie make it halfway to the T / A image. There is nothing in this movie that would attract special attention or from it. Made as a shlock, it succeeds without too much excitement. Good programmer for 2 AM cables.
