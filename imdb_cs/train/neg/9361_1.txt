When I saw a preview on TV, I thought, "It's going to be a good werewolf movie," but it was not. it was not scary at all! the deal was good, the conspiracy was awful, the military offer was simply stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could do better than this cage. The movie made it sound like Arron to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned into a psycho and a little doctor's throat. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies, there are all positive, but this is not just because the story was terrible. One of the 10 max I'm sure you expected a werewolf, but I bet you did not expect it. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie, heck, every movie on the science fiction channel is better than this movie.
