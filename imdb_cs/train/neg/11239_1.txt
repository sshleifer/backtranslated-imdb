Do not forget the notes behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments on this movie must receive royalties. This is a terrible movie in every direction. Imagine children in high school without the money and no sense of humor that make video slash / comedy. They will get it for D. The college children would get F or have asked to leave the school. Since this mockery has been made "experts," I believe there should be a prison time or at least a screening of cinematography. I like watching bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space," but this thing does not even fall into this category. Scenario, acting, sound, and direction are so bad that they are practically indivisible. If you like watching bad movies that are a funny stick with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970 horror films. After looking at it, you feel like you've lost an hour and a half of your life.
