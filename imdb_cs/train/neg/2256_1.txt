I admit I saw maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer." I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm over watching what's on his performance. You should try to rise above this. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social study I led. I was told that this film had little to do with Springer himself, rather he focused on the life of those who appeared on the "Springer". With a better approach, this film could really have a fascinating insight into how these people really are pathetic. I admit, I felt Connie (Molly Hagan) concentrate on empathy. That's all he has in life. How sad he feels he must go to the Jerry Show to resolve it. I really like Molly Hagan, who appeared in this. Have you noticed that after this film was mostly included in the role of "B" on TV? I'll tell you about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and tries to play her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not have his own scene. It just does not have what it takes to take the lead role. Her best work is Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but her heart was in the right place) and when she dedicated herself to "Seinfeld" as Sister Robert.
