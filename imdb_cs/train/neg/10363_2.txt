I grew up when I shed through the stories of the chronicle of wrinkles. My dream was that one day the screenwriter would hit her child sitting in a big sofa, read A Winkle in Time, and wonder what a wonderful movie he would have done. It is sad that the screenwriter failed, changed the characters, slammed into the lame of humor and destroyed everything. I know it's hard to change the movie into a movie. But why can not you remain faithful to this book? Why do you have to change the way of thinking and acting? For those of you who did not read the book, lift it up, find a soft sofa and leave your imagination wild.
