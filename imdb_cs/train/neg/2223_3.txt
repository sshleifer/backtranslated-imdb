Trite, clichÃ© and plotting (the same sort of thing we saw with all fantasy movies from the eighties), hokey music and character-based characters knock it out for all fans except the most powerful. > <br /> What saves this movie from the junk pile is the beautiful crke Bakshi's work, rotoscopy and the fact that Frank Frazetta has taught animators how to draw like him. This is Frazet ... on the move. Violence is spectacular, and artistic trends and animations are unlike other swords and wizards of the film period. I like to look at it with the sound and play the soundtrack to the first movie Conan instead.
