Very bad acting and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-movie <br /> <br /> Events that were considered as shocking as aboard a foreign ship were boring and very chaotic. This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and decided to watch her because I like the genre, but it was so bad. Now there are really few good movies on Alien, I think because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
