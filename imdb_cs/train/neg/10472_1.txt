I should have known I had problems with Casper Van Diem as a leading figure. Words can not describe or even decide how horrible this movie is. But let me try to describe it: Terrible acting, terrible dialogues, situations in horror, and that makes you feel like you are the power of feeding the Trinity Broadcasting Network and the propegances. It's a weak attempt to show Hollywood that the movie can be fun and has a deep, religious message. They failed unsuccessfully. It was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen.
