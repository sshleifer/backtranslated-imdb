A film about a small town with the same number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves, playing a rewritten dialogue, average performance, a green salad with a carrot jello and every other "inner Mormon joke" known to men. Anyone outside of the Mormon culture will have this film a difficult break. Everyone inside the Mormon culture will be a little amused and appealing to and fro. You'll be much better watching Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) Before trying to sit through this movie. The game is average. Jared Hess has his hands on much better movies such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both movies over this groaner.
