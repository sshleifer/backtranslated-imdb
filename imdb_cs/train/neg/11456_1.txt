This is one of those films that you think: would Hulk "real American" Hogan do the same? I honestly do not think so and he was right. I am Italian, I can not boast of my country for many reasons, but I would not play another team (for example, the French), simply because I am in love with Juliette Binoche. Besides the protagonist, she does not like the desire with a British girl at the end of the film, but with her colleague lace, so why rowing against Yale. As for acting, all the players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of "dead poets". Actually it's another movie I hate.
