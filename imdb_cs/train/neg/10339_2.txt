How does Mike Hammer live - in a shelter with GOLF BAG hidden in the corner next to a big-screen cathode-ray screen and a snappy fireplace? No, he betrayed a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of the fowl office or in the smell of a dirty LA house on the flop, wiped a dried red crust and warmed olive oil out of his face like this. Spillane wrote, of course, a basket, but how are you doing worse? Give some desperate producer control of empty control because he thinks that a movie called "Noir" will be sold out at the box office, sold in the box office, adding some hot tomatoes over the mountains, and just simply shutting down the story for a retarder, so it!
