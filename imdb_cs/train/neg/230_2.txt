That was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So the wooden makes the rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that you are in four weddings, as well as the poor. Another movie that shows England as full chocolate boxes and village greens. Do I mean the school, how many schools besides Hogwarts looks like this? The Twee Police Station looked like a Heartbeat set (a painful British series from the 1960s). This film simply could not disprove what it wanted to be - a comedy or serious investigation into the attic of female friends. If it was stuck on the former, then funeral sex scenes and very silly storms at the wedding could only work (I say only). But those scenes simply did not work with the tragedy in the second half. It also seems unlikely that Kate would talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. Final note - What is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the wrinkle.
