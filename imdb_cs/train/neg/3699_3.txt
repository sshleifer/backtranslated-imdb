<br /> <br /> One would expect a movie with a famous comic in the lead role, being a funny movie. It is not here. Once upon a time I laughed aloud and it was not even during the last comedy scene (which would also be expected to be the most amusing). This is the one you can watch when it comes to TV, do not let it rent any other money.
