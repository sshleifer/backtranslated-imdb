This movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. Some scary moments, but not enough to ever want me to see this movie again. There are some scenes that you can quickly move forward and nothing will miss you. The biggest defect is that it is so predictable, and that's why I rated it so low. It's observable, but do not expect anything great.
