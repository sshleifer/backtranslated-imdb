Trinity Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys looking for the Ginger Rogers hand, a working gal that sells taffy salty water. With the outbreak of the First World War, the trio enrolled and tried Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe's production is tough, with three men heading into a scenery with bloated disposable lines and a "catchy" dialogue that is quickly exhausted. The second half focuses on action sequences, as the US Navy tracks both the German merchant cruiser and the U-boat. These sequences are lively and well-shot, but overall they are an excessive and unsatisfactory comedy path with a flat end. Just for star fans.
