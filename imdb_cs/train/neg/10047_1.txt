Now I have written reviews for several episodes of the MZ and it is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned at the point when the loans roll. If you look at people who never really enjoy you in real life ("look at the basement!") Then it's your show. Besides, it's not fun or fun - it's just unpleasant. The scope of the virus has never been shown. I can very much ignore the fact that it is only for men, because the resulting situation is very, very scary. But then things get worse because the daughter will let the troubled father go home and finally die in her hands. The woman falls north and runs into dozens of situations. Then a ghost or stranger appears or something that saves her (things that make you go?). Or something. Then he hids behind the heat. End. <br /> <br /> Amazing. These directors send this trick.
