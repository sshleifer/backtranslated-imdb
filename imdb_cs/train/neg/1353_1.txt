What is it? is a mish-mash of bizarre repetitive motifs (snails, Shirley's temple, swastika and apparently racist music, among others) without any kind of narrative or conspiracy or character development. The whole thing has hit me like a confidently "frantic show" and I do not just think of the unusual casting decision. He has a sense of bad acidic path, far beyond any level of drug use that one might have attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only film I can compare is Eraserhead (my second least favorite film of all time), which was deliberately much more depressing, but I still found What is it? total waste of time. It is one thing that allows me to look into the inner functioning of someone else's mind-even to something else chemically altered consciousness-but to another that simply guesses strange visual traits purely for curiosity.
