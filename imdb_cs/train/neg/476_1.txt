When you convert a book to a movie, it's generally a good idea to keep at least some of the authors of the intended tone or conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access to Elinore Stewart's children's councils and continued their councils, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar in terms of good, enriching and empowering experience with the establishment of her country. The book details her life on her and her husband's neighbor husband in the enormous Wyoming border; she chronicles the daily adventure with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived tens of miles apart. The film, however, insists on a standard attitude when it happened, depicting the experience of this woman as harsh, indomitable and almost useless. Perhaps the director brought some of his Vietnamese war experiences to this film (as some film fans have said), but it seems to be a miserable excuse that she has taken all the joy and beauty of the book and rewound it into a bleak, foul landscape without friends or hope. Do not waste your time with this movie; read the book.
