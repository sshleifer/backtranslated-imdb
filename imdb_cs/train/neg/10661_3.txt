It's "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley, with all-star guest cast! The movie starts with a random (comfortable?) Kidnapping that leads to one thing and another - which in fact does not show the main story that is "Big House, USA". story of jail. The story is very unlikely. It's like a television show, just more "violent" (for times). But - cast is a trip! Explain: Ralph Meeker is sent to jail; his fellow citizens are: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (Muscle magazine) and William Talman (reading "Detective"!). Honest! You should know that the early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy and responds to the end of the "voice." If you do not want to have it hanging, do not miss the introductory scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian does well as a fugitive asthmatic). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
