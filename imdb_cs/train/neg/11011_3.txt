A series of painfully dysfunctional skits that seem to be forever and daily. It's not as terrible as saying "Freddy's Fingers" or "Lost Reality," but that is by no means a confirmation in any way, sense or form. It represents the worst rhyming clown ever. Most will be, if not offensive to anyone, but most violent or politically correct. It also has the worst song EVER parody on the film, the worst Arnold EVER impersonation (not only the worst of the film, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash (the reasons I first watched it) should play in this. The only thing that was slightly fun was Dickman. In conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone, but the people who are doing it on a mission in life to get it at bottom 250 at this place are pathetic. Do something remarkable with your living people. Moreover, if it is true, the Church Scientologists hate him, he can not be right. <br /> <br /> My level: D
