As I understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. I have doubts about whether it's the work of a normal person who loves movies, or it's the work of a movie student, because in the final credit is a link to the Arts School of Oporto. <br /> <br /> However, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this film the complete ignorance of some basic concepts of cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter for journalists. One of the first things you learn at school when studying a cinema is to tell the story. You will learn that, as in novels in movies, you should also build your story in three acts: introduction, development and conclusion. You will learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that it should be a climax. You will learn that this applies to a 3-hour epic, regular film, short film, and even, believe it or not, for a 30-second ad. You will also learn that in your approach to the academic structure there may be levels of softness and that ultimately you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> TIMUM WATCHER introduces us roughly to his main character and then the film ends - the whole movie sounds like a performance of characters in Jeunet AMELIA. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. It's not a parody or artistic movie, so you can not even try to justify disrespect for the academic structure. You expect a narrative to tell you, and it will not happen. The worst thing is that TIM WATCHER is defined as a warning; and one without a real purpose. This does not mean, or at least invalid. His point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The situations that are displayed are quite simple and their approach is Manichaean. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this much more. The film opens up with a good looking credit line and you quickly realize that you're watching something with better production value than the traditional Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this film, but in summary I think that I thank you for the concert, but merit must go to a productive team for such good connections in a country where it is difficult to open doors to young artists. > <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in a stylish, colorful and carefully chosen plan, combined with a fine score. That is all. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And that's a shame because it feels like a loss of production values. You can hardly see such a diversity of places in normal Portuguese and so many add-ons that enrich the story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison can look like, I have to put BMW short pendant as a good example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film that is strictly conditioned by product placement and above-standard style cinematography.
