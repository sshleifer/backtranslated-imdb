It seems the intention of the film was to show the aggressive character of the Mafia of the Russians, or at least those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so ineffective that they can not find a person who removes the bank even though these items leave the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and alleged Russian colleagues spoke in a language that was not identified anywhere, probably spoken by foreigners in the Ural Mountains, but it is far away Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep your busy teaching of Russian language grammar and pronunciation.
