It was a disappointing film. It seems that people have no substance, leading protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values, in fact, all of them including Jon Voight embody the slege. I would not want to make this film to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, albeit artificially created. Shooting is black, at least the ones I've seen in this category. Disappointment.
