Wow, a film about NYC politics, seemingly written by someone who never stood up in NYC. You know there's a problem when you expect the credits to come back and the movie will continue for another half hour. Characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the plotline shakes between boring and ridiculous. A horrible film.
