During the holidays on the beach they find seal robe-brothers brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (like Arthur and Petey Loomis). The boys baptize their work "Sammy" and spend the summer moon, which is bothering with the sand lion. When it's time to go home, the boys begin to suffer from separation anxiety. Young Mr. McGreevey decided he could not take "Sammy" back to "Disneyland"? er, "Gatesville" - but young Mr. Mummy will wrap him up. At home they try to hide the "cruise" from adults and of course? abductions to follow! <br /> <br /> Sammy - The Way-Out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
