This film is about a very young Cassie girl (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and becomes the first undergraduate. Once Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinks and dances, and Cassie goes with her boyfriend who loves but never tells him he loves him. As Cassie drove, the car was stopped in the middle of the road and she could not avoid an accident, resulting in a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie is very emotionally upset and has nightmares that cause her to hallucinate when her boyfriend returns to life and meets the men who try to kill her and she tries to find out who her real friends are, wants her dead and survives all the horrible suffering. Cassie dreams that her boyfriend loves her after he has died and finds another boy in bed and tells him to ask him to love. It's a movie that is not good at all.
