The case is the best part of the film, but it is not worth it at its cost. I was expecting a movie "Based on a real story" just to find a shot of home video that is badly cut, coupled with pathetic acting and unrelated scenes. Motion pictures had many rewinding situations that were probably used to extend the length of the traits rather than the effects. I started this review before I was even in the middle of the movie and waited for it to end only if it had a better end but a low one, and it just got worse. If I could call it lower, it would be ten negative. Learn from my mistakes and save money and time with this.
