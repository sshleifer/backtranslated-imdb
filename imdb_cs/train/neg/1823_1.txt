Characters Jack Black, Tim Dingman, Envy's "Dreamer," finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize," which when sprayed on a dog's dung will cause it to disappear into the air. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I was hoping that Vapoorize is a real product, so I could spray on this film's "stench" and disappear into thin air. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (this honor is a cat in a hat), she is honored for the other. <br /> <br /> It is not funny, not sad, not nothing. And the real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10!
