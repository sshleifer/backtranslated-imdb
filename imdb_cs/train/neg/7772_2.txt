This is a low movie. He has no real plot. We have never paid attention to motivation other than wealth. Characters are some of the worst actors ever to appear on the film. The threat appears to be supernatural, but then dominated by the three elderly people. Why they do what they do; to fear the other members of the group? I do not know. There is some fog from the fog that moves in the halls and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Does he do something? I do not know. There is some nudity with her own eyes. It always surprises me to see it in old movies. In fact, things have now satisfied themselves. All people run like chickens, ready for an ax. They have no plan; no resources; No nothing. There are about five silly climaxes in the movie. Who are these people and there is a ghost or a demon. What happened to other people? I urge someone to tell me for sure. Such a mess.
