The Story of Cinderella for Adults Living in a Dream. Romance is very unrealistic, embarrassing, loving, perfect, etc. Cinderella to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you are looking for a dreamy romance, it is definitely a movie, but for other real-world people I would highly recommend that you store your three-hour clock. Awake people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the film with me would not recommend the movie. We had a great time to knock most of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I just can not believe that such a movie can beat the classics like HDDCS !!
