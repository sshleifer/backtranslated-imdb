This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot, though shots, "special effects", acting and I mentioned a plot? Every thing in her was bumping her ass! This is a good example of what it means "over-doing" and trying to explain: I understand what the creator of this film was trying to do; this should be one of those movies that you really will not tell what the hell is going on until the end. You are sitting fascinating, you do not know who is dead and who is alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you have a timeline right, you find yourself wrong and the movie ends - and leave you open for another 5 minutes! Something like "unbreakable" or "work" if you know what I mean. But Olga Levens, the writer of this waste, yes, Olga? Writer, director, producer, scriptwriter, Caster, producer, artistic director, costume designer, and couple for one character are some scenes ... this is basically one female film and when it comes to Olga Levens of "Levens Productions" <br /> <br /> But that's how it looks like a shocker, but "this time" Olga survived this great time, jumping from scene to scene, dreams to reality ... but wait! this was after all a dream ... or was it ?? The picture disappears, and I realized that nothing like that happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... it was not a ship ... do not wait! There's a boat and boys again! They are alive! Thank God! No, they call her to join the voyage ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they're dead all the time ??? or maybe they were never alive when they started to understand what I just said you might like this movie - otherwise it's a tedious piece of work and the only reason is to find out how hell he can finish this movie .. Do not look at it if you are weighing the time, in the 90th minute it's waste ...
