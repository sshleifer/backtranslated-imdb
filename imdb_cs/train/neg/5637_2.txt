I understand that I want to shoot a movie that is nervous and different. I understand the remarks of the previous reviewer that it is a movie that can not be understood. My point is, once this film ended, the first comment was: "That's what happens when a rich princess wants to be a film star and has no talent" ... ... uses daddy money to make the movie she wrote, directs and pays ..... apparently approaching the movie to realize that there is no character development and no directions like the beginning, the middle and the end ..... the part of the voyeur was good and nervous but what was the point ? I saw that women walk into the house, find some pictures, send the supervisor, go out in a very cold night (unbelievable) to check the noise and overtake her writer ... the film ends ...... does anyone raise my unconscious ars? I really want to know what a question is ... what was the vision of the directors ..... why no development of a dead lover? Why no manager background? What is the point of night vision? What's the sense of lipstick on the car? Why a dead manager? Why are you telling us about a patient's leakage / peeping tom? What is the urn? Oh, and the lamp is that we suppose her house is? Territorial? Why? Why would the manager feel that it was his house? that aspect has never been watched ...... in terms of William Defoe ... I rented this film because it was in him and known for nervous characters ..... write to me and tell me what I need to teach .. I am only mom in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
