If you want to shoot a movie that spreads to ancestors and a "real" star wars trilogy, it will be taxing a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not a filmmaker. a good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not the actor. The first 60-80 minutes are totally boring with just a few pockets of even more light stencils, but there is a lack of edges because you already know which main characters will survive the original star wars. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very fleeting role here, and perhaps the best idea is for Jar Jar Binks to be silent! <br /> <br /> The film is not only captured by the fact that the Chancellor turns on the Jedi and has one great (excessive) sequence in the lava fall
