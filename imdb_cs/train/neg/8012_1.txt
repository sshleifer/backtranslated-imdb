As a lesbian I always search for films about gay and lesbian. However, with such bulls there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story that will develop or just make some sense. It did not happen. There were only insignificant scenes that were in no way related to anything. The film did not provide any character or depth of character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I simply turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it does not even deserve it.
