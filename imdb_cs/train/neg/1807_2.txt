I admit that when I reached the hippie-dippy age, I'm crazy about these kinds of movies. I can enjoy the hero of the hippie genre a lot more than most "normal" people. But this movie is simply horrible in every possible direction. Every bizarre perception of hippie stupidity is presented as a gospel, policemen kill young long hair when a plane lands on a plane. This movie is so terrible that it is not even funny to watch how the goof has gone on excess hippie drone. It's like the left wing version of Dragnet, except for no professional actors. The only reason I gave him two stars was that there was some confusion on the soundtrack, besides, I did not find a choice for negative stars. No actors, almost no conspiracy, sheeze, hardly even a script ... you have an "artistic" movie .... Everything is done on a slow drilling of a channel, stretching every insignificant scene just to fill the time. a bizarre turn of life imitating art, the movie's "nonactor" star joined the real-life community and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his comrades was killed and was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weighting "accident" ... just think it must leave it as an inheritance ... Oy vey.
