Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Bland, useless and pointless. <br /> <br /> Apparently Ash and what. they can travel through time with the help of the "Forest Spirit" ("Princess Mononoke" a lot?) There, they meet the guys a guy called Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get high with nature, they become hippies and try to free Celebi ("Spirit") from some curious guy. I do not even know what else to do. It was all blurry. Ash friends were hardly in it and all the fighting scenes were boring. After rescuing Ash and his infamous friends, they have to return to their time while watching Sam fly away with Celebi (the scene of OO;) Then, upon returning to his time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival grandfather . And I think it is. Quite retarded, right? If you love your children, you will not be exposed to them. (1 of 10)
