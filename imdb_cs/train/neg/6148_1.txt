First, the film was not true at all. I just saw the document a few days ago and the movie was not like that. First of all, Nash was genius in mathematics, and that's what the film should be about the story of a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. There are also lots of scenes that were simply bad - the scene where he was riding with a wheel in the camp, took place in the early university years, not after him. In my opinion, Russell Crowe does not fit this part because he does not look like an intelligent / individualist type, so he could not play. It would be great if she concentrated more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on a dramatized lovelife. At this level, ABM was too hollywood and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he was not mad nor paranoid, and he was on something because people of this nature tended more than we "smaller mortals." 5/10
