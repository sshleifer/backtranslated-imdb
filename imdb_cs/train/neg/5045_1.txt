Clusters of cameras that do not help film: Too long faces in cut-outs where most of the time you feel the lower half of the movie is missing (the screen is cut off) because it seems to be important but you can not see it. There is too much confusion in the film, so these viewing angles become worse and do not contribute to the visual image. <br /> <br /> I like artistically shot movies and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this is trying too hard to be inventive, and I can not help painfully. <br /> <br /> There is nothing left to be attached to any of the characters because they are not processed well enough. To work with other characters, only a few minutes long snapshots are needed, at least with this script + direct + actors. I wonder if some of the most important acting is due to the script and the director or the actors. <br /> <br /> I will keep away from the movies I wrote and directed Le You in the future. What is an unpleasant film for someone interested in this part of history and for someone who has spent time in Shanghai.
