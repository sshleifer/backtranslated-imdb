... so I thought I'd have a few words about William McNamary. It's not the bad way to spend a few hours if you wanted to see him in his tight whites - it's obvious he has run out of it and looks pretty good - or less. There is a long sequence in the cave where he must get rid of his underpants. It's a pretty good feeling when you have to chase Miss Eleniak in buff, only with his hands over his weaknesses. William McNamara is naturally a bit on the lean side, but he has a nice, generous handful of prey. Also, it's time to get out of bed, if you stop the action at the right moment, you can see the whole enchilada. If you like it and you come, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a "road trip" are. I would just like to thank Dennis Hopper for his naked opportunity naked nakedness. Can William McNamara act? Hell, when I know.
