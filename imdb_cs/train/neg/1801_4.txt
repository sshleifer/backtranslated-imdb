Istanbul is another of those foreign films that Errol Flynn has been preparing to support his family in the last decade of his life and has remained without any problems with the IRS. It's a remake of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner's film, which took place ten years ago. Unlike this studio product, Istanbul benefits from this excellent cinema right at the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who exponentially aged in front of the camera in any movie, was too old to play these action / adventure types. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really lack conviction. As for Cornell, Errol's ex-girlfriend plays with amnesia because of the trauma saved from the fire. Both do not remember Errol and are now married to Torine Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has a couple of ugly people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are after some diamonds that have taken hold of him. I have to deal with them too. The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people do not realize today that Cole was a perfect jazz pianist, thinking only of him as a singer. In fact, he was first a pianist, singing was an idea. Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for fans of this type of film.
