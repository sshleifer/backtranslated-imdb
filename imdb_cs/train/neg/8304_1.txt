"Christmas Story" is one of the many popular movies of many people. The ACS was able to take the viewer for the time and place in such a way that he had no film at all. She has sweetness and goodwill, it's rare. So I waited (and waited) for his continuation, "it runs in the family". The film was almost released a few times, only to be dragged at the last minute. When it finally emerged, the IRITF was (and in my opinion) an absolute failure. Sets and cinematography were fine, but the director was totally missing. The film was nothing more than a cash formulation of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected acting. Narrator Jean Shepard, who was one of America's great humorists and stories, was forced to make a false replay of the hot joke he used in the ACS. He flipped over and why he did, I will never know. Somehow he managed to become an annoying, revolutionary parody for himself. Writing and acting at the IRITF is inappropriate and forced. Actors may have seen ACS, but any of the joke and nuances that were in the ACS should not be registered with any of them. It was an embarrassing ghost, and she was stripped of Shepard's dry humor. ACS will always be a real treasure, but the call to IRITF continues to offend all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
