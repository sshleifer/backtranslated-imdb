The idea is good in the name of the people, the killer does not want his only daughter to finish in the institution and ask the parents of the girl he killed to take care of the daughter. And you can expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do some good acting, unfortunately they do not! In the name of people it turns out that this is a regular Friday night tearjerker. Rearmament with the girl who was killed is quite pathetic and at some stage you can just predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good movie on this topic then look at Dean Man Walking!
