This is one of those films that apparently attempted to ride combat waves. Somehow like Billy Jack. However, while Billy Jack had one remarkable martial arts scene, there is no one in this, unless you think of some gentleman's throwing and a crude siege as such. We are familiar with the star described as a teacher of Judah in the Marines. I was in the navy, and when they're really good at boxing, I really do not remember Judo's emphasis. As a result, the antagonist James MacArthur refers to Judo as he offers justification for why he, the champion of state champions, was so easily defeated. Lame.
