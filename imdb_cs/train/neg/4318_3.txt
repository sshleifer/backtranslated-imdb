I thought this was one of the most depressing vacation movies I've ever seen - the other are Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you like to be thoroughly compressed, then by all means look at this movie or any other. In this movie, acting is good and some sceneries (except when people die) are beautiful. But I'm afraid a clinically depressing person could accidentally see the movie and run away! Despite the "happy ending", the main part of this film is one terrible disaster that follows the other. And for some crazy reason I do not want to be deciphered when I watch the Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy people - after all, does not start your eyes and feels miserable what are the holidays at all?). <br /> <br /> For a later viewing experience, try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT Christmas Tree, CAROL George Scott's Christmas or Christmas Story - unless you're afraid of course.
