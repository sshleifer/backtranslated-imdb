I wanted to hit television. Tracking was torture. I hated it. Never look at this movie. Terrorists are uncomfortable. Adam Sandler is uncomfortable. Usually I like but not in this. I wanted to split the DVD. This is the most irritated movie in the world. The comedian he's jealous of is uncomfortable. The only fun part is the black teeth rocker with all the girls. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit television. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM IF YOU CAN NEVER OFFER. If Adam Sandler likes you a little, do not give it to him. You just hate yourself. Make a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it so you can lose all the danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99, which I paid for.
