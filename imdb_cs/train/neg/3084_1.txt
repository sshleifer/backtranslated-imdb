that's the result. A piece of trash film that does not deserve to be classified as a movie is just a lot of stuff on a movie reel, which makes no sense at all. Let's get back to the actors who seem like a lot of friends who thought they would get a small amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's really great horror, it's never a movie. There is a lot of scary acting in "Hobgoblins", but worse is a major guy named Richard, who is just too weak and even a sorta root. Well, when you're building up your friends and trying to make the movie scary, for less than sixth budget, no less, that's what happens. Oh, at least the version of MST3K was cheerful. But it's still a scary movie that deserves all the bashing. 9 for the MST version.
