The idea of ​​air transport miniseries in Berlin seemed to me to be one of the most interesting German (post-war) films. This is a topic that has not yet been explored. Producers of this series, however, clustered clichés. It starts with a DVD movie cover that is a direct copy of the Pearl Harbor envelope. Luis Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) learns that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war, he tries to survive. She finds work at the US base, works in the best and highest officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love, gets pregnant, and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on! We have seen it too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their part quite well; Bettina Zimmermann never seems convincing. For some reason, it always seems to be too late to give the right emotional response to the scenes. It just did not work for me. Action scenes with airplanes and aviation lift, sometimes we are exciting, more often than not. Irregular things have always been the same pilot. If you are not a fan of World War II films, I suggest that you spend money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 of 10!
