Some things need to be clarified. The image of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris, who played in this film. I know because he was my dad. Delete this image. Mark Ferris was also a writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It was years and if someone could point me to get a copy, it would be great. The film was not that bad, trying to compare it to today's world of star wars and other top sciences, it's futile. If you look at it, just enjoy it because of the disobedience and humor it has. Brighten movie snaps and enjoy less creative and innovative movies.
