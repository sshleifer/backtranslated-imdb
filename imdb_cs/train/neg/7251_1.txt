Great Western I hear everyone say it! Brilliant first effort! But I'm not sure what movie you were watching, but it had to be different from the one I saw. Great westerns or really good movies of any genre have characters you can trust and this movie did not have! Efficiency was bad to say the smallest and I could not care about any of the characters, so the whole movie is useless. the story was too great for the creators, and maybe they should try to make a low budget directly on TV, as you would see on science fiction programs "FACT OR FICTION". <br /> <br /> You are looking for a good movie, a great western or even a fun hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
