Boy, oh oh holly, the most interesting thing in the movie was the joy of bluescreen effects used to create mom's "invisibility". They looked like they were shooting for cheap video, and it looks absolutely unreal and even in a good case where it's so funny that you finally love a movie ... I did not love this movie. Attempts to "steadicam" shots were really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they have low budgets, it's all right. You can even make a great movie with a low budget. But BAD movie and low budget and effects. This leads to a bad combination. In such a case, such a convicted combo created a cramped film "Invisible Mum". If you have children and your children do not like it, they may still wake up in this whole.
