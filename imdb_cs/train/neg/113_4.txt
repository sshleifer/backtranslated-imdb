Today I found "Everyone laughed" on VHS for sale for rent. It was really old and very used by VHS, I did not have any information about this movie, but I liked the links on his cover: I was attracted by the names of Peter Bogdanovic, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten, the price was very low and I decided risk and buy it. I was looking for IMDb and user rating 6.0 was an excellent link. I looked at "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and? Wow ?? four stars! So I decided I could not waste any more time and I could see it immediately. I just finished tracking "everyone laughed" and found it to be a very dull overrated movie. The characters are poorly developed and I spent a lot of minutes to understand their role in the story. The story is supposed to be humorous (private eyes that fall in love with the women they are chasing), but I did not smile the whole story. Accidents in a huge city like New York are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra, as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women who belong to him as if he were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. Eventually, the presence of the Playboy Center and friend of the year Dorothy Stratten, whose husband was murdered quite after the release of this film and whose life appeared in "Star 80" and "Death Centerfold: The Story of Dorothy Stratten", is certainly the greatest attraction. the amazing beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; always beautiful, even thirty-five, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo" by Robert Carlos. Although I do not like, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 1960s and his fans called "The King". I will be in my collection just because of these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laughs and good luck")
