Okay, I saw the stunning preview of this silly movie. First, the movie is so imagined and not real, they all play. They can not sing. They are too self. That's horrible. Yes, kids like 8 to 10 can enjoy, but it's really stupid. I think they say their manager is a child. And the record labels are fake. It's stupid. You do not see it. <br /> <br /> As far as setup and routing is concerned, it's not that bad. It's a cute documentary, but it shows stupidity. <br /> <br /> You see it only when you really do not like good music. It's also very nasty. It's not even tasteful. I hate to be so bad ... but it really is a piece of junk mail.
