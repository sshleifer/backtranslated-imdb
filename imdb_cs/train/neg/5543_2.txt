Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but last night I watched it for the first time, and I just got into my five best. Was it supposed to be a love story or a zombie ??? This movie was so bad that after the merciful ending of all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Fortunately, I'm too anal to shut down the movie without seeing the whole thing, or I can not boast watching this all the way in one sitting! I like to think that something about life can be said, so in line with this theory I will recognize the most positive contribution of this film, it was a very short film.
