The show was a "bubbling" sound effect that forced me to sleep. Very soothing show. I think I could sleep in places where there was danger or danger. I also heard that some of them made footage for an exhibition of diving divers who had been shot dead in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I suppose Lloyd Bridges will never hurt. I just remember the show in reruns, and although it was never exciting, we'll do our own underwater episodes in the lake at grandmother's house ... featuring echoing bubbling sounds and telling our adventures in our heads. I thought "Flipper" has better underwater action. Of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
