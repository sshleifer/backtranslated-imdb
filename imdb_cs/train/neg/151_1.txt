That's really terrible. The only redemption of the feature of this film is that the next time people ask me what is the worst film of a vampire I've ever watched, I should have a good answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's shot at 35 mm, so it's as pale as hell. I would not bother to comment, but I noticed that some fanboy (probably associated with the film) claimed it was the best Matrix movie. Allow me to reveal myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the movie. Everything shouts. The actress is ugly. Battle choreography is the worst I've ever seen. Battle scenes are incredibly amateur. Imagine that the girl applied helplessly to her hands and delivered weak kicks that would not hurt the kitten. Of course, the director just pulled people out of the street to give them a role in the movie. I know the director did not have a big budget for the movie, but even better movies were created with a smaller budget earlier. Unforgivable.
