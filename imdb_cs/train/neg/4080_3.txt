It looks like one of the movies we think we like, but not. It seemed too hard to be "artistically". All flash, no content. It has some beautiful scenes and each of them is nice to look at, but joins them all together and it becomes a challenging task just to have it. I chased it because of the brilliant views of the video card and the fact that I was a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I've found it to be a bit complicated and sometimes boring.
