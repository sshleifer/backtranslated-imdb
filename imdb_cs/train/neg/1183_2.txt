This and immortal stories left a bad taste in the mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted with sex and these two films are warning stories about what happens if you have sex. As a movie it's not done well - some actor is really epic bad (for example, "American" woman with a French accent). A young woman is a sudden flip-flop because she is interested in marriage (when it seems to be the opposite) and the sudden aunt who realizes the mystery of a young man does not make sense - it is not explained at all . I also did not like how the relationship of a daughter with a black man was introduced as a sign of perversion or seizure of her family when it comes to an animal. The central idea, the idea of ​​being a "sexy beast," if you want to live in the woods, could be the basis for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a base for ugly, negative, morale.
