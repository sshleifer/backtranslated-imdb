Contains spoilers Movie enthusiasm can be summarized in several sentences: Three guys go hunting in the woods. Two of them, along with other people, are shot dead without explanation. The last guy can become clear, scream and do anything without being shot. He goes through the old factory and has bad people who are immediately in his power to go without a fight. The villains are comfortably dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story that is not summed up, but in detail. Everything is pulled up with a guy who rings the doorbell. We'll wait with him. A long shot of boys who are bored and sleeping in the forest. We can go with them.

If they did, I would be sure it would be much more fun to watch the movie.
