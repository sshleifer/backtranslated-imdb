This British pot-boiler has one thing to do: the young men are uniformly looking good. Older men are the right-wing Thatcherites, whose behavior brings back all the pleasures of the Reagan / Thatcher period. The young or old morals in this three-part mini-series are generally suspicious and nobody gets particularly well. Nick is a handsome young homosexual fresh from Oxford. It's not a story, but it has an exceptionally beautiful hair head, making it much easier to follow this breath. Nick arrives in London with a friend whose father Gerald is a wealthy conservative politician, and his sister Cat's guardian while the family moves in the south of France. They neglected to inform him that when he is upset, Cat catches himself with the assortment of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick understands his "gratitude" for affection and moves, finding out too late how he despises and patronizes him. He has not been living in this house for four years, but how it matters depends on this point, it is best not to doubt it. While Nick is most pleasing to look at, he is unbearably decent. His truce, subject to rich bigots, soon dragged me to the walls. Deeply closed except for a cat (she estimates her big secret in sight), she likes little anonymous sex, so we know he's actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible, Nick will marry a lover who is even more than he. Supercilious Tories despise and offend two blacks in the movie, so imagine the poison that pops out when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in the boulevard. Gerald, in fact Tory fashion, has engaged in several personal and financial scandals, so revelations about Nick's embarrassment. This gives Geral the last chance to win an unlucky boy. In addition to a brief moment of indignation, Nick decides silently and silently to abuse it. Rejection, self-confidence, naivety or ignorance? You decide if you can sit the whole thing without throwing anything.
