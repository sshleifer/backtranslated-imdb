I think they really let the quality of DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from two movie stores and the second time I finally played it on the third DVD player I tried. Does anyone else have this problem? It's really hard to give the movie an un-distorted review after having undergone such an argument to play it. First of all, I have never seen a Finnish horror movie before, so I was a bit bummed that the film was made in English. Since it was never clear what Sarah was wrong with, she just came as a retarder, so I really hoped someone would shoot her face-to-face and all the terrible events would disappear.
