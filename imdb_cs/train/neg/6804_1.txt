It must be one of the five worst movies ever shot. The plot looked interesting as a hurry for Passenger 57. But in the second movie it worked a lot better. The conspiracy was processed in the worst possible way. Just a few of those awful moments in the movie, the stewardess stands in the open door of the 747 flying and tries to close the door without being sucked by winds 250 miles per hour?!? The aircraft then lands from several kilometers to 8000 feet, and this is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When she's on the track (perfectly obvious) she is instructed to pull the flaps, HUH !! Arrive the flaps to ensure lift at low speeds when you use the reverse force on the track to get maximum performance! I can continue with the small and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer becomes the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie that you would like to miss, accept the word for it!
