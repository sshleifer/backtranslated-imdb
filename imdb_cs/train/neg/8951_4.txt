I'm a huge fan of the book and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought a DVD of utter curiosity, Burton is an actor I hold in high regard, so when I heard he played the role of O'Brien, I was rocking. I saw the trailer on DVD first began to appear some concern, mostly when it comes to an inordinately terrible "motif song", hearing Eurythmics mechanically yelling "1984!" again and again to the electronic rhythm is as bad as it sounds. The whole action is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play well their roles and tensions that exist in the Ministry of Truth towards the end to feel, especially in the horror scene of Room 101. However, it is also a place where the movie is off. The film spends too much time focusing on the love affair between Winston and Juliet, which is not quite true of Orwell. He writes about how Ingsoc creates human faith and then breaks them in the name of being loved by a great brother. The film goes over what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons cope with its position in life and the world and its reeducation through O'Brien. The IMDb commentary at this time states that the movie is holding a book is totally wrong. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, hangs up with Goldstein's brotherhood and admits his crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial examples where Winston finds an article with Unpersons, but it is coming to an end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing. A horrible screenplay that some of the great acting can not save. It seems that Michael Radford completely missed the point Orwell was trying to do, and the sound recording of the electronics is terribly awful.
