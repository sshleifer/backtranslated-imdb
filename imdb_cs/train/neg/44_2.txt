I'm not sure if I mean those who have branded this video as ugly or as a director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a bizarre movie "Horror". The plot is loosey goosey combo of excellent films like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." Chick is kidnapped in the "jungle" "tribe" of "savages." The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk in Halloween-style party style costumes of native clothes. And savages range from white to asian to black to Hispanic. I suppose Franco has just caught anyone who looks a little more ethnic for this romp. To make it worse, this film has an extremely minimal gore, no real fears and a lot of unnecessary penis. It's not fun. I can find something that would like only some dirty Italian or Euro-basket movie; this guy just dropped WAY short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
