I've been watching this movie too, and otherwise it's done well, I found the heart and did not recommend it to women with little children. The horror on the face of this mother, when she sees her child, the train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - inside dying. Eventually she returned to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world that makes dolls out of production does not cover the grief it has. I remember the desperate face when she took the money out of her dress to try to make her baby heal. I'm surprised that this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it, I was sure that people came to Cincinnati in Ohio. It was also a way for the poor of the mountains.
