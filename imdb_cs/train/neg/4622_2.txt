No wonder this film has never seen the light of day. The timing of the release was terrible. The Gong Show has already "jumped shark" at the time the movie came out, so who would pay the money just to see some censored clips from the original show cycle? A show clips are just a few of the sad, 90-minute shakes from Chuck Barris about how hard his life has been as a show host. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for his confused millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to know about his life? (It is obvious that he later wrote his strange autobiography about his CIA career.) He thought he had everything and wherever the bankruptcy would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the CEO, who is chasing him all the time? It could work as a story of a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not a feature film. However, it was nice to see again Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and Unknown Comic (though the film was "spicy" only included his most impressive routines). And as somebody else has pointed out, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman's film (although it takes only a minute). Note that his name is written in credits by HARTMANN, which is the name that was born. You can not miss his voice and facial expressions, although he is much thinner and younger than SNL's. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small role; one of his first after leaving the world of soap.
