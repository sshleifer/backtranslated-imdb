This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies EVER, I emphasize EVER. Even worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and play them. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way it is done even caused my body to hurt. Battle scenes for beginners are just as choreographically as a fight between two drunks who push them into a trough. Actor, with the exception of Dolph, who is a little upset, will do so badly that you can not wonder if the reason is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way had to catch the most, if not. Throughout. This is ยง 12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because according to the appearance of effects and scenery, the price can not be a cent over ยง 1000.
