After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and unable to sleep, I decided I could have fun when I suffered from a lack of sleep. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch him. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here is a conspiracy (potential spoilers, if you take care of it): a neurotic addicted person (Josh Kornbluth) works as a tempo for some ridiculous society. Suddenly he is offered the option of "going on a perm", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this film. But with some work and secure income in his grasp, Josh decides for any stupid reason he does not want to do it. He desperately triggers a few small tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition make me despise. His inability to send several "very important" letters over a certain period of time should be cheerful, but he is simply stupid. Josh meets and tricks a lawyer's wife and they break into bed together (of course Josh's fantasy in real life, because such a thing never happens). A lot of other things happen, but it's too trite and stupid to get into it. Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I just laughed twice during it; The first one was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth (my first reaction was scary fear) and the other was when she was in bed with an attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most frightening person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, obese and bald Jewish man I think he has sex with beautiful women. I do not agree with Josh's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated, and I will simply not appreciate unsuccessful attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
