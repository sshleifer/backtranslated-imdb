You have to love syrian low-budget movies. This is complemented by bad effects, props and bad gaming (really bad). Moreover, every time I see Mercedes McNab (sister), I think "watch out! It's a vampire!" - for those who know Buffy / Angel. A perfect example of what happens when someone with a harsh taste and wants to waste money making movies, a little one he has spent, of course. I do not know if I apologize for the film writer or the producer who did not return any money. I would say it's for the little ones in its simplicity, but I do not know if I want to submit him kid ... 1/10 because it's the lowest that's going to go.
