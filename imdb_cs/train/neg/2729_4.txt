Acting philanthropic gesture by actress Ruth Roman, who helps entertain soldiers coming from the Korean War and leaving for an air base near San Francisco, started this Warner Bros. star. greet patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances, while romantic love-hatred develops between staring star and a painfully green and lean rider Air Force (Ron Hagerthy, who seems to be delivering a bicycle newspaper). The Corporal seems to have mislead the actress to think he is in the fight when he is actually a member of the crew of the plane that flies to Honolulu and from him (you think she would be happy to stay out of the accident but to act like most children's children in the 1950s). Doris Day is about the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinctive laughter and nice song numbers are most enjoyable. Roman is also here, looks glamorous while James Cagney has fun on the persona screen and Gordon MacRae sings in his pretty baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in the Doris Day hospital bed, which makes you wonder: "Are kits depleted?" For undemanding viewers, interesting memories of different time and place. Low-rent production and adequate technical aspects still make Starlift a strict second biller. * 1/2 from ****
