Years ago, a movie with a friend appeared and I went to see a horror film that we thought was good because he played John Cassavetes. John Cassavettes, an actress, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowland), was nominated for an Oscar three times, who wrote and directed a bunch of good low-budget films using his actor's earnings to keep him out of the water. Until they saw Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes' earnings were made from any film he had been offered. If we knew what the film was before we could see it, we could totally avoid it. But we did not come out. At that time, I enthused with my excited friend that it was the worst movie ever shot. Now, frankly, that's not true. I saw many movies shot badly on Cinemax on Friday night (I just said aloud?) That are much worse than Incubus. Almost every film with Brian Boswort is, by definition, a worse film than Incubus. Of course, Santa Claus is marrying a worse film than Incubus. However, since then I have consistently used Incubus as a threshold under which I do not want to fall. When I talk to this friend about the movie I've ever seen, I'll always notice that it's better (or worse) than Incubus. Http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
