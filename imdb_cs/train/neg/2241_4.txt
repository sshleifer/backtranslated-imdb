I remember that I enjoyed it for a couple of years, but I come back to it again, I'm curious why. I think it always looks good and the girls are pretty good, but the men tend to let them down. Why oh why in so many English movies about sex, we have to have such stupid men along the beautiful girls? And what's more predictable as a sexual joke similar to the jokes of Confessions, but about a third (when we start enjoying the beautiful Me Me Lai), the film asks us to take it seriously. Not only that the central rock club and the cannabis sequences are very forced and just look compressed. In short, it's not as innocently stupid or intelligent as it may seem. Richard O'Sullivan might have been able to help as a central figure, but I think this is one of his worst performances. It's worth the ladies.
