One of the more "literate" Lone Stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialogue and negotiation. The opening scene creates a scene (literally) about the personality of a gambling player, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) and his friend John Scott (John Wayne) rodeo (they call the Roh-Day-oh) star, lazy. The film follows their adventures as they try to chase Mexican Juanita best and later to Mary Kornman, who has an inevitable evil brother (though he was taken from a real villain and wants to regret). And, of course, they are wrongly charged with two crimes and must serve them before they escape and are freed at the end. The main point is Scott, who continually and intentionally reflects on her buttocks grocery store and knocking on the ladder she is standing on to catch her and catch her falling. It all looks a bit contemporary for the 1930s, but it sounds better than it really is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the interesting action features we find in many other Lone Stars are very missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad use of serial records of horses belonging to horses. No, George Hayes. The awesome drum game between Scott and Charlie, when Charlie scrolled over Scott, Scott turned on his leg and then split him (he repeated twice). Experienced Paul Fix is ​​misused. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star bend, is not really credible like a morning side kick. The villain looks too old and fat. Likewise, Chandler, who spent his later career in the next 300 films, was like unhealthy meat. Mary Kornman of the 1920s "Our gang" (see "Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in his scenarios with John Wayne, but this is for this. The better Western seeds lay here. An extremely short, colorful version that looks good moves so fast, it's finished if you're flashing more than once, but fortunately, embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler have been interrupted.
