Another made for a TV piece of junk! It was an insult to a war film (I used the word movie in its smartest possible form!) I thought that Telly Savalas's career was hit by the rock bottom when he made a voice on this Birmingham video that's shown on Tarrant on TV on semi regular but then I forgot to participate in it! I tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but the cable television brought memory that was kicking and shouting out of me! <br /> <br /> I like the piece (sarcasticly laughing!) in a movie that claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the 1960s, but it is obviously a shot of Zagreb cathedral in the late 1980s. Commando's steam train also trains clearly on the locomotive side of the JZ (Yugoslavia Railways or Yugoslavian Railways) logo, even though the manufacturers tried to discard them. Why not just a movie in the UK if it's where most movie is set? <br /> <br /> Cheap rubbish and wasting celluloid!
