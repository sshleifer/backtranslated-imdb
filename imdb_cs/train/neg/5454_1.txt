Wow, this movie was just bloody scary. In fact, it's so bad that even though I did not see it, I still wanted to return my money. The film is nothing easy to understand. These are mish-mash sci-fi clichés that have been made by much more highly qualified film makers. The performances, especially the lead, were over the top in the less-sophisticated Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he'll be proud of him. It's just silent, no hint of irony or sense of humor. Besides, it does not make sense or make a conspiracy or is missing. The visual effects are fine, but it is not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they just look to be thrown into "being cool" rather than being a good fence device. Soundtrack was another mishmash thing that really never set a mood. Again, the director seemed to throw the songs in the quest to "be cool". Which brings me to my last point. Perhaps if the director actually cared for a conspiracy, story, and dialogue instead of trying to "be cool," he would not do such a short film cliché of a "short film."
