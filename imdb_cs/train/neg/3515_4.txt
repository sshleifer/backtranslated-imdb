Essentially a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But a few things occurred to me. First, the use of pointed epithets. In two cases, the Scott character mouths one, once in the beginning when the bomb drops from the target during the bomb-off ("damn") and once when trying to swing the bomber to be a pilot ("s *% t"). In the second case, I can go wrong, but I repeat it repeatedly, and that's what seems to me. The third is when I want the character of Anne Shirley to have a good reputation for O'Brien and "Give 'em hell" over the engines. She had to think it was too unpleasant because it clearly said "heck". I have also noticed interest that has moral problems with bombing, specifically by bombing civilians. The senior chief officer assures him that only military targets will be affected by the accuracy of the bomb. Given what we know about LeMay's later strategy of ignoring Japanese cities into oblivion, this scene plays a bit of irony. I recall that McNamara quoted LeMay in "The Fog of War", something like that if the US did not win the conflict, it would be called a war criminal. The end is exaggerated in terms of film. Reminded me a little bit of the end of White Heat (I'm not comparing films, just ending!). Maybe it's because he got into the air. Blowed up really good !!!
