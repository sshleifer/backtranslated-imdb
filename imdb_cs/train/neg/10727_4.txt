The film is only worth the attention when you stop it after half an hour. It starts with entertaining conversations at the bar and it is expected that a good, fun story will appear. Well, I can tell you it will not come. It will worsen in a few minutes in a movie that casts doubt on your patience, as well as the feelings of shame for the actor, to what extent you will not be pleased to be witnesses. <br /> <br /> In the interview, I heard that the director wanted to express the sense of loss of identity in this film, which, according to him, most people in this globalizing world experience. I was overwhelmed when I heard it. Do I live in the same world I live in? Okay, a lot of people are walking in the same clothes as mine and listening to the same music and everything, but it does not make me feel like losing my identity. What does Khrzhanoska think we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Am I shortsighted or is it? Well my vote: a good beginning of the movie saves it from getting 1, decent 4 is my conclusion.
