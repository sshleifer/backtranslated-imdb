When I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but it would be funny. Well, I was wrong. Though some deeper producers had an interesting message to let parents know that their parents are lonely and rethink their lives, the way they tried to send that message was terrible. The first fifty times something silly that became a couple was relatively fun. But in the end I could foresee what a stupid accident will happen next. Throughout the movie, I like five different lines of dialogue, and everything else is in the best case of the media, which is more than I can say for the film itself.
