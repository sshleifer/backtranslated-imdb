I loved Adrianna Curry before this show. I thought she was great in the Top Model and was really glad to win. I also liked Chris Knight, I feel like a great guy. But this show just made me SICK! I'm so angry they were involved. I do not care that they are different ages, I know that age can not be in love. But Adrianne, you were together in just seven months. I was not surprised that he did not find it. And I do not see the attraction of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. If it is to be, then why not just enjoy each other's own company and love each other and let it come naturally? The transformation of the wedding ring into a ball and chain was totally unnecessary, it is foolishly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you that you disintegrated and suggested her anyway! Have you gone through two unsuccessful marriages, how could you get to the next, just because she was fitting? I hope this relationship will last, but I really believe that marriage has been swift and for all the wrong reasons. Perhaps they can breathe now and find the right reasons to marry.
