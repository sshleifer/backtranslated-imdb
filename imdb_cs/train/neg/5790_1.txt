This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says that acting is great and that casting is great has never seen a media cinema. The game is clearly terrible in the first five characters you meet. Lame. I feel that all the other "rising" comments had to make people connected with the creators. I was not overwhelmed with the story, but I wanted to see some beautiful landscape in Oregon, and there was some decent cinematography - but casting was something that inspired. I think this film also makes a mockery of the generally noble notion that something deep in Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost, and that recovery is useful and possible. It puts jokes in a bad and very obvious place, and I think it's written by the Foreign Ministry or something like that. Back to the board. I even think that this film deserves a place in the same neighborhood of classics as Harold and Maude is totally retarded and along the same line of stitching and prejudice and "joking" as it is uncontrollable in this film.
