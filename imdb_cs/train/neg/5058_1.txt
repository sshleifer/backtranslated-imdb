(When will I ever learn?) An eccentric NPR reviewer was thinking that this Turkish citizen is another citizen. Let me allow myself to bleed my spleen ... I confess: the setting, probably New York City, has never been so ugly and uninteresting. I remind you that the 1970s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all smoking -! If the plan was to cheat the figures, he succeeded. For a movie that works (at least according to my simple estimate), there must be at least one sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty approached and I could not wait for Nicky to finish. If Mikey had been hitting a crazy flipper, it could have given me more than one arm of indifference. I can not remember when I so hated the movie. I suppose I'm a ruby ​​that does not kick off "artistic" moves. Oh, okay.
