With such movies, you know you get the usual ghost jokes. Eve as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It's the direction and the story that is missing. This could be overlooked if jokes were working better. The problem is only that there are not many jokes. I certainly laughed a few times. Besides the talking parrot, there was no trace of creativity in the film. I blame the director for not using this assumption that he has full potential. Eve certainly has a comic skill to show more, but she did not get the chance to do so. Overall, this movie is perfect for Sunday afternoons. In addition, it can be omitted altogether.
