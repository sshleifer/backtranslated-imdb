I can not think about what to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to look. There have been so few redeemed features that I do not even know where to start. The conspiracy ranged from unlikely to totally absurd. My whole body was strained all the time because I could not wait for the horrible thing to end. By the end of the movie, I felt a sense of relief. <br /> <br /> Editing was bad, acting was sub-par and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was occupied as a native American, though not much like a native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If the movie is idiot, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. It was not. It was just pathetic.
