This film reminds me of a lot of drugs of the 1950s and 1960s because it was made by people who apparently never experienced the social evil that warned us. Tom Hanks and his buddies are "role playing," but there are no cubes, lots of candles, and then you just disappeared in the wrong assembly to show Hanks fall for the lady in the group. Quite funny but bad. I wonder how many poor children have destroyed their D & D affairs and they have been told that their imagination is a way of destruction. As a film is basically extracurricular extraordinary, bad acting (though Hanks shows some of his talents) and relationship interviews, and no one seems to have any fun. These films seem to have a psychological focus on teenagers who are starting on the road to adulthood, which is probably far more serious and requires you to get down and do what others do. In spite of my voice of 2, it is worth seeing because of its unique genre, the scary films I personally consider to be quite fun.
