Parasomnia has interesting spaces, but the story is wrong done without any strain or even logical approach. The cast was not convincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in films like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) except for Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the big Re-Animator trilogy). But in sleep it can play a role like this (which is something it does here). The main problem is that action characters do not make sense at all. The story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects combined with some bloody scenes, especially at the end. It could have been a lot better, I do not have this good review. It's under the average really.
