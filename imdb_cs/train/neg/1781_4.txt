Written by Stephen King, this treatment is not as solid as most of his film stories. Mother and son move to the small town of Indiana with mystery. They are Sleepwalkers, feline creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus signs of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is excellent as a mother. Others appear Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Take a look at the very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as administrator of the cemetery.
