That's why many people stay homeless. . . because stupid producers pay the money to make terrible movies like this, instead of donating if they can bother! This film is even worse than white chicks! The little man has a lame excuse for being a child like a girl. The story is terrible because it was written by six people. The idea, however, would not be too bad if it was original and not a break of the episode of cartoons. it has fun moments but some of them are overcome and some are simply stupid. The game was very, very bad. He was also the director. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of each other. is racist and very offensive. I mean, instead of showing sympathy, the filmmakers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see little things like kids. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned child, just to get a diamond from a family. That's his poor apology for seeing something like that. It just is not worth it. Do not search for this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
