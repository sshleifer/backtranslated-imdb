Django ballad is a meandering disorder of the movie! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other films (and much better!) That allegedly tied "Django" and said how he brought various dungeons. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this if you do not just have every movie Django and even that it may not be a good enough excuse to see this!
