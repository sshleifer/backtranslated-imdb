I saw it recently on the cable and enjoyed it a little. I read the comments here, and everyone seems to like the second half more than in the first half. I personally liked the first story (too bad, which was not extended.) The second story, I thought, was a clich√©. And "California Dream" if I hear once again ... Chungking Express is fine, but that's not something that mainstream viewers will catch, such as "Crouching Tiger."
