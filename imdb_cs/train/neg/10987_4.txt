I really liked Margaret Atwood's novel "The Robber Bride" and I was thrilled to see the movie version. A woman attracts a cop to her own murder, and his friend, a former cop, a journalist, tries to erase her name by checking the crazy girlfriends of a dead woman. It is fortunate that the film script entitles Mrs Atwood's clumsy plot by focusing on the story of these two men, the victims of chanting women ... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are listed in the book and I'm sure they're completely ready for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my copy. It seems that the three main female figures of the novel are not enough to carry a film. Zenia manipulace is not interesting if we do not see it become a human, and the life of man is destroyed. Pink, Charis, and Toni tell their stories - men. Because it's not important if you do not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It would hurt if they saw them being pushed aside for the story of a man. Usually, I do not look for feminist angles on the media and I tried to enjoy the film as it is. If I did not read a book, I could enjoy the film much more. So if you like a cop and a former policeman and want to read more about them, you're not lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy kind words and characterization finely laminated through a plot. It is the same plot: the film dug it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with a man's anxiety. It's like Zen's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
