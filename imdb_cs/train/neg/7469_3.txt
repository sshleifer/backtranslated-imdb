The script for the TV series is so bad that even A. Hopkins did not have to play as a pupil in a drama at some point to bring some life into his hidden character. I do not know if it was the director's purpose, but Hopkins's Ciano felt nothing but vanity, fear, and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano was maybe everything, but then, why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his long journey down was as close to the truth. Edda Mussolini was just ridiculous (not because of Sarandon but because of the impotent script), while she had to be the central character of this alleged family drama. Watch this only if you like Venezuelan soap opera.
