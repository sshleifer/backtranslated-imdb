Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the envelope in the video library? No. Was it a "meal of thought", how did the author try to do it? Not really. So what was that? It was a very average film that had great potential and was nicely focused, but letting the story go without the strong points, started in the middle and the end, and the bad acting expected from a serial killer who at some points seemed to have overcrowded the best performance of the overall cast. It was a nice cinematography, good colors, cool hi-tech stuff, beautiful scenes, but you keep losing where it is and where it was. And with the feeling that eventually we eventually wrap it. Look well if there's nothing else on TV.
