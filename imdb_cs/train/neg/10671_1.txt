MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst action movie I've ever seen. First, you will find that the shooter has no bank account or history since he left the army in 1993 and paid his cash in cash. In hell, it is not possible that such a person would ever be so close to the president, not to mention a highly profiled job. Also, the security chief for POTHU would not be so emotional to start drinking in the fog if the president was shot dead. This film is soaked. I can not say the extreme that this movie was. Each individual actor was terrible. Even a cat in a trailer. I'm on this garbage. What a waste of time.
