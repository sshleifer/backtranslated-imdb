There are so many fucking things about this movie that I can not name but a few: <br /> <br /> BOGART is a character: 1. Its name? Whip McCord (too easy, so let it go. Boy, he does that Humphrey sounds good.) 2. His long, curly hair and silly chops. 3. His black Bart got up, complete with spurs! 4. Do not know what the hue of lipgloss is wearing, but it's not too flattering. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does no favor, either. 2. The man is absorbed by his hat all the time! Could they find the hat that would suit him? Even LITTLE? !!?!! 3. His trousers are too back. 4. Blow smoke out of the gun too many times if you know what I mean and I think you will do it. If you are a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney and imagine it may be a change of tempo to see them in the west, do a favor and forget about this idea. WHEN KOND EMBARRASSED! (That is, when you get bored again.) <br /> <br /> In all justice, I admit that Westerns are my favorite film genre, but I still have seen a lot, much better than this. <br /> <br /> At the level of comedy or as a high camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, the viewer is careful. For this reason you only need to see if a) you have to see every Western one, b) you are TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments to you. Woah ?? ..
