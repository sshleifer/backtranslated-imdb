I have to say I hated this movie. I do not want to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. For about half an hour of boring conversation, I apologize to all who really did the conspiracy, I quickly started forwarding to Gerry's scene. I really do not know the end, I was bored. If Gerry was not in it, I probably did one of two things: he fell asleep or switched off, but Gerry is the clear light of this film, like most of his earlier films. If you're a fan of Gerry, do not worry, it's just as adorable and precious as it always is, but if you really want to look at a plot for a plot, good luck, because you need it, whether it's a lot of coffee or soda to wake you up! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's just because the casting director had a sense of putting Gerry into this movie, even though they had no idea how to pronounce his name!
