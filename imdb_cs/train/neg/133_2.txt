The reason why this happened in the cinema was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible juvenile movie slasher. I think we did not have enough of it yet? Screaming and scary film at least did not accept themselves! The story is rushing and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only film that competes in the worst of what I have seen in the cinema with this. <br /> <br /> In the story, so many plot of holes and girls are so similar that you do not even kill , who was killed and who did not (and you do not care.) The only one I knew in advance was Denise and she was the least talented actress I've ever seen in this bad apology for the film. (2/10)
