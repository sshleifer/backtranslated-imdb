It was not the big disaster I expected, but it's as positive as I have in the film's description. I'm not sure what should be ridiculous for this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, it does not make me sad to watch fools who live in idiotic life or are crazy on TV, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's silly daily talk show. I did not think I was too bored by watching it, but I certainly did not even like it. If you are in the mood to see a bad film, but one that is not too painful to sit, it's a good choice.
