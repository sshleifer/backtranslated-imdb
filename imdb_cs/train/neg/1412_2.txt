Watching this movie I came up with a screenplay for a movie titled "Making 10 items or less": <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is we can get Morgan Freeman! Writer: That's great! But what's wrong? Manufacturer: We can only afford to hire it for one day. I think we'll have to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So let's hire him for one day. The film is an hour and a half long. The working day is eight hours. I do not see a problem. Producer: But ... it will have to spend time getting into nature. Writer: So we have to play him a character that is basically alone. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will have to understand his motivation and everything. You're not saying we have to play it big name, which makes a low-budget movie, huh? Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: This is ridiculous! But all right, at least in our film will be Morgan Freeman. And I think we have to set up a movie in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a damn thing. We should make money. Just in case Morgan Freeman is Plug Wal-Mart or Target, or one of these stores, at least someone will want to sell a DVD. Writer: Sure! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a minute ... what is a small point with "ten items or less" express lane? Writer: Oh, I think it's pretty weird. But now we can not change the name! I doubt that my script actually resembles reality, but not even "10 items or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing and I hate it to happen. When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to say a message. I think they might have tried the tired old "do not let anything keep you back" message that was at the end of death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 items or less", the only message I got was "Look at Morgan Freeman!"
