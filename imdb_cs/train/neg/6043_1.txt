you have to see your comments on many movies under Evren Buyruk .. I'm off to comment on a movie that's not even going to talk for a minute ... This movie is basically two hours of Dafoe character drinking alone - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough footprints or knowledge of nature to be surprised. It was just a terrible and sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is an outstanding actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie is just soaked. Slow film does not worsen, it was bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings anamorphic details are not synergistically connected in a meaningful way to the plot except to highlight some gore, which is illustrated from several views, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as fun it made me sleep. (I really fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointed.) Generally, I do not like to make negative comments or reviews on others' works, even if sucked, but this movie was entitled to one. It is a bad thing that these great actors have been ashamed with this end result.
