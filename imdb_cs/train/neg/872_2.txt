At first I expected that "Caged Heat" would be in the same spirit as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In no case is the abuse of this movie, "Chix in Chains" or "Women in Prison". Sure, the conspiracy consists of a lot of women in prison who wear street wear btw (quite comic), but NEVER will happen. There is no strong rivalry, no one attempts to lead an administrator or a doctor to try to escape and not to impose any prisoners. There are 2 shower scenes that I suspect are just recycled shots, but no fights will explode / no one is seduced - or anywhere! In addition to lack of conspiracy, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat faces, a few prisoners who have escaped will actually return to prison to "free" their fellow citizens? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should just end up with escapes going to sunset ... unlike this mess going on! <br /> <br /> I feel scammed.
