Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever shot. But not the bad kind of bad movies. This is so terrible that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas apparently does not have a lucrative career in acting. He should return to gymnastics. But who can forget such unforgettable scenes as a tall bar with chalk, a rock crest horse or a five-minute walk through the village of singers in slow motion. I do not think it should be bad, but who can say it. It's not an art, but if you want something light and fluffy to have a good conversation, borrow a gym. Makes fun in the evening.
