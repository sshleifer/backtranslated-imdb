I was so excited to see this movie after the last reading of this book. My 13 year-old son enjoyed it. I rented myself and pressed myself to enjoy the classic holiday story brought to life on the screen. Boy, I was disappointed. This movie has disappeared from the book more than forgiven. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but it seemed like he was only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time was totally flat. I realize that it was done in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it seemed to be a high-quality B-movie, especially a meeting with Jacob Marley. The biggest disappointment was that they skipped one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit Christmas Gift takes Scrooge to a whirlwind tour of the world, he watches people in the worst conditions that still have light and love for Christmas. I admit that Mr. Scott did a good job of "reforming" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing picture. I wish Bob Cratchit was portrayed as a bit more dwarf. And Tiny Tim ... oh, you do not even start me with bad kids actors ...
