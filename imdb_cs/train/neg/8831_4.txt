When I heard so many people trying to make the movie, I thought I'd do it. Besides, I'm incredibly slow, which I do not mind if she's waiting to wait, but it's just not. Like many others, they say there are so many inconsistencies, and so much of this movie simply does not sound true. The responses of four men go from shock, horror in search of the body to total indifference as they fish. Sure, if these were the men who would happily fish, then they would just report their body and say that they discovered it after a fishing trip ... Why bind the body on a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body two days ago? It's so hard to watch the movie because he knew the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the other inhabitants, you would think that at least one of them could show a little curiosity about who the woman really killed! The body itself, naked except the buttons ... what scenario does it lead to? If she was raped, why are there any buttons yet? If she had been raped with clothing, why would she remove them? If she was not raped, why would she take all the dresses out of the bars ... and leave her with the evidence to get rid of her? I really can not think of any realistic scenario that would lead to someone else than to kill someone to steal their clothes so that you can fill up your fashionable booth sale! Well, just because despite the bad screenplay, acting is strong.
