This film created a lot of white boys who went to school together. Well, it's nothing wrong except that it looks like it was made by a group of white boys who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white men of the same age. It's almost like watching a lot of boys in the boys' camp who turned the camera to themselves. The movie has no story. It simply repeats the same effect of blood bathing on the blood bath. There are some fun scenes and comedy bits. But they do not equate the essential monotony. Scenes of cartoon drawings are used to cover things that are clearly beyond their budget or resources, and they do not do well. Anything that can not be done with white boys circling on a beach covered with blood is done with cheap animation. I went to see this movie after I saw a trailer, which looks like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are just as good as they would. The rest of it just repeats the same worldly, sad comedy. It works at times, but it's boring after the same things come to you over and over again. It's more like a Satuday Night Live skeet than a movie. It's a comedy that will surprise you. I see where the story is interesting. But in this film after the apocalyptic America, it is similar to Medevil in England. In fact, Wheatlry says stories are coming from that time. He plans to make part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe he's doing a parody. When opened in LA, Wheatley mentioned that he would bring almost the same cast in part 2. He was asked if he could think of a more diverse cast in the next one to which he replied, yeah yes, sure.
