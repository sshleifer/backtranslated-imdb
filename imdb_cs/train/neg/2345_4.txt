I watched in the windmaking where Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just a bloody scarecrow - was to be a charming millionaire - instead, the go-fence was stupid and survived and the 3 " romantic "leads no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won Oscar for Best Actress Act - although her camp trampled character was boring - she thinks that the older Sister of Splendor in Travo was filled with anger and bitterness and lacked charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the whole cast to convince his way through a dialogue that felt compelled and the end result was a loss of 99 minutes. It was a game actor who played the boss on Get Smart
