Director W. Murnau wisely adhered to the silent film he knew so well as to cover this story of indigenous Icelandic life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well in the first half of the film. The landscape is beautiful and everyday activities of the islanders are interesting. The film, however, loses its momentum when it focuses more on the narrative story of two condemned lovers. The story never gets interested in it even though Murnau treats him well. He has earned an Oscar for best cinematography, although the prize should probably be the best scenery. You can not really count DPs for filming in such a beautiful location.
