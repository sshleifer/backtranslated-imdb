Imagine his, say, 12-1am - your home, your bored, yours not tired. This scenario appeared in about 4 years. I switched on the TV and ran a few channels and found this movie turned on. OH MY WORD this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A fugitive car that can not stop (because the brakes were cut or something like that) when they sank it on the highway - what's going to happen ?! This movie was so bad that it is really funny - I think the pieces cost about $ 2 for production, there was one case when a baby / baby is exported from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a comfortably placed bridge is coming forward. .. THIS IS THE BEST WEAK BIT OF THE FILM ALL - It shows that the child has lost the bridge, but it looked so bad - you can almost see the dummy used - the low budget of the classics! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it's great <br /> <br /> I doubt the movie will reappear, so I'm glad I saw this waste!
