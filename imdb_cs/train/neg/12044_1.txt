He came to see Troy in the afternoon. Here's what I've learned: Unlike general beliefs and history in general, Greek men were not homosexuals. AT ALL. This was clearly set forth immediately at the beginning of the movie and reinforced every five minutes or later. So it's safe to see this movie for US movies. Helen Troy always had perfect hair and make-up. She looked beautiful in all her short film scenes that, although numerous, were probably all shot on the same day, one by one, the director said, "Okay, you look beautiful now ... well ... OK looks terrified ... good ... now you look depressed ... good ... now interested ... good ... now looks beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Bridge Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act. The Trojans looked the same as the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt will not squeeze the camera. <br /> <br /> The biggest line of Helena Troy was: "They come for me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way. Achilles had a young friend with whom he was very close, but it's okay. They were cousins. It does not matter what history says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell the whole story only with an expression. <br /> <br /> The Trojans had probably all of the Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or as Peter O'Toole in drag. <br /> <br /> The Greeks never touched until they fought, just like the Americans. <br /> <br /> All thousands of accessories in the movie had the same color of skin ... Light Egyptian, Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of blond Greeks, which is a good news for Brad Pitt who would otherwise be really exhausted. Despite their coastal desert location, the Greeks had the unique ability to find unlimited quantities of wood to build fires, burial pyres, Trojans, and so on. </ br /> <br /> The British actors look stupid with Greek hair. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes the expression only when the sun shines right in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The Greek soldiers were constantly fighting, but their clothes always looked impeccable. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore lingerie under the skirts. <br /> <br /> It seems that the Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were all new.
