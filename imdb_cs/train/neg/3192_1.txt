What left the reviewers and MST3K is the best (and unforgettable) scene of this otherwise horrible film: There is a very good scene of Ben Gazzara look-alike on Maria (as mentioned, later killed by TJ being incapable). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, a "ritual to cover jail" may be more appropriate. The backdrop behind this chance, yet a forced encounter is a gangster who hides "Ben Gazzara", introducing him to the girls hanging by his pool. The 30-ish blonde predetermines him, but our thief must be hit, because there is silence at that moment. His first step is to try to drown her until his mafia, adventurer, tells him to liquidate him. Something like the girl in high school did not like you, but she wanted some kind of bodily knowledge ... Just let her say she was with her in the cottage later
