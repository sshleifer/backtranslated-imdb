Antonioni's films are not good. What always surprises me is that besides the undeniable plastic beauty, there is a confusing and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, the interviews between Mastroianni and "bad capitalists" who want to sing in "La notte" or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting on a "La aventura" train, or Ferzetti dropped his glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I reviewed "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are lots of nice and complicated footage of the Rod Taylor office, LA streets and roads, ad listings, deserts, etc. That show the author's fascination in his American way, the same as Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are a lot of hippie-leftist clich√©s that spoil the movie: The boy leaves the meeting, steals the plane and flies through the desert to free himself and find "something else." - Leadership in gray barrels still talks about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - Some of the thick middle layers in the caravan speak in front of the beauty of nature that builds the hotel and makes a lot of money. - Last but not least, lots of couples they love in the desert. What is hippie crying! Sorry, today, half a century after the "Revolution", "La Aventura", we see the king naked and his films (except "Le amiche" and possibly "Il grido") are just a handful of aesthetics and common places.
