Someone had to seriously joke when they made this film. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is absolutely impossible for this film to be created in 1993. Fashion and music dictate that it is really the 80s. My guess is that this has been sitting on the shelves for a long time before an angry distributor picked it up and let him into an unbelieving world. There is a conspiracy. Species. Stranger himself meets a casual man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite piece, he will be able to turn to whom he chooses. At this point I feel obliged to emphasize that the favorite song itself is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is it his favorite song? Because he's an idiot. We are just a minute into the movie and the film has already reached a monumental level of stupidity. It is even more stupid. The loner is the nose carrier. I can only assume this, because there are two scenes in the movie where it is seen that she chooses her nose. This clears the title. She decides to change to a girl to get closer to other girls. And kill them. That's more or less it. <br /> <br /> The performance is ubiquitous. Every performance in this movie is upset. In fact, I would go so far as to say that acting is the standard of pornography. It's really terrible. The picker's nostrils appear to the audience as a carrier. The characters in the movie see him as the girl who became singer of London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot who even writes it. Anyway, it's a little weird to see middle age strangely hanging with school girls. And not good. There is even a huge set of scenes where the hole carrier is in the school with the girls and the song plays over the top. It is perhaps the worst song recorded. I will not even describe it. You will know when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, of course. And there is a Benny Hill-style pursuit sequence that includes transsexual. There is even an immortal dialogue that may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the picker nozzles say prostitutes: "I have cash if you have blood." Beautiful, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Utter nonsense.
