I admit that I do not expect much from Roger Corman. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. Still, I'm pleasantly surprised in this case. Gunslinger is a story about women (played by the courageous Beverly Garland), who takes over the sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a pretty good shot and kills one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Its first task is to shut down a local bar that violates the city's ban on going. The owner of the bar is trying to buy land in anticipation of being redeemed by rail (expected). However, Mrs. Garland has a thorn in her plans, and the matron bar hires a man who kills Miss Garland. Since Mrs. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "They are Sheriff" jokes. With the exception of a few false passports (the doors in the apartment that open from the inside, the jeep tracks and the two riders are waiting on the screen to return around the corner), the film becomes a valuable film fare. Corman, however, could not resist his film filming scenes with horses, just as he did in other films. Sterno says Gunslinger is a horse opera that's worth your time.
