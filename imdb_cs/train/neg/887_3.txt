After the success of "Paris, It's T'Aime," a group of directors decided to gather and create a similar anthological style film based in New York City. Unlike the original movie, it seems that the stories of this movie sometimes come and go too fast - at a time when you think they get into the story, it's in many cases. And they often start and stop and then start again - with stories woven together. As a result, there is no name indicating that the story is complete and that it is less formal. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, Is T'Aime" was hit or miss (most of the hit), most of the "New York, I Love You" was missing. Stories tended to be much more sexual, but also much less sweet - and often quite terrible. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories - and it often seemed that music is often depressing. Now he understood it was good music, but her real tone really made me feel like a wrist cut! Among the better ones was the story of a young man who took the girl on a wheelchair for a ball, a couple talking about cheating outside the restaurant (though it was also in the first movie) and the comb old couple. That's all so sad because I loved such a movie - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they were trying to do, but she simply did not like it. By the way, and that's not really a complaint, but I was surprised at how many people in the movie smoke. For a recent movie that was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. Also, if you get a DVD, two segments are included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing cool fedora) eating hotdog .... and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. Second is a dancer who spends the film shooting the world - including a very unhappy couple.
