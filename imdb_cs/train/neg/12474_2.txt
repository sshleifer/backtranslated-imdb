I saw the release of MST3K "Deathstalker III" and loved the film so much that I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought myself and II and settled for laughter. Nothing on "Deathstalker I" was funny at any level, and when credits grew, I was embarrassed and sorry to have bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I think either "DS 3" is a much cleaner production, or MST3K really edited because I was expecting something similar, that's stupid and carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even for $ 6.99, it seemed like a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" because I'll be back tomorrow. Now I'm probably just throwing out this DVD because I can not go back and nobody wants it - including myself! So, really, do not worry about this. Even nudity (lots of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
