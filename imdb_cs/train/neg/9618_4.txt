I have to say, although this movie was formulated across the entire area with a stolen film like Friday, 13th. / I know what you did in the summer, this movie was not that bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of Hollywood's horror films recently released. The murders, though sometimes too thoughtful, were in most cases only original. The cast was average, which can be expected from low-budget features, but far better than what a much larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio offers. My only real complaint that was not caused by the budget of a movie that had to be small was the contrasting "twist" that ended. I'm sorry, but this is the movie that gave me the wrong category for me. The end was just stupid and strapped. Before that, I was a bit bored, but he really enjoyed it. 4/10
