I've been watching the movie recently, and it's bad about the book. I blame it on poor scenario and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (a scene of gay rape) for no apparent reason. Actually, I read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many inconsistent ideas that have been introduced without any benefit ... other than the sensational part of time. Since it covers things that were considered "sensitive," at least during communism, I see the fascination it produced at the time. It's not like that, or maybe I see things differently or both. The film is trying too hard to cover many aspects of the book, which is the result of scenes that can make sense to someone reading the book. Still, it's a movie that's hard to watch and maybe never have to do.
