I saw most of My Bollywood Bride at the IAAC Film Festival in New York today and had to leave the theater due to the feelings of sickness that floated in me. I saw movies with Bollywood and I saw Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide who one would want to be, so it ended up like a joke on yourself. It seemed to have been liberally copied from films such as Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what kind of work he did. How can Bollywood ever be deprived of its determination to stick to overused scripts? There is no one who could bring millions of real, fascinating stories to the screen that surely exist and there are billions of people in the country? Extremely intelligent car driver, cow on the street, volunteer scenes from foreign locations, unnecessary scenes from Mumbai Street, are all there. Every possible clich√© on India has been faithfully included. So ominously predictable. ugh !!! Actor's performances are weak across the board except Nehy Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose such a project.
