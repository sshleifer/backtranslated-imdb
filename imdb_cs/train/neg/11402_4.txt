Exactly what you would expect from B-Movie. Derivate, free nudity, boring parts, ridiculous gore and cheese special effect. Of course, it could be better, better understood, better written, directed, etc. But then I thought it would not be movie B. The actors were quite sucking, in fact it seemed like a vampire episode episode or something other than with great blood, shame and nakedness. Tiffany Shepis must be listed. She is absolutely the scream of the queen of the new millennium. Not that acting really depends on these films but was better than any other actor. It also smokes hot, in the plastic suit she worn for the whole movie - wow! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in this dress, I think when she turns around, she can help but check her. And at the end of the movie, the viewer is rewarded by seeing it at all times. So if your freer b-movie horror fan (like me), look at it. If not, you should avoid at all costs.
