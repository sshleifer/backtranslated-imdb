I got a Blockbuster movie in one of those shelves if you could get as much as 5 movies for $ 20. I have to say that I got the money for this. I was expecting a terrible dialogue, miserable monsters and restless cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two of the three are not bad. The game is bad, but not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low-budget movies recently that I lost my perspective. Some bits are that acting is terribly horrible, but for the most part it's at least on High School Play. CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed that I had another appointment) was that the man in the monkey suits would be better. Quiet stop-motion animation would look better. <br /> <br /> So maybe you ask why I called CG the second worst. That's because the worst part of the movie is sound effects. They are loud, uncomfortable, and constant. I was camping, I know what insects sounds in the forest at night, and while they can be loud, they are not deafening like cacophony in this movie. Usually, when the "background" sounds, it drowns a dialogue about the movie, it's a bad thing, but I missed the very thing I caught the dialogue of this movie. The event was unusual and boring. There was no tension, just like any feeling of empathy with the characters. When we talked about the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. The only gentle game was between ... actually, I do not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smash a smile, but it was about it. The cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you would normally see in a movie like this one. However, it still had a "home movie" quality that you will get with the films on your pocket change and prayer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are like me and you get kicks from the handy genre movies and you see this in a dollar basket, think about how you grab it. Otherwise, stay at any cost.
