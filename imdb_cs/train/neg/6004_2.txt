The best thing about camping movies is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or daytime soap opera or Jerry Springer exhibition: you can instantly follow a humble plot, identify cardboard characters and watch with satisfaction when all clich√©s are met. Sometimes, however, the director does not really expect anything. It can be something extra stupid or something strange or something loyal. Director Makinen is there with the best director of the camps and is his best film. Yon saalistajat seems to be gathering everything. It's not good, but he can still be a coherent total. Once the film slows down - action streams and strikes continue to come. The strangest thing is that there is no point in time: some characters take months to do something while other characters have only spent one hour at the bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, when the sun never happened, so you do not have to experience the day when it changes at night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there's a conspiracy, somewhere there. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
