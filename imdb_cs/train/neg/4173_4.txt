I have to say that when I saw a trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, we take the vamp of a bad vampire led by the genre vet Michael Ironside .... In the universe. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential B classical movie. It was undoubtedly a TV pilot, who later re-enrolled in a feature film after not being lifted. Okay, I'll start with the movies a few good points, the event was competent for a lower budget movie, and CGI and the used sites were acceptable. Now the bad Michael Ironside was in this barley and his performance here ... well, it was sweet, not good. But as I said it was not in any way, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was PETA type group for vampires, I'm not joking, it's the stupidest most incredible thing I've seen over time, and it's taken seriously. This film also commits one of B's ​​main movie sins, irritates the lesbian scene and does not provide. Most of everything that sinks this film does not really happen. Since it was a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains are coming to the end. If he ever needed a movie to do it, it's Vampire Wars. At the end I say the main crew on the spacecraft, they were all very capable actors and they could very well put this mess behind them and go on to bigger and better things. They had nothing to do with it.
