In this movie, I have seen virtually no redemption. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly mad obsession for it ... There was an attractive woman in this movie and maybe it's a good quality. Overall, however, I found this film surreal and ridiculous. Handmade filmmaking associated with slow motion and other movie tricks I found clumsy and dizzy, even bad. Overall, music around the world was terrible and repeated to the extreme, reminding me of the US military's military war against various malcontents. The different vignatures that make up the film are random in their location and unfulfilled and unresolved in their content and "conclusions." The depressed film (not true film, the term I reserve for true art) left me feeling bad. Do not trust the different people who are trying to do it and rotate it like a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly isolated elements of both films that reject in the content, form and conclusion of any connection with this genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest they stay away, despite the seemingly stunning positive view of IMDb and other sources of evaluation.
