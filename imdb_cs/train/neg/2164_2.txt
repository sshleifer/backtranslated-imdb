I thought maybe a movie that boasted the cast, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews could be very attentive. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Countable nonsense from the beginning to the end when O'Toole and York overwhelmed wildly. I looked at it twice and I still have no idea what it was about. I feel that O'Toole plays Laird from a Scottish castle that has a drink problem and likes to rejoin the children's games with his sister (York). It's barking too. But besides, your guess is as good as me. <br /> <br /> The film has no redemption. I can only assume that the actor and the director have been blackmailed into doing this sad, unimaginable, terrible piffle. Clearly a waste of time for talented cast and director. Ridiculous.
