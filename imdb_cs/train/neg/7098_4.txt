An interesting idea for a movie that shows the last dragon on the ground and shows the fight that together with someone evil together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark master who gave him half his heart. Now he grew up Einon (David Thewlis) is now a selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend Dragon Dragon (expressed by Sir Sean Connery) to receive a reward for killing the dragons. But because Einon has half the Draco hearings, they both feel the pain in one of them is wounded or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. It's worth it!
