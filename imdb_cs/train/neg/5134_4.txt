SCARECROWS seems to be a surprise horror encounter with a supernatural film. A group of criminals pulled a paramilitary wage salary at Camp Pendleton, California. They picked up the cargo plane that took the pilot and his daughter with a request to be taken to Mexico. On the way, one greedy robber decides to save money with the arrival of money in the maize field, followed by the strange search for scarecrows. They're not just some scarecrows that could kill. The game is no better than horrible dialogue. And humorous attempts are not fun. Very low budget and shot completely in the dark. Cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
