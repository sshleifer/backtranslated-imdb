I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I thought hey, no matter how stupid the movie is, at least I'll see him kick an ass, right? Poorly. This is a blunt, terrible mess of unnecessary talk, a half-dead screenwriter and insignificant intent. There are just a few action scenes of any kind, even fewer scenes with martial arts and few that are sketched and edited so badly that you can not even figure out what's going on in the world. The Oak is also terrible, and perhaps the idiocy that this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it is allegedly the Italian Mafia ... Apart from being all Japanese! Avoid being a plague - see better martial arts by looking through the window of the local pre-school school for five minutes.
