With such a title, you know you get a lot of junks. It works badly. Script bad. Director bad. Grammar is bad. The movie makes a lot of noise that really is not music and a lot of people scream. The film causes a bad racial stereotype. Why come every movie with a black hero has an addict? Why the hero always has to dance to be successful? Why come to the famous rapper always have to be in a dance movie? Why does the letter "s" come in the name? Hollywood must stop the stupid audience and make a movie that has people with a brain who know how to speak the correct English. <br /> <br /> Relax yourself and you will not go.
