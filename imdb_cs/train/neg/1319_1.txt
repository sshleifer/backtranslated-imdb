Probably someone heard about Alberta Tomba. Former policeman, former champion of the sky and now actor TERRIBLE. "Alex L'Ariete" was planned as a television "mini-series", but Italian television itself refused to put the film on its channels. Now, believe me, a funny movie. The script is just funny (it was a dramatic movie), something like a 5 year old child's work. But what really blasted you is amateur acting: Alberto Tomba, who was not really credible as a policeman himself, plays a terribly stupid character: a special operator of an Italian policeman who specializes in breaking the door! ("ariete" is a "ram"). This super-guy will try to save the young girl's dear life (the real Italian "little" television showgirl who married singer Eros Ramazzotto): a nice but absolutely awkward acting. Lose it and make a favor. A film that is a shame to the Italian film industry: only John Travolta in Earth Attack is coming ..
