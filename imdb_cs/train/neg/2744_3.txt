I was boring about 10:00, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way children behave like older than eleven has just broken me. One of the children had a ring that allegedly killed people for three or so years. That made me feel like he was a gangster. It is difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They play like everything that's as big as if Billy (the main character) does not eat worms, then the world is over. This is a good movie for young children (except for the fact that the 5 year old says "penis"), but not for teens or adults who do not want to waste time.
