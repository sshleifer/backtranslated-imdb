I do not know if it's one of SyFy Channel's original movies, but that's exactly what it feels like. The cheap, low-budget action movie, which was probably produced very quickly, contains laughter, a lame dialogue, and a vaguely faded star that gave him a token of fun (how funny how many kids from 90210 do cheap TV movies). Ian Ziering plays Cortese, who we know of history as a explorer who destroyed the entire population of indigenous people while capturing parts of North America. Here he did not play as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slim opportunist; his character would probably be killed if it were not loosely based on the historical number. In this story, Cortes is on a brief reconnaissance mission and is trying to find something that could prove he deserves funding for further exploration of America. He and his men will find a small tribe of Aztecs struggling with dinosaurs. The hero of the story is Lieutenant Rios, who turns out to be honest, inventive and wise. He knows what to do in every situation that puts him in opposition with Cortes, as well as with the young ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the indigenous girl who is about to marry a cruel shaman tries to Rios, and spreads her anger against Spanish foreigners. So it's quite a clich√©. Dinosaurs are broadcast relatively easily. Despite the fact that it takes place in an area that seems to be wide open, the story of almost 95% of the time takes place either in the forest or in the Aztec village, so it is not even visually exciting. <br /> <br /> I did not even know Jan Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and somehow vanished. He does not even speak or talk Spanish for a moment, but casting is wrong. If this movie were to be released theatrically, it would probably be listed on Razzie, no doubt. Overall, he forgot.
