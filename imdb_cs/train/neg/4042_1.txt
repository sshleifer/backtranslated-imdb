The movie is beautiful to look at, but it's like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) does not make sense. But it's very "artistic". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors struggled and looked deep into the eyes. Lots of artistic shots across the windows and people out of frame. Mumbles and people were sad. Permanent close up of faces and bodies. By the time you get to the three on the roof with your cat, you'll be ready to throw a KY bottle on the screen. It's about a father and son relationship, but you just want two of them just to swap and get. If you always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without money, your wish was granted.
