Van Damme. What else to say? Bill Goldberg. TAM WE GO. Now we know that this movie will be really terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, I knew it would be bad. But I did not even think it would be bad. The story is terrible, Van Damme is still old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are just as good. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie. You do not see it. At all. I would not even be paid to see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - In his heart lies a wonderful action action full of excitement. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but traders would be sure we would think so, would not we?
