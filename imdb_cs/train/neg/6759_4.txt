Another case of a decent DVD case that damages movie quality in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was not that bad. Rochon does the service and damn it! cast is good looking. I have never seen that many people regularly experience muscle problems. This movie really wanted to think Rochon was a killer, but it was not. My biggest problem with this movie was that by the end I did not care much about who was a killer and the real killer did not make sense because it was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought that "ha, betcha did not see that one coming, fool! ". Yeah, there were flaws in continuity (mainly with the ever changing Rochon cabinet), but for indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure that at first it was just a little covert excuse for the girls to go up but it was just a trick. The dialogue was sometimes too thoughtful and painful. <br /> <br /> I do not have too high expectations and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's portal is beautifully underestimated.
