It seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What is it with Will Smith that I can not stop? I think he seems too hellbent by taking them seriously and getting Oscar. I can see what a bias is, but if he does not show any new acting lessons, I can never see him winning. It's a huge name, and is generally confused by being a talented and diverse actor. He just did not. I give him that I tried so hard and that I could cry for a drop of hat. That's about it. Seven pounds for me was a little eyeroller from the beginning. The call to suicide did not affect me in any way. I was not curious to know why she was calling for her suicide. There was no absolute surprise. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent chemistry on the screen. I also do not know my name, but a Hispanic woman has done a great job with the role of a frightened and beaten woman. Woody Harrelson had a very limited time on the screen, but I would say he stole the show whenever he was. Overall, it was just the extreme run of a non-original plot. I could not help wondering why I was interested in any of these people. He never liked "Tim / Ben". Did he kill jellyfish? Was he the only one who survived an 8-hour accident? Geewiz .. did not see any of those arrivals ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is quite generous.
