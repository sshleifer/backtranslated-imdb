Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten and play Sylvester Stallone, which was supposed to be enough, and featuring too many rock climbing scenes, vertigo, fall, and scene-chewing villains and uncomfortable air robbery. There are two plots, both chrome. One involves a traumatic unsuccessful rescue, and the other involves the bad guys who destroyed the plane for prey and killed various harmless people whenever possible. Usually John Lithgow, perhaps suppressed by the horror of the product, diminishes to grin and call those he does not like "Bostid!" in an unclear approach to the English accent. Janine Turner, who was spooky and mysterious when she played Maggie on the North Exposition, is unfortunately lost to the rescue and pilots. Stallone is dense and muscular. They have no helpless lines in this. No live lines.
