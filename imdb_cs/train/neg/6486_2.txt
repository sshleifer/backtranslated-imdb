If there is one thing you can rely on, it's their special ability to take the story and repeat it again. Even watching the ad for Lady and Tramp II was a terrific experience. Disney will destroy one of their most amazing classics at all. She even had the spaghetti mass scene. It's already before! And that's what I say, this apologizes directly to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original film and even some of the really bad films Blutha. Penguins and walnut duo (even forgetting their names) are just a really bad copy of Timon and Pumbay. Morgana is another Ursula. It even repeats practically all of its old lines. Tracks are pathetic, really stupid. I've never heard such bad songs yet. The dialogue is terrible. It's pathetic and simplified. On the side plus, at least have time to make the animation somewhat decent. All the usual characters are not as unpleasant as they used to be (or maybe it's a minus for the Little Mermaid fans). Back to the negative, Melody is so cute that you could vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Marshal favor. Do not waste money on it. True, it's not as bad as the return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it is a bit of consolation.
