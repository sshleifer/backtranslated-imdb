It was first a "cute" movie, then it got too sappy and featured average songs, at best. <br /> <br /> There is too much King James English spoken is not only uncomfortable in today's world but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people trying to listen to this movie today? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines and speaks like "Hank Martin". In addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair, she was also Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise"). <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with the end of a good feeling and I can not knock it. Maybe it's worthy of a rental, a historic jacket, or if you're a big fan of Crosby, but overall it's not that much.
