Following the much clearer "Cleopatra Jones" in 1973, sculptural black actress Tamara Dobson returned to her signature role as a skillful, super-hard agent for narcotics who grabbed a heroin ring here in Hong Kong. Cross-blazing blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at the beginning, but ultimately the flags. The shooting finale is right next to the assembly line and Dobson looks less energetic than she was (she's still sexy and she's spinning at a unique distance in her comic book, but that's too big for her-it's crazy). Stella Stevens plays this kindness this time; She's good, but Shelley Winters can not match her predecessor. ** z ****
