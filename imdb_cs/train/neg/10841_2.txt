It was not all: it was tempo, pop and actors who are not afraid to chew the scenery. She also had a decent screenplay. This one should scratch my head. If Farrah is not really a "serious" career, why does a manager (and why is he losing time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists" why do they register for The Matrix of All Jiggle Shows (like "Brady Bunch," where Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare just to be on BB)? They were not industrial names, but they were not even hungry. And while they got the story right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman's rejecting pitch for "funniest home videos" and "American Idol" and the spelling promises his little girl Tori one day makes a show for her apparently did not happen. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was how spelling is skewed. He is shown as a show-runner and creator when he was not one. And how "come" with the "idea" for CA was laughing! How could Spelling and Goldberg enforce Farrah's oral agreement when others were signed? And why did not Farrah or Bernstein say she did not leave because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because the Majors wanted her? That's why the attempts are trying to create conflict and tension by setting Farrah as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), but it fails because the background has never been laid - that's where the Three Companies have delivered.
