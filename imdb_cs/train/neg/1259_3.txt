Thank you to Hollywood. Still another classical movie that was totally destroyed by a cheap, shallow, spectacular and superfluous remake. The original "Ape Planet" was an intelligent and thoughtful film with a very clear message. It was a film almost entirely focused on a dialogue that sounds very boring, but it was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> It seems that this film, on the contrary, rejected almost all dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour walk-through movie. Dialog has been limited to just minimal, interaction and character development does not exist and most of the time it is extremely difficult to see what is happening. Instead, we get a lot of purposeless action scenes, some marginal one-time lines and some very hollow quasi-syntetic interviews. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the ape is beautiful and the sets and the background are also beautiful. This, however, does not distract from the fact that "The Planet of Monkeys (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic film, filled with paper characters, a stupid dialogue and an almost nonexistent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop destroying great movies by turning them into meaningless burglars. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, the end did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> * from **** stars, especially for visuals <br /> <br />
