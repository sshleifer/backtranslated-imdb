I sat down and watched the film with friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not where she was close enough. I honestly could not say what genre this movie was in watching, and if it was a comedy, humor was totally omitted. This conspiracy did not exist and the acting was terrible. My friends and I have been able to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before turning them off and immediately asking the video store to take it back. I NEVER recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly do not know how this movie lasted more than one day in theaters, and I can not understand why anyone would gladly look at it, considering not only the unimaginable title but also the lack of famous actors / actresses in the actor. This review is no joke and I sincerely think it could be the worst movie ever made. It's the worst movie I've ever had to sit with.
