This is Roger Corman's low budget for horror / creature. DinoCroc originates in manipulation with prehistoric amok genes. The engineering croc first kills one of his own then gets the taste of man and becomes a rapidly growing terror after escape. None of the characters have any depth, but they are not the focal point. We've only gotten a few glimpses of a huge two-sided descendant of dinosaurs and some of the best "killing" scenes in a small budget movie. My favorite scene is of moral character trying to use three legged dogs for bait and becomes croc food alone. There was nothing left on the bridge, but the upper legs of his ankle. Without the real roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and the unpleasant professional crocodile hunter Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed with the enticing Joanna Pacula as a remarkably dreaded doctor, P. DINOCROC, as a piece of cucumber.
