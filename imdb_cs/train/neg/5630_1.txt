The only reason I watched the film until the end was the "hope" that I see something interesting. The movie is really bad, and the performance of the girl is really, really bad, honestly, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but you need common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind when she started talking was: "She has a relationship with Willem Dafoe and he's got to help her with the script and appear in her movie because he's a great director." surprise, surprise the next day after watching a movie I found on the internet that his wife Giada Colagrande. An amazing story and awesome performance.
