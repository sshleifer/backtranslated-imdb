I was dissatisfied with watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is the first fan. This image is right-squeaked! Missing the first spell. You can really understand every word the mice say, the animation is miserable, the palace is very different from the first movie, new characters that have never been mentioned and were horrible, fortunately the prince did not have many lines that kept him from sounding stupid. Basically, it's like a Lion King 1 1/2 except for his various stories that all mice said. The reason I give it 2 out of 10 is that the songs that did not hear the characters were the most enjoyable.
