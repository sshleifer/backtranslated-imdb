It's really a raw parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, humor is cheese, so it's acting. But after all, it's a fine movie that's expected and it does not matter because what you really want is a sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there is hardly anything. You have the feeling that you are watching TV at 3 am and independent movies are playing and the one on it was made by a college child who does not get anywhere in the industry. You are staying for a very long time, waiting for a real sexual scene, many times you think something will happen, and then you just let yourself hang. One (maybe two, or one with two parts) that really goes somewhere is very nice. I personally can not recommend unless you find it in a clean basket for a dollar or two. If you decide for a good plot with a plot and a good actor, you do not want that. If you are looking for a good lesbian movie with a delicate core, you do not want to.
