In Texas, seven friends meet at the bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party. So far, they call the American nightmare a pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost concerns. A serial killer who listens to their beliefs makes their nightmares fulfilled and kills each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a weird, low-budget movie that has a terrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camp as if it were Friday 13th. Then the story moves to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this point on, the story has great potential and unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the script does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for Nurse Jane Toppan's behavior, feeling that the budget was over before filming was completed. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story could be a good low budget film slasher. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
