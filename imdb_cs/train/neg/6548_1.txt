If you are watching this without knowing what this story is about, then you are quite surprised. Even at that time the synopsis painted the picture of a rather sensible plot, but the actual film is something other than. <br /> <br /> As revealed in the report, he tells of a clown mountaineer who you see as a prologue before opening credits and by browsing the text that tells you the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind , that the spell of trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal desires to change their ubiquity. They can see our world and notice all the people of this mountaineering climbing, and synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy and create a smart ball to meet him. What this translated is a recurring animation that a 5-year-old child could produce. Create shapes even though the credit comes in the style of stop motion and moves it into a constantly moving loop. And repeat until your eyes start closing, then move to the next scene. If nothing at all, chonopolists (if there is this term) really love their sticks and balls, they are constantly playing the magic of this magical sphere and playing with them in the field before releasing them into the "other" world. It is not better if one interacts with the ball in another hypnotically boring and sleep-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thanks, of course, because the run time is shorter than what is being advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the listed 70. While firmly dated, its matt colors, a non-existent story, scratchy soundtrack and repeated pictures win over any fans. Do not waste time.
