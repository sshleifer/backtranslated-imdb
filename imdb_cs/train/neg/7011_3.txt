If you do not understand a wasteful surplus, this movie will not mean much to you. An attempt has been made to intercept a little humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. When Salma Hayak makes her big disco number her voice is so obvious that it's pathetic - the producers could at least get someone who would sound distant like hers. The documentary that has recently played on TV is much better and gives a much more accurate view of this period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; nevertheless it does incredible work.
