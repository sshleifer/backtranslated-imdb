Nicole Eggert was renowned as a star, although Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach is a much larger star than she. It's basically a bit of a spin on "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who feels sorry that a stranger is being persecuted by the army, and takes her very sexy disguise into a noble being. A little nudity and partial nudity, unnecessary sex scene are part of the journey. <br /> <br /> The film hits several obvious sets and runs jokes about being photographed. I also liked Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and got a really cool death scene. It was quite clear that Stacey Keach would be taken over and the film had a pretty weak end, it would be nice to show exactly what kind of talent Alien had passed to Eggert.
