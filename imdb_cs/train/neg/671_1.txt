Poor acting, no script, no conspiracy, no convincing murderer, no tension, no original setting, use the same cloakroom / bedman / man behind you in the mirror repeatedly and repeatedly boring and NEGATIVE, and that NOBODY sometimes "really" kills (at least not on the screen), which in turn turns on any kind of tangle that can evoke it directly and makes everyone feel even more cheated to spend money on the ticket ... it's a horror film without any horror LMAO. MOST what you see is what looks like someone who took a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it over a plastic sheet. You have to be a teenager sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring you to have enjoyed or being high / drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have life and do not bother writing reviews that often, if I really hated anything or enjoyed it. > <br /> <br /> But this movie is AWFUL and I feel I have an obligation to warn you to force your Hollywood money and to encourage this kind of movie once again! <br /> <br /> One thing is to rent a "bad" movie in the Weinsteins charts, another when you have to sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> You want some remake of nostalgia, forget it! This is not a remake, nor is it a reconfiguration. It's not frightening or engaging, nor is it satisfactory enough to be "funny" like the others on IMDb said ... it's just outdated and booooring. Here's what you're going to take away from this movie: the memory of Brittany Snow's scar, which is more than a storyline, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST have some sexual affair with JS Cardon of The Forsaken, who won the role of murderer horrible as my poodle and too cute to kill only someone), and that for some reason (duh) anyone who returns to the hotel apartment never returns. What kind of person would not fear the ball when deciding to announce candidates for a king and queen prom and a sharply competing girl will not show up like that? That's my warning for you. Do not lose money like me. "The original" is also crazy, but there is more guilt for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, although it's not as bad as this tweezer (I'm sorry it sounds vulgar or rough, but when you see it, you'll understand why I say what I say).
