This movie was great for the first time I saw him when he was called "lost in translation". But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man who played Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into an excited Latino woman playing Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silences that we have experienced in Translating, we get insignificant madness in 10 items that turn unpleasant. Instead of characters that were thoughtful and introspective, as in translation, we get characters that spread nonsense advice about topics they have no idea about. How can a figure wearing one hundred dollar shirts and never been inside the Target department store expects to give an adviser to a working class girl how to prepare for a job interview as a senior assistant? Do not think it stops. If she does not get the advice, she'll tell her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the film for me was allegedly rushing to meet, and yet the characters are still looking for time to run another job whether to wash the car, stop at Arby, or just put it on the list of its 10 items or fewer lists of things they love and hate. I still wanted to scream at them: "You did not say you had somewhere to be? What the hell is it? A minute ago, you were almost late, now you're eating roasted beef and thinking about your lives!" Until I've seen this movie, I've never really figured out how it could "take on itself", but I think this movie does exactly that and so reluctantly. Dialogue makes the characters cheeky and unsympathetic, except that I apologize for the fact that both actors have signed up for this project.
