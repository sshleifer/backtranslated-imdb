Overall, overpriced and filled with more subplots than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-founder says he wants to combine genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two are mixed like vinegar and oil. To run, the comedy is not very fun and juvenile. Moreover, the film is not really realistic. Freedom is enshrined in the legal system in condemning French citizens against their will and seemingly easy escape from drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on a big-screen home TV, and I found out that the movie was going on. Finally, I finally moved the final long speech of one of the main characters to the son of his ex-lover. At that time, I was worn out by an absurd, confused conspiracy that dealt with a dead lover, a marriage of comfort and a walnut former lover. Sometimes the story moves to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - either Ismael or above all Nora. At the expense of the viewers, opinions are constantly changing from Nora and Ismael, her former mistress being limited to her will in the psychiatric hospital. Probably there are two potentially interesting films, none of which are well developed. The epilogue does not bind to many parcels and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora has somehow found happiness, although given the circumstances in real life, chances are equivalent to the chance of snowball in hell. Actors do the best and attract, but it is not enough to overcome all the bad defects of bad writing, editing and lack of focus.
