And it comes from someone who can handle almost any viewing. Game and sound are terrible. It could qualify for "so bad a good" merit point, for some. However, I will take my horror movies seriously, and it's just crazy - it's just so cheap, I think it's my main complaint. Dialogue is often cheerful - attention how many times you "scared me". The "child" actress is seriously horrible - I pray that her acting career has ended here ... the series "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" is worth watching repeatedly.
