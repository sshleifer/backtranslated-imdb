I'd rather have 20 root canals than re-pass the film. Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, has lost almost two hours of his life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cold. The only fun thing about this disorder is Mr. Samaha, who is uncomfortable and messy about goats and asses. Berkowitz has a great concept and sifting it into the dust. It's jerky and badly done, apparently trying to make it look nervous or funny. Not one. I rarely felt that the movie was a loss of a movie (or tape), but this is difficult for this difference. If the date indicates the view of this movie, run it.
