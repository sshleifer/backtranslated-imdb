This is the disaster that Fellini has been working for all his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and the free assembled bulls is very small, and in which category the movie eventually fits, it will often depend only on your personal feelings. This means that "Casanova" left me in the cold admiration for her sets and a little more that Bukowski can not summarize more adequately: "Casanova also died just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts to say he lived well the truth is to say that I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true, ladies usually go to the biggest fool they find, that's why the human race stands where it does today: we have kept smart and permanent Casanovas, all the cavities inside, like the Easter bunnies that we support for our poor children. "<br /> <br /> If I succeed, it is the position that Fellini occupies on her topic; but it's disgusted. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made up of devastation and incestuous behavior, Fellini's themes in "Satyricon" have been dealt with more. A series of storylines is characteristic of soft porn, without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to distraction. <br /> <br /> Still, Casanova might seem like a crazy fool. And I urge someone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, it seems like a dirty old man-surely a master, but one whose impulses are satisfied more than anyone else. I think it's hard to imagine the audience that likes this movie. It was a story that is not worth saying.
