Vipul Shah has made a really impressive job in the past as a director. "Waqt - The Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were fun and interesting to watch. "Singh Is Kinng" is funny he produced. His latest show as director of "London Dreams" comes as the weakest travel career. "London Dreams" has an average story, it's about how success brings friendship into hatred. You agree, I have the potential, but when you look at "London's dreams", are you wondering what's going on? This movie has perhaps the worst culmination of recent times. Vipul Shah writes Vipul Shah to the director. <br /> <br /> The first lesson is boring, the second is better; but again the top is scary. How can someone forgive a person who decides to destroy you? I will not do it. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask for his pardon's friend forgiving thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he comes to India, rather than slapping or abusing, Salman welcomes him to the baja band and says he's the cause of the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah forced to show Salman's character as GOD? If she did, she completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that you would welcome the man who destroyed you with such a large income? Write down what you feel, do not tell us {audience}, we're smart enough to understand what's good or not. <br /> <br /> It's music, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is terrible. No song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is excellent. The film bears on the shoulders and works in emotional scenes. But again his character is depicted as DEUS, which ultimately looks like a retarder. Ajay is just as good, but Salman totally shadowed him. Asin is unnecessary and what is a great talent in this movie, like Om Puri? Rannvijay hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is okay like a vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream remains a dream!
