"Masters of Horror" turned out to be a bad arena for "episodes of the message", and while a case may be made for "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the season, Joe Dante), most efforts to make it come down like an anvil heavy and not surprising (nothing more than the upper fly immobilizes). And "Pro-Life" simply combines the reaction aspect with ultra-violence; the young angel (Caitlin Wachs) she saw through the forest is almost hit by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaughner) who are just going to work at a local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone cold, far-right holy warrior who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing, "Pro-Life" has accumulated some buzz about his controversial problem, John Carpenter treats the whole business with amazing indifference - it seems that even less interest in the movie than the script itself (which is really poor ); slow stimulation does not create any tension and simply brings an ambling conspiracy to crawl. Even if Dwayne and his sons retreat to the clinic, the guns will light up, it's a stunning accident; Later, when the doctor is tortured with "male miscarriage," the scene comes out of useless and unnecessary - the effort to discard the signed film. A bad performance (Perlman is sadly useless here) is becoming a script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" is the source of his next hot meal. At a time when a spider with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit walks through the corridors, you just have to wonder what he thinks about this mess ...
