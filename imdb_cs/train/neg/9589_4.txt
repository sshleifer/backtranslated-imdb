This movie is terrible when you look at it. It's a perfect movie if you look at color images dancing on the screen - each of them is not obviously associated with another. I chased this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I really appreciate the musicals. In the final, Bowie was a total of ten minutes in the movie and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The morale of the story was really charming. I could not say whether it was racial questions in London in the 1950s or that it was not being sold. In the first half of the movie, I wanted to laugh as it was cheese, but I liked that I did not like it. When blacks were murdered, I thought the tape was back. Maybe I borrow half of two different movies? No, there was the song "Keep Britain White" and the dance sequence. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you could write a musician. Not at least music that could be considered "campy," as I have been several times in this review. Overall, I would say that this movie could do much better if it decided and cast actor better. (And I'll get David Bowie into it for a long curse!) My grade: C-
