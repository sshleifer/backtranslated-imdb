I think I've seen worse movies, but that may be because I'm as desperate as these bad horror films are standard. The killer monster is really really bad, basically it's a man in some green suit. It's a much worse actress when it comes to movie B, but do not think it's been stealthy for a while, no, no. Actually, it had a conspiracy with the essence, but it was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad low-budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, the film absorbs balls, this is just upset. Blood looks really fake in this movie. This is one complaint I have about the whole horror of a new low-gore mill, looking stupid. The well-shuffled death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
