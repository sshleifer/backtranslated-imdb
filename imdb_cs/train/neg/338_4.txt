Surely one of the smallest humorous Eddie Murphy films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, thirty-year-old dragons, and "chosen." Murphy is "chosen" in the question and writes the opening song, is "the best man in the world". Seeking a lost and missing child, a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) tells him that he is "Chosen" and that it is his destiny to find and save the Golden Child. For if a child died, compassion would have died with him because he was the one who was compassionate. If all the hocus pocus garbage for you is not destroyed now, surely one movie starts. Just say that the plot is abominable and destroys the whole movie. They want to be another vehicle for Murphy's egoistic brand of humor (the comedy does not tell you), the film will fail on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can not do much to drive. Very stupid and disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
