Primal Drugs comes from Roger Corman's film legend, and as such, anyone who watches it needs to realize that this is a low-budget B movie and knows that. kill the whole army, do so, believe to keep uranium, but no ..... Contains two Dino with taste for the human body ... Then a Crack call a team that can also be called Delta Force. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not Jurassic Park and Yes Dino are never clearly seen because of course it's a boy in costume that is not very different from Barney Dinosaur - just slightly GOOD scary but come to the boys it was around 1% of Jurassic Park's budget and as such does what he can. <br /> <br /> Do you deserve it at the bottom 100? .... HELL NO !!! I think almost half the voters who give this 1 - WAY WAY is too hard, is much closer to 4 ... it is actually much better than a whole series of other films that are not at the bottom 100, and has a similar production value to production of the Sci-Fi Channel. (again Films that get overly difficult times from IMDb critics) The act is expected in B movie, although none of the actors have taken it seriously, nor is it the scenario. <br /> <br /> All in all is a fun movie B - not for movie snaps <br /> <br /> ** from *****
