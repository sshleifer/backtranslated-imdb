Now I've hired this movie because it was Brad Dourif. He's a great actor, BRILLIANT in all ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how silly this movie was, and he did not care about good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some lines simply refute me. And there are some lines that make no sense, and it seems Tobe Hooper just throws the lines without thinking about the conspiracy. Oh! BTW plot is BAD! But it's one of those movies that's TAHT BAD that it's really PAINFUL watching. I recommend it only to BIG Dourad fans or fans of any of the other actors because this plot is pathetic.
