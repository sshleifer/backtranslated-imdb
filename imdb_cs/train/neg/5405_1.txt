I got it like a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. Effects - Overall, although many of them were in other films, it is clear they had to work hard to behave so badly, so constantly letting the whole movie randomly let some sort of negotiation slip. Plot - be generous I could say that scriptwriters originally started a plot, but they tried to ignore it. the fence collapsed faster than the Chinese knock off the Scrip computer-now it was the abomination of nature. did not happen with any rhyme or reason. most character lines were best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure no character could be considered memorable. I watched other movies where they were extra interesting and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short buses specialized Mode - until you can come up with your own overhead ability to copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make such a failure. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family give you 10 stars for this movie
