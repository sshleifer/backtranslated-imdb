I think the shots and lighting were very bad. When I first watched it, I thought it was an old version (1956). When I actually discovered the real year of the movie, I was shocked. I did not know that such a recent film could be shot so recently. That's really all I wanted to say. But this movie had a good plot, nothing you could not escape if you just read the novel written by George Orwelll. All I really want to say has been told, besides, I can not believe that this film could have received so many awards and nominations. I gave this movie One (terrible) because I felt it was very badly made. That is all. So long
