I have seen this movie recently at the Film Festival. It's the romance of a former alcoholic unemployed who just came out of a big depression and a middle-aged woman working in the labor office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, we take the "social" theme of the film and transform it into a romantic comedy. The actor has done a good job, definitely looking like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working class woman, she looks, acts and speaks very much like a "high-standing" woman. I mean, she plays Ana Belen. It does the same in all of its films. The whole mission-en-scene of the film was very bad. Photography is ugly, it is not used well in the whole panoramic aspect ratio. Dialogue sounds the whole written and boring most of the time. Comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny and are not solved. In my opinion, this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love the previous Pereira movies can you enjoy this little bit. Anyway, I left the theater because I felt I was wasting time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder what the director feels when he sees someone from one of his films, especially one who is pleased with everyone.
