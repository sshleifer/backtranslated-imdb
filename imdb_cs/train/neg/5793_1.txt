It was really bad. Just like the short-lived TV series "Dirty Dozen," played by Ben Murphy and produced at the same time (and cheap in Yugoslavia), I was upset about filmmakers - especially for Telly Savalas. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he did the garbage), and a reviewer drawing the parallels with Telly River in this and John Wayne in the "green beret" almost sums it up. > <br /> The other reviewers pointed out one of the many ridiculous murderers that this celluloid crime contains, so I will not repeat here. But I add that I am amazed that no one has mentioned the absurdly small helmet Savalas is wearing on his big, inflated head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that this murderous film has an IMDb rating of up to 4.7. <br /> <br /> As for me, it's "1" right over the deck. If you want a good example of why franchising to death really is a bad idea (especially 20 or more years after the original) - do not look more than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - Avoid!
