the only word I could think of describing this movie is: Ordinary. The fence line about the character of Gary Sinise, who is attempting to commit suicide, is a ridiculous assumption and c'mon..living like a Salingerist hermit or abandoned in a barrage that managed golf balls into the ocean because he could not handle life in a lucrative golfing community ? tell me the river. I wish it was my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was obviously a poor choice or paid check for Sinise. The scene in which Little Timmy Price magazine has a verbal abuse of a second club member before her father during a tournament is so over the top I'm embarrassed to watch him
