Excessive drama that can not make any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - a big thing. There is some eccentricity between characters and in dialogues and situations, but the kind that is bad for the film, which makes it often seems absurd. Summer Phoenix plays at the head, speaks and acts as a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the film as a late girl who does it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. They told us soon (in that "Barry Lyndon" - as a narrative) that she had learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the film is suffering for it. In essence, she goes like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely credible due to her lack of emotion. Occasionally, the film had a boring, sleepy feeling from Dogma 95. Does it matter? I would not be surprised at all. Phoenix Summer is sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late Phoenix.
