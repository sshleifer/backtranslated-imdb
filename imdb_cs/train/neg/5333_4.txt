An embarrassed, scary mess that represents a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull rider who leaves the rodeo to stay at home in the wilderness of his people in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in a family herd of cattle (which is in direct need of breeding). What director Peter Tewksbury desperately needs is a few narrative skills, though he lacks the ratings he does in complicated comedic arrangements (his social commentary is not exactly sharp, but Tewksbury has his satirical corner, some fun scenes). In spite of the colorful backing from Katy Jurad and Joan Blondell, the generosity comes in the way, and there are too many boys and hollers who are very interested. As for Elvis, he's free and clever all the time - and although it's nice to see he's having fun on the screen, he has to ask if he's given up on the movies at this point. This moaning of the image has a clear sense of what it seems to him, and although the souls are high, the yields are mostly low. * 1/2 from ****
