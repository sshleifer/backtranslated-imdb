It was a really funny movie. Every one in the movie tried to be serious that what made this movie so funny. I mean, go shark head to the human body. It can be more fun. Good work by Sci-Fi keeps comedies coming in. I never thought the movies could slow down. If they keep it, they will have to rename a science channel or a comedy science channel or that. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next 4 of the scifi story. <br /> <br /> I'll be ready with a popcorn bowl and a beer or a bottle of alcohol and I'll be ready to laugh again!
