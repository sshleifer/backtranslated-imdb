The only good thing about "People I Know" is that they serve as a perfect example of films that Al Pacino should not deal with. The first big turn I had was the way Pacino tried to portray the Georgian accent. sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. Dialogue and character interactions were horrible along with a weak conspiracy. Support for the cast was an extremely perfect job while keeping the film interesting, and in an hour I still saw no signs of a solid conspiracy. The whole story is a real piece of work and I had to face my face several times to wake up. <br /> <br /> This movie is sure to be bored ... to avoid at all costs.
