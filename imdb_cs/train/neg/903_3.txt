1937 "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck was not exactly aging - as one would think a semi-updated version of the story would be a really puzzler. Maybe they thought Bette Midler could make some of this, but Barev Midler could think of it, but this horrible scenario would beat her. The story of a female barman who has a child out of wedlock and years later gives a young girl to the rich father of a child so she will have a better life, she can not escape tatty, old-fashioned traps and sentiment. Midler works best with a film director who can control his excesses, but that will not happen here; Stephen Collins is sober as a man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well occupied as Midle's daughter. This is what was called a "female image", a cylinder, but it does not pass, because it remains too faithful to the origins of the thirties. * 1/2 from ****
