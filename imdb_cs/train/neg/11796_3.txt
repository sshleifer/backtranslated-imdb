Is there anything else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. Do not lend them, however, and definitely DO NOT BUY. That would be a big mistake. I watched it on TV, and at some points I laughed. I did not laugh a long time, and I did not laugh. However, there were fine jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you're looking for an extremely fun "hood" movie, then watch Friday. If you're looking for a strong emotional movie (something this movie is trying to do), watch something like that or Jason's Lyric. If you look at some good black "booty," go to the dominique simone porn watch, because nudity in this movie almost does not exist. However, if you have nothing better, and it's on the cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
