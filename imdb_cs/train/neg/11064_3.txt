Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel like I have to say something. I did not want to look for "splatterfest" exactly as someone gives it, or even "blood and intestines / gore". I have some respect for relatives of the victims, even though I really felt that the filmmaker WILL NOT BE. They are without names, without faces and insignificant. It's just a Dahmers sexual rebellion. I've seen this movie with such morbid curiosity that I'm thinking, "What makes a man a serial killer?" as well as thinking about the specifics of the Dahmer story that I know very little about. People seem to think that the film does not have to include the events of the Dahmer story. its history, what happened when they caught it, the consequences, etc., but it's important! You see, I suppose if you are an American, you know it all. Not all of us live in America. To tell the story of a man as he was obviously REQUESTS at least some of the history and real events to be said / proven. This does not mean that it is blood and guts, there are ways to show horrible things in the movie because they are filming implicitly or cleverly without resorting to the gore. He will not even touch some of what he did (I learned more about how he reads user comments on this page!), The film felt like an emptiness. Time at a time with very little essence. I would like to know if the film is about REAL DAHMER, because in its inadequate direction, at a very slow pace, which will NEVER change, a strange depiction of homosexuality and a VERY LOST unfortunate lack of any attempt to end, this film is POH√ÅR. I would not recommend to anyone that they are wasting their time to look at them. Sure 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
