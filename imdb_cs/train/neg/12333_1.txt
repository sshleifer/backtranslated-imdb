Un-bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look in her usual pertune, which normally makes me forgive my shallow, tacky acting schtick. It is hard to believe he is the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide path has a career? Who ... Banzai !!! Was it the one who did Big Chill? It has to be a replica of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
