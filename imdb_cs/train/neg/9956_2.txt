I made a special effort to see this movie and was completely disappointed with the result. On paper, the script seems to be hopeful and the selection of actors leaves one with hope - I liked Pacino in the Wonder of Women and saw Anna Duperrey and Martha Keller in several French and other films of the 1970s and 1980s. But I have forgotten how important there are some partial dialogues in the film and there are absolutely ..... garbage! Filming places were also attractive, but hopeless, demanding and forced dialogs have pulled the whole thing to a level below zero. Besides, I'm quite allergic to the world of automotive races and I will not find any interest in this sport. Even the ineligible dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and it says something!). I really enjoyed watching this movie better and I was very disappointed that I was so disappointed.
