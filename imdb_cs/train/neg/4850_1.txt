Some unreal film spoilers are included. From real life experiences, this film has continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I am currently deployed on a second trip to Iraq as infantry. This film has nothing close to what would happen in real-life events. From the very beginning we need to name some of them: a bomb truck, EOD elements that develop unaccompanied solos, EOD sergeant, wasting with VBC, sleeves all the time going through the ACU, where I had to call him, 2 copies of the dollar haji, the sniper scene . The list will continue, but there is no need to indicate what is going wrong with a time span of 2 minutes before the other things were wrong; and that was done. <br /> <br /> This film is designed for people and critics who have no understanding or experience of deployment or army. <br /> <br /> People with military background or military knowledge will be disappointed with inaccuracies.
