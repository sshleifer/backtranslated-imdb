The only reason why this movie is marked as 1 is that zero is not one of the choices. With a story thinner than the depressing era of cabbage soup, spooky acting and special effects that seem to come from the television series Thunderbirds, it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director who put this black mark on his biography. Even under the 1950 standard, the special effects are cruel, with the exception of several submarine submarine sequences. I can only assume that he has been nominated for the best special effects because with the exception of 20,000 leagues under the sea and THEM! There was no one else to make effects. There certainly was no competition for Disney that year if it were their only competition. I do not intend to recommend a movie, even for lovers of hard submarine film, because the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot, where sea water can be seen, moving up the ascending periscope. There are other, much better, sub-movies that you can enjoy from this era, like the above 20,000 leagues or torpedo runs.
