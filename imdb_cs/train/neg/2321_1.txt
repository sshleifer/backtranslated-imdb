I can not believe that this show still counts 9 out of 10. It has been seen whether these voices are in the first 2 seasons, but what could have somebody who could still value it afterwards? I was a huge fan of the first season. I was addicted - all secrets, tensions, inexplicable events. You never knew what to do next. In the second season, I still paid attention, but I was a bit frustrated that some basic things were not yet explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it seemed like more questions to me. I love tension, but you have to throw people every time to watch them. Now I can not remember what has finally turned me away, but I had enough in the 2nd season. I'm not a great follow-up fan - and you can not miss an episode to keep up with what's happening. So it was no longer difficult for me. <br /> <br /> It's a shame they could not be a little smarter and faithful than loyal fans. I agree with some posters that seem to have caught ABC and decided to see how long they can shoot this show. They do not realize they will eventually lose more fans than they could get.
