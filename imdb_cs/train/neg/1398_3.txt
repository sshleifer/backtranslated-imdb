I bought it (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the name "Gray matter". It was a novelty to see Sherriff Roscoe in a role that is not DukesOfHazzard. As the other reviewers have warned, it is a pretty boring story of a top secret government experiment that has become bad. And yes, there is plenty of shooting, especially the pool house in front of him. Some of the characters and interiors are so indisputable, I think the creators are afraid we might forget who is who, and so we are still dumpping us by first showing the outside of the buildings. It's really funny. After a while, the shot in the pool feels like a TV channel identification badge and reminds us that we are looking at "gray matter". I also enjoyed two name calls. At some point an angry test item jumps to someone who has commissioned them to call him "scientific b! Tch!". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later to another subject release a pair of mumbles about the "scientific b ** tard!". It seemed very unpleasant to me. Sometimes this movie will disappear forever. In the next ten years, it's probably impossible to find a copy of it. It's almost never happened. <br /> <br />
