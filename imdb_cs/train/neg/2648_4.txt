I just read a book about Anita Loos' work, and photos in TCM Magdonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I was watching this movie. I've never heard of the movie, so I had no prejudice at all. I thought Eddy was a cute beginning, and MacDonald as a secretary he did not know he existed. The scene in which she appears on a costume party in her simple, angelic dress with a non-cooperating saint and wings that do not remain is really cute. I was even with the movies when Eddy slept and imagined her as a real angel. But after a while I began to fall apart. Eddy stays "asleep" for the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from here, it does not matter because it only feels like it. The rest was a conspiracy less and unnecessary. I had to force myself to hold on to it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from a musical number to a musical number in some crazy hallucination was just strange. If Eddy "woke up" earlier and the original story went on or really married an angel, I think it would be much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real nature. <br /> <br /> There were not really enough musical numbers that could be called musical. The first songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald did was like nails on the board. Completely wrong for her opera voice. Even Eddy and MacDonald managed to catch up, showing what the real stars are.
