This movie could not decide what it wants to be. There were several parcels that for some time led to the conclusion that these things eventually merged ... but not. If you want a "stranger's story in frosty waste", keep the 1950 version of "The Thing" (not the abomination that has been modified for 20 years in gore-o-vision). <br /> <br /> "Alien" seems to be largely recycled from an INDEPENDENT DAY. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lots of cheerful scenery with a small paycheck.
