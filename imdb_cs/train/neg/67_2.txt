From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and difficult that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook writing scripts will guide you layering characters that include character arcs and a three-act structure. You will not find anything in this movie. The police are bad, and are therefore depicted as shallow, incompetent and cowardly. It does not seem that the creators of this film have become that the police could be honest citizens who consider entry into the police as a good way to contribute to society's welfare. The viewer has no opportunity to deal with his or her mind as to whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with being arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the door of the sanctuary, but he only knows that he is inside for three years, when we heard it much later in a dialogue. This film contains many Sun shots that look at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film as a real effort to watch. It's the direction of modern movies, and that's watching me again.
