This is a good example of how to NEVER shoot a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context of events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless browser; the story is totally impossible to follow and the ideas put forward do not make sense without listening to the director's comments. This film has a lot to do with human attitude and tries to show how bad it is, with the emphasis on child abuse. It includes some traces of real, terrible acts of violence, including the execution of wartime. Though it works in the context of the film, I feel that thoughts behind the film could be introduced without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for a weak stomached or easily offended, and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climactic compared to the rest of the film. If you do not want to hear comments when it happens, you probably will miss it. The director's comment was one-time, "sit down that guy and let him talk, no cuts." comment. While it's not necessarily bad, the director ends up massively and often spends minutes while complaining about his college, film conditions, co-workers, bad film and a dozen other things. Permanent negativism aggravates what else is an essential tool for understanding the film. The film was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 films for four years with an exceptionally low budget. For this reason, video and audio quality is poor. This in itself does not mean that it's a bad movie, but makes the bad movie worse.
