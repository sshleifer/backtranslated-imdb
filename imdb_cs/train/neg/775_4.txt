John Candy. Do we need to say more? That's the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how gifted he was as an actor. Be aware that he moves from poor slob to horny blockbuster. Simple (soft) face change and we go out. There are many great bits in this movie and many really stupid bits. The best moment for me is the KUNG FU U scene, as well as the great moment when John (in the trance) performs on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how he and his sex organs love his girlfriend. I'm sure you can read it, maybe you think this sequence sounds really harsh. That's it, but it's also very funny mainly because it's done by John Candy. The story in general is quite lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV graduates with Candy) are not far enough to be in the movie. Levy has his moments, especially the filming of the wedding at the end (thinks of Rod Serling) and a great scene when he talks with his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you had a hard day and you need to give your brain a stupidity. I give this 4 out of 10.
