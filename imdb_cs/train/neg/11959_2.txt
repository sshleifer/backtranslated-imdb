This film is the twisted nonsense of a film that is in Japan about a dysfunctional family that ends up with a strange violent guest who sits and watches four family members in their worst. There is nothing sacred about this film, sexual drugs, and violence is so limited that I am surprised to get past the censors. Overall, I think it will be just for those who should not be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message that others would consider. A film that is subject to the worst element in society and is in any case a complete scream ... Disappointment from the man who created the noble Dead or Alive and Audition movies.
