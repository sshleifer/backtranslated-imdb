'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. Every festival is disappointed and this is one that could not live in a very lengthy logical line: "Thai lesbians fighting monsters". Rather it is the story of the Khmer country, her grandmother taught her a little witchcraft along with some special (but specific) rules: "you do not come under the linen", "do not eat raw meat" and "do not take money for your strengths." Well, guess what she's doing, the girl moves to Bangkok to get some money like a "bar-girl" and breaks all the rules her grandmother has taught her, which then releases the evil spirit that comfortably kills "foreign John" services. <br /> <br /> While this film can not even be released in Thailand due to its controversial themes, most American audiences will find this horrific cruiser between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire" as instructed by Walt Disney. If not for several scenes with a significant amount of blood MPAA would probably be worth it for teens only. An adult TV channel is literally broadcast, although you would expect at least a sexual scene considering the fact that the film is a brothel and one of the actresses is in fact a Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> As for the "lesbian" angle, there is one short pitch and a couple "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are actually a couple (on a brother). And the P-bar must be the only exotic dance club on the planet where girls hold their sarongs and make carnival pieces (there's a fencer who manages cucumbers from the girl's mouth ... ooh, fake pictures). <br /> <br /> No nudity, no real monsters (unless you count five feet of tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way an adult ever paid to see this kind of stupidity except for the DVD. You were warned!
