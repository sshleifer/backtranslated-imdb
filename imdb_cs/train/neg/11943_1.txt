The landscape is pretty and the dog is cute. In addition, this film has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is as brilliant as usual, but the script is so terrible that he even gets up bad. The curve does not make sense, the dialogue is stupid and there are many minor errors. But the dog is cute ...
