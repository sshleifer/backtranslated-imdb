I do not know what's about this film - director Sam Mraovich somehow confused about every little aspect in this movie. Normally I would say that it is a movie that should not exist, but this film may be the most important of all time. This film should exist only to be undoubtedly the "Worst Movie Ever Made". I've seen bad movies in my life, but it somehow breaks what I thought was wrong about something much harder to imagine. Everything in this movie is funny, but the most funny thing is that Mraovich himself considers it a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
