The reason why the bad movie is so bad is that it's so badly written, and that's the fault of Robert James Waller, a native of Bridges of Madison County. Writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trut and the dialogue is wooden and unlikely. The disappointed couple - a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history they are ashamed of - are being overthrown by a strong, self-controlled criminal and after several adventures (predominantly threateningly violent) alternating with the scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, leaving a half- a killer who is as bad as he is, sees it brighter than anyone before. Nothing can help this film, neither Scott Glenn's slammer's face as a killer nor the enticing Latin of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and even the courageous performance of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist to track the killer down. Serious waste of time.
