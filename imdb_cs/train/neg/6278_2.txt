You have to wonder how some fictions are sometimes made ... this man has chosen to omit why among many other things and just stretches across the border. <br /> <br /> And yet you have a lot of decent actors who do everything in their power to get into the story. The blue throat in the whole film is "over again", which in itself will be depressing, but this is exaggerated. The notion that it is not a state of health, not a house or a gypsy or trinket of a curse, but only something that, for some obvious reason, begins to do our protagonist and then everyone else around it simply ends up resembling an empty mug. Some doppelgangers have super power, but others do not, or do not know they are doing? They seem to be as crazy as we do. <br /> <br /> He is a furious man who has lost the "Invasion of Body Hijackers" with Keifer Sutherland's "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense". You'll crush the three of them seriously.
