Nicolas Roeg? He directed a classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW, right? Magnificently, the aforementioned film was broadcast on BBC television during the weekend, when the COLD HEAVEN evening projection does not favor what happened. <br /> <br /> You see that it's impossible to compare COLD NEBE with DON`T LOOK NOW because both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third COLD HEAVEN I thought they had the same plot except the dead man was replaced instead of a dead child, in fact my mind was deployed on this film, which turns around the pitiful widow seen by her late husband running around Venice wearing red jackets. It does not occur, but about one third of the way at the time of the run has a massive twist, and despite being a crucial plot, it is not explained in any great depth. In fact, there is very little explanation in COLD HEAVEN, which destroys the film <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the poor COLD HEAVEN production values ​​and it is impossible to miss them. If I was not different, I thought this was TVM, because it's for the TV that it's right on the white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg is also trying to inject artistic house creations using spoken thought processes, but it will not help the film again. One can not feel the feeling that Roeg should make every effort into twists and turns that are completely flat on the screen. Cost-effective production, uninterested directing and really bizarre assumptions and scenarios cause bad film
