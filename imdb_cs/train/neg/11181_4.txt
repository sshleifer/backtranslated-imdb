The film is about two stories: one is the political murder of a girls call, the other a higher class political party. The transition is the public relationship played by Al Paccino, as he witnesses crime and instigator of the evening. If the scenario is terrible without any decent dialogue, and controlling the meaning of the track, Alho's performance is unforgettable: how many people can be as persuasive as a strong and dreaded man (like the Godfather) as here as a little servant (see also "Donnie Brasco "). /> <br /> In fact, a big young lion becomes tired old. This crawling of ages is very moving because it does to viewers who ask themselves to become older. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up because he can get back his energy on the church scene. > <br /> Maybe it's a good thing the movie is so terrible that it puts the lights on the talent of Alu!
