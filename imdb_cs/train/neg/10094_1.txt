Mother Sister and I are self-styled horror film enthusiasts. We've seen almost everything, especially zombies. Now we have seen lots of good zombie movies and many bad ones. This BY FAR is the movie I've ever seen all my life. Not only was this terrible, but the special effects, graphics, and sometimes the "zombie" makeup was the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadow around the eyes) That is absolute proof that you should never judge a book. Because the film envelope is the only sweet thing. do yourself a favor and DO NOT USE THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so scary about this movie that I went so far that I stuck a note on the inside of the film before returning to the movie that says "This movie is upset, do not waste time, do not come back now" hahahhaa I do not want anybody else who would lose a good movie night on this POS movie! nor do I know how it got the rating that it did, it should be negative
