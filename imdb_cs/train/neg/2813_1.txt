Usually I would never borrow such a movie because you know it will be bad only when looking at the box. I rented seven films at one time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6, and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found that the video camera gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, acting is bad and action makes no sense. It's hard to write a good overview because I have no idea what the movie really is. You have more questions than answers at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the 'Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1 PS I would like the correct Corinthian review (right below my). He says Robert Englund pulls out his underwear, rides naked, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, who played Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
