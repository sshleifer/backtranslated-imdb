Tom Wolfe's diverse, brilliantly-watched satirical novel about the lives between the snows in New York gets a glossy look here, but it is not good. The film does not suffer only by thinking of Tom Hanks as a tiring Yuppie, Kewpie's doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As a darling of the Lithuanian New York. The most serious miskasting was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could breathe life into these unbeatable characters and make them interesting, but Brian De Palma never paid attention to the nuances of human experience for all his visual sophistication. The resulting film looks good, but it seems to be the subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if satire does not worsen the viewer, what's the point?
