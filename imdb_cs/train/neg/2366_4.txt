I'm a Nightmare series fan, but this one is terrible. Deaths are so trendy. If you look 20 years later, the whole nintendo scene is obsolete. I liked flashbacks. I think they should have a preliminary control when he's still alive. That would be more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
