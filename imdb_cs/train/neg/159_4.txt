I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life, as well as her talent as an actor. That's why I felt strange to her that she would appear in a movie that distorted these facts. The rescue of her figure from the South Pole was carried out by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, which flew through Canadian construction and built the Twin Otter. The trip was rejected by the US Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard beyond their capabilities. The same company, after several years later, brought the rescue from the South Pole pool. I feel that the film really represents a very fascinating subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a terrible task. I do not understand why the producers felt it necessary to ignore the rescue pilots' bravery and show a rescue aircraft like Hercules USAF.
