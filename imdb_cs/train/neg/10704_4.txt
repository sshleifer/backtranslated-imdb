It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when the ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's just one policeman Jack (Crackerjack) to stop it. B-action movie, which he borrows from other films and is quite good with good action, funny plot (as always in these films) and three stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like silly B-action movies, it's not for you.
