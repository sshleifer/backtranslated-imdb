As a big fan of gorilla films I generally assumed that this would be great - and in terms of gorilla effects, but they were pretty good - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story, but in fact it does not even get close to what has actually happened to the "Buddy" -which in real life was the famous Gargantu, sold to Ringling's poets by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known to many enthusiasts animals as a woman who, in the best interest, did not have the welfare of her animals. As for Buddy's aggression, it was all fiction, and she never liked gorilla in real life. a friend actually escaped his wooden crate (not a plush cage room in the movie) during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz to sell him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoo - he was abandoned in a wooden box, deep in the back of the garage for some time with a single bulb for comfort and then sold the circus - where he really lived a better life, peanuts until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla, incidentally, by the way) before the show in Miami. Also note in the movie Buddy is aging, but chimpanzees never get older. (By the way, chimpanzees have not grown together with other animals, including Buddy as shown in the film)
