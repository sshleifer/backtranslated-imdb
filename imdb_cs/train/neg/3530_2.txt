When Ritchie first embarked on the film scene, his films were considered fun, funny, well-oriented and original. If one could compare the hype that he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal contempt made by his last two voyages, would you have to consider - that Ritchie had learned? Is he really so talented? Does he really have original ideas? Or is it just a smart and egoistic director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantin, and Leon, all turned into one colossal and unorganized heap? After watching the Revolver, could one be justified because he thought it would go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and intricate ideas? The revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and brief, trying to be intelligent psychoanalysis, trying to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie is making a huge effort to meet all of these many goals and invests a great deal of script into existential considerations and numerous hangouts. However, in the end, it all serves to create a very heterogeneous, unstructured, and ultimately hostile film. Her plagiarism is so sinful and unlikely that even though Ritchie at least tries to put his own spin, he should be punished because he even attempted to pass it on as his own job. So what the viewers will eventually get is a terrible scenario intertwined with many demanding oneliners and clumsy boring instruments. The revolver is ultimately a non-original and neat film that has stolen a myriad of masterpieces such as Fight Club, Usual Suspects, and Pulp Fiction. His goal is high, but inevitable, the shots are empty. <br /> <br /> The revolver deserves to be nasty, it's really a poor movie that masquerades as a masterpiece of the puzzle. However, it falls flat on its fake face and simply fails in everything it wants to be and reach.
