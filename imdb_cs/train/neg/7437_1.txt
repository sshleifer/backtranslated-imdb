This movie simply does not cost money or money. A full clich√© and a plot that makes no sense! I do not think so many people gave this terrible movie and 10. I think they are the filmmakers stoog. <br /> <br /> If I could nullify the movie, it would be. It is a shame that IMDb does not allow this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I followed him because I went with a friend he really wanted to see. What's sad that I've never had great expectations from this movie, and yet I felt a little changed. Take a word, do not lose $ 8 on this waste. The only fun I got out of the movie was the name of the directors. In all, very uncommon!
