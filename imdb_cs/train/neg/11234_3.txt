This movie is bad to get out well on Friday, 13th. The film is about a murder named Bernie, who kills people around the camp camp. It kills people, because the training camp camp camp is on the land owned by his father, and when the police came to power to take his father's land, he accidentally killed his mother (the next F13th take off). Intro sees Bernie killing his first victim. Then we are introduced to a family we are camping in the same forest, soon after they arrive, they are connected with a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he is locked in the back of his caravan after he broke him from the psychic institute. He sets Bernie to the family so they can take their own stuff, and then they're persecuted. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended only to those who enjoy Slashers B grade 80.
