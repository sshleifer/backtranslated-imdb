I'm not alone in admiring the first movie Superman, a movie Richard Donner executed. I'm not alone in the ruin of Richard Superstar Superman 2 ... which brings us to Richard Donner's film of the same movie, unfortunately this is still an absolute abomination. Superman's world is one where suspension in strong doses is a mistrust, but Superman 2 expands things too far. It does not matter who controls Superman 2 because the script offended the intelligence of the first grader. In a sense there is no plot, because the characters have zero motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, the Superman's power (or its lack) is solved in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this movie ... Perhaps the slapstick in Lester's version is more suitable for the moronic script on which this film is based. Super-Duper bad.
