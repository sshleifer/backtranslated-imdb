I went to see this movie with little expectation, but I hope I will be amazed to see my town on the film. Unfortunately, it's all I have. The story concerns a familiar territory (a meeting at college), but the plot is intricate and the supernatural element adds little to this well-worn topic. Although the quality of acting was good overall, the film's content was terrifying. The sexism of the film was obvious - women are obviously unfulfilled if they are not married, procreating or both (although it was formulated as a post-feminist choice). Worse still was racism - a pitiful Jewish mother, a black man still living at home - and unreasonable cruelty (the suffering of a class geek). We should be ashamed if these figures were to be considered Kalamazoo's inhabitants, and writers should be concerned that they had such widespread and cruel stereotypes on the screen.
