Quentin Crisp once said that when things turned out to be too beautiful, it was romantic. When things are unexpectedly gloomy, they are realistic. And when something gets irony, they're in place. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa it falls into the second category. This director apparently tried too much to make a Spanish film "Ken Loach" without being able to capture comedy and warmth among the characters that uplift Loach movies just because they are "depressing." Los Lunes al Sol, it's just depressing. Things are unrealistically gloomy. Those signs of the final moments of poverty reach the climax at the same point, and if the story of the stomach is not enough, Aranoa launches the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. These films were unreasonably re-evaluated in Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weaker citizens of society, in this case the unemployed port workers, does not automatically create a good film, even though I would be the first to feel the lives of these people. This movie only managed to amplify the lack of interest in my destiny. In Spain, in the 21st century, unemployed people do not live like beggars and public transport boats have decent toilets, and it is difficult to meet a bar with so few players and such little happiness as they appear. Leon de Aranoa apparently has no idea of ​​the working class of Spain, and no favors are given to him. Pronunciation is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which the men watch a football match for free was directly copied from a movie that is much more realistic about the theme of the "poverty" trap, namely "Purely Belter," which is much more fun, funnier, yet sad.
