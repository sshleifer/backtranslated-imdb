He just saw this movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed. The film basically says that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, are coming to this country, bringing with them all those who can, with the old country, attacking and accepting what the Americans are working on. Which is a very bad way to look at immigration and a much worse way of telling people. That's the main thing. Another thing that overall production, directing and filming is at the level of village amateurs. The actors did quite well, but they did not save a lot of crap. Several jokes were funny, but most of them were bad and cheesy. I could not wait to get out of the theater, I want the money back.
