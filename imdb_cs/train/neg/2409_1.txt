It was a painful experience, the whole story is there so I can not get it, but the acting was terrible, there is also the part at the beginning when the scientist's brother goes to work that she actually wore a white coat at home before I went to work, that working with biologically hazardous material means you should have sterile clothes in a controlled environment and the lab looks like a school lab where this monitor is at the top of a cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene just so the place looks technically and the scientist has in fact, breakfast in the lab, and beside him the biohazard is marked glasses and his boss enters him and he does not say anything about it ... not to say bad behavior very bad can not get any worse than my advice do not follow and I thought nothing was not worse than the house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll films look like classic Shakespeare compared to this one!
