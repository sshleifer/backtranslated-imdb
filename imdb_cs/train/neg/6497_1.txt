I really had a great chance of going to this film, so I took what he got with the grain of salt and hoped the best. About 1/3 of the film I just had to give up, it's just a movie that happens without an obvious reason, and it's all disconnected. I like movies that think you, but this movie was just a lot of thoughts that were knocked together and never really connected. Do not think it's David Lynch-esquire, because some would believe it is nowhere else than in the sphere, except for some explosions. Let's say it's artistic to mask the fact that there are no obvious plot or story is just a way to justify why you lost 1.5 hours in the movie. The game was good, but it can not save the lack of a story. I agree with one post that was previously published ... "It's like having some other people in the head ... while they're on drugs," in other words, nothing makes sense.
