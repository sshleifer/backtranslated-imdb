Best of the best 4 is better than 3, but hardly. Basically, because part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (like 3), (ie, there is no reference to Tommy Lee, who has siblings). Anyway, I liked the story of the Russian story line and especially the part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. In addition, though a few combat scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane inflatable scene). Also, Part 4 is not really moral or says anything like Part 3, there were a couple (Hudson, Thorsen) in Part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). Unfortunately, it seems, the best of the best is Rhee show and to be true, he can not shoot. <br /> <br /> Sand on tape, Rating: 4
