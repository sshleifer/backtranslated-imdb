The next time you are at the party and someone asks: "The next day I heard the phrase" the will of the author. "Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them to sit "Head over water". The only way Diaz could survive this film was through this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However, the film is not the smallest logical analysis. Why Keitel binds Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind her? Why, of course, he can do a chain saw. For me, the best part of this film was that I saw him on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars in a video rental shop.
