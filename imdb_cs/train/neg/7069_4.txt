When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and soon became Blockbuster. But honestly, the movie is a ridiculous watch with land that celebrates the loser. The film has a Tag-line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", meaning Love is sweet, but the sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the film's hero (Ganesh) sacrifices his love to the main lady (Pooja Gandhi), even though they both loved it! His justification is the meaning of the brand. This film influenced so many young broken hearts that he considered this attitude of a "loser-like prison" very thoughtful, and therefore became an iconic film when he was able to continue his life. Ganesh performs in the movie Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. In fact, it looks funny in the song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) to look stylish and cool. Its appearance does not help even the leading role. His hairstyle is poorly performed in most of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are horrible and very inconsistent in the movie. <br /> <br /> A good part of the film is excellent cinematography and brilliant music from Man Murthy, which are actually the real saviors of the film. Also, Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are very well written. Director Yograj Bhat must be praised with a sentient view of the songs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all-in-all except songs, the movie is very common !!!!!!
