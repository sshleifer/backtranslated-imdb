It's almost like two movies - one literate and engaging, the other stupid and a clich√©. It's really shame that all the problems have not been solved by writing, but because of how fast most of the B movies have been written and produced, it's not unusual. But it is a real shame because it could be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First good. The film is original and includes WWII code triggers. It is quite fascinating and I liked watching the lead man (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a major code-breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the movie were very good. But now for the bad, the film just went too long and lost the pair for about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of John Rogers as a "quaint girlfriend" must be considered one of the worst written and distracting roles in the history of the movie! For each intelligent motion made by Bowman, idiot Rogers then stepped in to do it as a bad "comic relief". If her role was intelligently written, the overall movie would greatly improve! Instead, watching it, it's hard to understand how we actually won the Second World War!
