Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Come to it: It's a nasty piece of rotting roadkill with a cow sh * t on it. It's just a horrible movie. It is a city-wolf-like film with the worst imaginable imagery and story as weak as any gang bloke of the 80's. Even worse, the poor Kane Hodder was brought into play by a gigantic evil werewolf. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career ... Anyway, the former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf. It's a little drunk police drama with the worst werewolf in the world. But they have moments of almost uncontrolled nudity. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is a generally ugly black blur around the screen. And when we're privileged enough to really see the transformation sequence, we've got something that reminds us of a full-featured video from a video game created in the early stages of Playstation. The first Playstation. CG animation is really primitive. Only for the horror of fans who want to see little moments of nudity surrounded by turbulent visual twists. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
