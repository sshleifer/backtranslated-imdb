Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll digging into nuts in Hollywood after the Dome Dead's face strike. If anything proves how much Boll is the main manipulator. After Artisan was knocked out of business on the flop, which was House of the Dead, it can be assumed that Normally Credible Lion's Gate Films was issued by AITD only on the basis of contractual obligations following the acquisition of Artisan property. Since AITD is an even greater example of a complete lack of coherent ability to create a movie, renders exposure and simply steals badly from other films because it should look great instead of because it was in the movie. <br /> <br /> But then that's the reason, right? Boll is not trying to create a coherent film because he is not trying to direct Alone in the Dark. Just trying to manipulate Hollywood. In Darkness, such as the House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne, and 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or "produced." <br /> <br /> These are not movies to be targeted but investment portfolios. Each of them got into production on the pretext that the Boll's tax law and its investors abuse it can be closed within another 2-3 years. The more bombs that can be released within this timeframe, the more money that he and his investors can get. Why bothering to make a good movie when a bad movie is giving you a mint anyway? The result is films like Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> In the darkness, just like all his other films, they are just a cynical exhaustion of the current trend of the Hollywood lenoch film. <br /> <br /> And those who support Boll by telling him misunderstanding or another Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a person a cult figure, you just make it easier for you to get investors but give them the renown. br /> <br /> For more information, visit: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid = 21699 As a party, just do not ask how it gets into your cast. If the actors in the investment fraud do not act, this secret must still be revealed.
