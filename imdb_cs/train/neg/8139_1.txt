Or maybe it is what it looks like. By the way, "The Bat People" is about as flat as a carpet, gentle like a bag of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as the three of them together. (Moss) when he and his wife (McAndrew) take a look at the cave as a result of looking at him (Moss) and then turning into a bat, but not like a bat that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victim in sight first person cameras .... But then there's the job of Sheriff (Pataki), who is probably the worst Sheriff: Hick the kind. He's having trouble with people, he's marrying married women, stealing haberdashery handbags (FIEND!), He smokes one of those cigarette holders in his mouth while talking, so he looks like he looks like Buford T. Justice "Smokey and Bandit "and (it's the worst part) ... IS THE MOST BIG CHARACTER IN THE FULL FILM! The whole film is just a television movie about movies, a week-like crapola (Guano, in this case). It's AIP because it screams aloud! What did you expect it to be an Oscar caliber? And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? And what ... no stars for "The Bat People", full version or version MST3K! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the movie is a sequel, I bury my TV.
