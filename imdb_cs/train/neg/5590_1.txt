A horrible film. An old fragile painter hanging around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the moves in her part and has some of the worst lines in the movie. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film and we believe he looks "Good for sixty". The game is bad, just like the story. The characters are horrible, just like the story. It's really hard to feel for someone in this movie, except for Larry Ewashen who plays the guy in the porn theater that throws on Tatuma, it's a bit funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum like me - so I first rented it - please do not see this movie. That's really bad, and you'll be wondering if maybe PAPER'S MOON is a siding. It was not because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS that it is well known that they can act well, but do not borrow this movie. And if you're a Burton fan, borrow something when it looks good and not fossil.
