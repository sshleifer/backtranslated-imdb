Oh, my. I decided to go to the cinemas with some friends who want to watch one of those mild, receptive Christmas movies, and I'm disgusted. The movie failed. Dot. Paul Giamatti, who I consider to be a good actor, played his character and broke terribly, along with Vince Vaughn, who was always my personal favorite. He's trying to turn the Christmas movie into a new style. Something bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be very bad. The first ten minutes was not too bad, but when we saw Santa, it ended. It was nothing better, the rate remained the same, there was no character development and definitely it was one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Do not look at anything you do.
