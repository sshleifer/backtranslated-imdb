1941 Columbia was a full-fledged studio and produced a film with the same technical shine as MGM, Paramount or Warners. That's the best thing to say about "Adam's Four Sons", a lead-soap opera with almost vague performances by Ingrid Bergman (for the first time in American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a French woman (that was a time when Hollywood thought one foreign accent is as good as another) to be hired as a governess to the four Baxter sons and to stay (with one crash caused by the crash on the stock exchange in 1907) adult men serving in the First World cylinders. Just about everybody in the movie is so kind that it's a relief when Susan Hayward comes into the middle like a viciousness? she is the only traceable person in the movie, though clearly directed by Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is it also the first in its long line of alcoholic roles? but the scenario remains sugar and the end is totally absurd. It is no wonder that Bergman has rejected a similarly rendered "Valley of Decision" for four years.
