And a few "no" to it. Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly does it do? Tell the story? Obviously not; as has been emphasized, most of them are just barely legal boys who sort themselves. Could it be an attempt at subversive homoerotism? Perhaps, if not because it never ends the most harmless and impatient forms of male contact. (Which is a delight to anyone, he repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's a horror movie; is it trying to scare us? No, if the director did not mean it, it does it perfectly and emphatically "work". Never in my life I enjoyed less film. This is the most inappropriate thing I've ever seen. It's like a voodoo academy of horror genres, zombies and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, and then runs them over a coffee filter - instead of being a kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, it's sort of sorting out everything that's life important, nervous or in any way interesting. The result is 74 minutes of movies that are just as exciting as a glass of warm water - just not having the chance to rehydrate you after a 10-day gin veil that will inevitably touch you if you follow this abomination of human effort.
