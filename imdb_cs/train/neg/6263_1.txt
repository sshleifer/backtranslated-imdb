Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a spoiled piece of sludge from Troma. This is a juvenile, prominent and stupid low-budget horror movie about some teenage girls who spend a weekend at the headquarters. Professor's evil assistant forces girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments. Using a brain implant, she transforms her victims and their dates into a zombie. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheese gore, not to mention the laugh musical score. is scary and the script is totally inconsistent. Why is such a piece of crap that is widely spread is behind me. Avoid it as an epidemic.1 of 10.
