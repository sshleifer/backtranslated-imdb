Who makes fun of this? There was too much in this movie that was hard to spend. From the moment Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unwittingly wants his father to come to London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) just to leave him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that someone who has ever gone through London Heathrow knows that such a fête would not be able to tear, and especially not Indian. But the film's problems do not end here, it's the question of the two chief executives (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) going as stellar rocks to the brink of reaching their dreams. I mean, we have seen success come to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK has reached her dreams after 50 years), but it was a rare case. It was really hard to stop my distrust because I felt that the revelation of Salman and Ajay was simply misconceived. Never should Madhuri Dixita and Sridevi play the same role, why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men under 40) who are desperately trying to try their 20s? We do not even talk about the most confident actress on the screen today, Asine. It's her second film (which I've seen), and she's just hopeless as an actress, so she realizes she looks like she just cares about looking good and confusing for the camera rather than good acting performance. It's hard to believe that she rejects all the other film roles so the star in this flute and then she's so fluffy as an actress about nothing to write about at home. And to the top of all, the film just boringly attracted. It's nothing special, believe me, that you are predicting every cliché thing that happens in it.
