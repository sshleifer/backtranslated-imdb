Mann shoots Alberty Rocky Mountains brilliantly and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give a nice performance, as they seem to always do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - Mountie tells the people of Dawson City, Yukon to vote for the Marshal (yes Marshal!) and enforce the law itself, then the shooters fight it in the streets of conquering the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing like this remotely resembled what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the golden rush of Klondike. Mr. Mann and the company apparently mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, Canadian North for the American Wild West. Canadian audiences are ready for the Reefer Madness type of pleasant dangling with this ridiculous plot or, shed head.
