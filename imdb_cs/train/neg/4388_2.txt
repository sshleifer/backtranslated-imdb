Oh, man, I know what you think: "I can not go wrong with that name!" Uh yes you can. I also loved the title, but one hated a silly child who played a "helper of Satan", I hated both mom and sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all those people! Man, sometimes he was watching. The INSURED reason why it does not get 1/10 is an insignificant budget, they've done well. But oh, the man hated the actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be bad, I think they saved a lot of money by using it for a Halloween mask man and ending really stupid at the end. Oh, agony, do not look!
