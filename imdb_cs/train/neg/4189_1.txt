I had a significant misfortune that I managed to catch up with the two worst 2004 films this morning: first the incoherent emptiness The Chronicles of Riddick, which CGI drove, and then a tough, vain project known as Greendale. One price multimillion dollars and another price penny, but both are bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> From the front I should say that I am not the biggest fan of Neil Young in the world, but he contributed his share of classical melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young Compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man wrote really great songs. Unfortunately, in Greendale there are no great songs and expensive few good and the film around them is a really sad and simplistic political slogan. Absolutely without merit as art and insignificant as polemical, Greendale is best forgotten. Buy a book if you feel compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.
