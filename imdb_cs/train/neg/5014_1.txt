The film has the longest, most terrifying and agonized end of any movie I've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the initial credits. January Jones gives such a wooden performance, I was surprised she did not get into the flames as she approached the candles in the movie. I really do not recall it from the other films she has made (the blessing I have to believe.) I never criticize the actors, because there are too many things in the movie that can affect it, but in this case it's so bad that the fact excels from the ATROCIOUS scenario.Because she gave the lines and the situation Meryl Streep would have trouble with, but I swear that she read from the card card off the set Otherwise I thought she could actually learn disabled or slow some That's really bad, but there is still no excuse for this performance, nor for the director who would let him do it, I'm sorry for the other actors. a little Indian / breakfast club stuck in a spoiled burrito then regurgitated by a school principal-writer-director. Take it back, it has Studio exec crayola everywhere.
