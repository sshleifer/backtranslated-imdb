I have rarely been subjected to such utter nonsense in a film that should be based on a historical character. The horrible joke of the movie was galloping. Terrible, distorted, distorted and intertwined with direct lies and half truths. Famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally a consultant for this film. The script was, however, historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and he also demanded that they stop using their name as a source (in embarrassment they thought people thought they were involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows that Hitler defeated his dog. There is no source for it. Hitler loved animals over humans. He brought the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banning vivisection and animal experiments. He was also a vegetarian. The film shoots the acquisition of the Iron Cross into a farce that includes bribery. Utter lies. He has been awarded for repeated acts of bravery for a long time. There are no historical documents that would indicate that Hitler had ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Neither. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hitler is portrayed as a frantic simple in this trash. If he was even half ignorant, demented and dense when he was in this nonsense movie, like in real life, you would not even know he ever existed. I think to become the leader of Germany. Frankly, this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> Watch Downfall and make it a very wide place.
