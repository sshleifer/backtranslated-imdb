It has to be the most captivating TV show in the air. This is probably a getaway for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother has exhausted all the talent of a younger brother. I hope this show will be canceled and will never be talked about, except for negative use. Jim must retire or something. Please let them go by air. If I saw a joke from the show, I'll go and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I think the devil is just taken over before I look at the full half-hour of this programming. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deeply that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. Not anymore, please.
