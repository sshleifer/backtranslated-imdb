I've read some good reviews on this album for "Mr. Scarface," but for anyone who does not like the genre of Italian gangster films like me, the picture will probably make little sense. Indeed, after the initial set-up, which included ten million frauds, the picture was converted into a relatively routine vengeance with a slight step in the identity of the character Ricc (Al Cliver). The entire gang warfare conspired me with Vincent Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other commentators have commented, it is the only one who made this film any life with its often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's buddies who chased Tony down the streets did not actually experience Tony even putting his hand on them. His whole status as the title character, Jack Palance was unnecessarily missed in the anti-climatic closeness of the final, so the US working title, "Mr. Scarface," is rather strange. I have seen a lot of spaghetti of the West to know that everyone does not work; I do not think that in this case, even the first glance at the sponge gangster did not do.
