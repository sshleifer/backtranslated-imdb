"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing she could do after disappointing the fifth film. It started from the beginning. Sure, this "final" movie in the saga is stupid, but at least original. Some visuals are even a bit of a breath. And the story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zane), who returns to the city to face her evil father, is unique. Overall, the film is nothing more than a different cartoon to get children into the theater. He has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look stupid and go through like a sheep ready for defeat. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end it's nothing but a fucking kid's fun. <br /> <br />
