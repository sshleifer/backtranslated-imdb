I had no knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded fine and I wanted to see a really digging Viking film for a moment ... Unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I hoped it would be best, but instead was given a boring Nordic soap opera that seemed too long after 84 minutes of running. The premise of the film is so interesting: it's a Viking warrior who defies his god, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of a war-dog named Barek to death and rebirth as a berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live an enraged, insane and violent life throughout his life. The film is filmed comfortably, with rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by actors, but once again I was bored and questioned if this dribble finished. Movie players had the opportunity to do something rather fun and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could be improved by some cheap exploitative tactics, such as blatant nudity and lots of gore ... I mean, we're talking about berserkers here, are not we? The Vikings had to be pretty bad with all the rape and corruption, so Berserker would not be extreme yet? Overall, if you are not a fan of The Young and Restless (etc.), Or you are a really crazy Berserker who likes suicide, I would probably avoid this unruly celluloid.
