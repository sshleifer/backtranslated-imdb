This is the only movie I've ever seen that has encouraged me to write criticism on any website, and that's a significant statement from someone who likes "The Monolith Monsters Attack". This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a fearless film. He does not have sex and violence, for example. I believe this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to entertain, question or instigate. Adults could easily get to sleep before watching television as children watch this movie. Do not be surprised, however, if you appear when children find out that the TV has switched off and started a board game. As a grown-up adult who has everything from mundane to fantastic in realism, drama, comedy, and action, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate imagination, this film has nothing to offer.
