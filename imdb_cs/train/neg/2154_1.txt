Allow me to confess. I found this video used and bought because Guttenberg looked so sexy in the underwear on the jacket. But there was another story inside. In addition to the fact that the film was basically a parody of the special effects of "invisible human" (highly visible strings and other similar accessories), the script lost no chance - in fact it receded - to offend all non-WASP races and indeed-or-imagined homosexuals. Every insult to the person in the script was either homophobic or racist, or both. It starts with a nervous grid, along with restless sound, camera-style photography, and a melodramatic story. However, the end is a bit of a surprise. But when you get there, you barely care less. It's a shame that it can be a good movie.
