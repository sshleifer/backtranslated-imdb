This movie was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it could not get worse, they added more joints and more pink cars with fuzzy trimming with clumsy sexual scenes. As you can guess, I was a victim of the original version. We were deceived when we realized it was Supervan, a host box that promised lasars, breaks in jail, and much more. Who would have thought the Christmas gift Dollar Store could be so fun!
