Warning: Contains spoilers. If the movie starts with a sex scene, it's a bad movie. (see eg 300). This is confirmed by the aforementioned hem. The second scene represents the headquarters of the event. The fact that we know the end makes the film boring. Even more land appears, because the story is repeated several times. And it got worse. In order to compensate for the subsequent lack of tension, we learn more and more about how the characters are unbalanced. And yes, they have a lot of them. Andy (P. Hoffman) is for example an addict, more? Cheating on his wife, more?, Plans to rob his father, more ?, his wife cheats with his brother, more? he does not regret his mother's mother's co-mother, more, is he a serial killer, more? etc etc there is not enough room to write here ... I wonder how he could have a top job. And why did not his wife leave. On the other hand, I like the performance of actor Hoffman. Even here PSH will save what is left of my $ 7 spent on this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it makes no sense, why should I take care of the contemptuous characters? Another broken lemma is that the film should have a sympathetic (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> It's also a lot of sentimentality, for example, to take care of the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents' life before the crime.
