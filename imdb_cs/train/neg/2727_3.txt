This special feature in the new collection of DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not really have to be included because it's in the movie in less than 30 minutes. But what he does is shine when he's on the screen. The movie near the plot is just an excuse to show some players of Warner's day contracts. The JANCIE rule shows a promise and it is a shame that it has not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN manages the role of "go-getra" with aplomb. Better if it was in color. The areas of Travis Air with some rear design work well. What is best in the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you liked LOCKS YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you'll like it.
