An interesting change from the first. it was more the secret of this film than the first. Even when it comes to what happened, who was a murderer. There are some good parts in the movie, the first half starts slowly and then rises in the last half of the pace. The whole movie is nice. The story is 22 years after the events that occurred in the first movie, Norman Bates is out of the asylum and back to Bates, but when a woman appears to claim to be his real mother, mistakes will be made. Perkins plays again at the age of Norman Well and the scene was great at the end, and he was angry.
