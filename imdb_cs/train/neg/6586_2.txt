If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, do not worry about Gawi. The film barely deserves mention besides A-leaf work like Ringu, The Story of Two Nurses, Cure and Ju-On (or even such good material as Eye or Inner Senses). These films are overwhelmed by fine details, unexpected images, rich characters, and certainly non-western to accept what is terrifying. Gawi is stuck with the rest of the bodies and authorities all that has caused the American horror to be dirty in the last twenty-five years. The movie tries to combine the story of the Asian spirit and the Hollywood film slasher, but it's badly fit. One aesthetics is obliged to spend the other; guess what? They had no own story telling filmmakers that Ringu is producing an underwater evil, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©, bullshit, insignificant plot, boring ghost, noise.
