that's what you would get if you let the 10-year-old (manic american) write the story of a monthly trip. Absolute garbage without redeemable properties Maybe it has some fascination in the 3D department. but like a narrative and fun animation it did not do anything that would lose an hour and a half for it. Save your time and money and watch instead BOLT <br /> <br /> Damn. Lack of rows, but I have the feeling that it summarizes ... well, I agree with the above list - it's like a story of Cold War propaganda. Perhaps it would be more interesting if the underwater moon landings appeared on the fly, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why did all the major hits deform? - No one has full compliments of limbs!
