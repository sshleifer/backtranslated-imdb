I watched a lot of cartoons or animated movies because I have a girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to find out if I wanted my little girl looking ... and not. At first I thought it was such a cute movie as Bambi, but it was as if it were gay. Information about him said he enjoyed it because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It looks like it's a movie that's made for kids to learn to be gay. She was also very sad with her father and everyone. I do not know, I think if you're gay, you'd like it, but I do not think I'm looking at my little girl again.
