"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It's a movie loved by mothers, grandmothers and women who are going to cinema every five years. Like a zombie movie it blows. There is no gathering corpse in the eyes, and it's terribly light in the gore. On the other hand, "Zombie 3" is large and very generous with blood splatter on massive bodies, so it's better than "Gone With The Wind". It is also not overestimated. Most reviewers are not cheated that it's garbage. But it is not boring waste. After the terrorist steals the virus, it drops when the helicopter is haunted, and the chemicals penetrate the ground. The terrorist who was exposed to the harmful mixture is hiding in the hotel room, where he slowly transforms himself into a zombie who eats meat. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. As soon as she bites her, Lucik Fulci's hell mark is released. As usual, when Fulci is filming, acting is unfortunate, the plot is covered with holes, and the gore is abundant. It turned out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so he explains his rather schizophrenic nature. It is also badly shot, poorly tuned, and sound is flat. Still, she is saved by her merry adherence to the most beautiful murders and impatient stimulation. It's definitely worth it if you're undead. Or he does not like "Gone With The Wind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
