It was obvious that this film was designed to appeal to the audience Chick Flick, to whom I had little to do and enjoyed. However, it was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become another Meg Ryan (who became annoying as hell in his own right). Her acting was exaggerated and seemed to be excessive in comparison to colleagues who were released in their roles. This movie could have been more, because there was a good budget for setup, actors and decent story lines. My wife and I agreed that in the end it was "Muck" because the movie ended with painful pain! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham keeps the type of movies she belongs to, like hell.
