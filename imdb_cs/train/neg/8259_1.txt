I noticed this movie back when she appeared. It was based on the idea that autistic children could communicate with written news and someone else helped them and led their hands. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly these kids, many of whom did not even see the keyboard or screen when writing messages (in some cases they could look at the ceiling), but their moderators were eyes glued to the keyboard began to write abuse reports from their parents and other persons, sending parents and childcare facilities in proberbial tizzy, left and right. This whole thing was proven to be a mistake when a third person presented a folder, opened it to a child and said, "Write the picture you see" after the lecturer changed the folder to the moderator, the folds would fall and reveal another different picture. <br /> <br /> The child could see the dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Every time, every time of bloom, the name of the picture you wrote was what the moderator watched, never what the baby was shown. So who did the writing? Never a child. <br /> <br /> This film was another disastrous turn, as the poster in Australia said, that the person who bothered the child was in a situation where the child is trying to help. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert never sent her son to this place, he would not be spoiled, that's what the movie says. It would be better if he was under his supervision. When I take my child to your organization for help and instead get pregnant, do you think I'm going to want to listen to everything you have to say after that? Unlikely! I think it's a sure bet that all these accusations that these children write, on which this film was based, have never reported anyone in their operation as it happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I recall that the film did a very good performance by Gilbert as an autistic mother, but other than that, the film did not really do much. The worst off was the baby writing at the end of Patty Duke and we hear a mechanical voice that reads what he wrote. . . . . "We won!" This baby was poisoned. If you cut off my leg and I take you to the yard and you are found guilty of harming me, you are attacking anything, then it is legal justice, but it does not return your leg back. <br /> <br /> Best, in my condition, I will see it as a hollow victory. Whether this child had what is perceived as normal with autism is further damaged by harassment. <br /> <b> <br /> <br /> <b> The "normal" child has so much trouble with this experience. <br /> <br /> It's totally superficial when you think you have to look at any situation and go "win" if that person is guilty of court. <br /> <br /> Only bad handling of circumstances and circumstances all around.
