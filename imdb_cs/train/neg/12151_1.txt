that's probably the worst acting I've ever seen in the movie ... at all. and what is happening with the casting. the front lady in this movie has some kind of nose stratification and it's almost impossible to look at any time without attaching it to the nose. you can go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified, better-looking potential heads of ladies. I made an unfortunate mistake in renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film seems to be just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical school. I would like to spend an hour, or so, that this movie was watching public television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this movie
