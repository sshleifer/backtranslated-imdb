Maverick cop with family problems and love to use his weapon? Control! An isolated place with a valuable object asking for stealing? Control! Tasty looking for interest in love? Control! A varied band of silly cartoon cannon fodder with raving European accents? Control! A German sounding a bad guy who played an English actor with a piece of interview for every occasion? Control! Corny one inserts ?? Check it out, does this movie take a pony or what? Clich√©s are thick and fast as avalanche and most of them just look at how bad the script is! In the fearlessly cheap and merry straight out of Die Hard video (above with some crossed lines), we have all the usual action moves that clichs are gradually knocking when we go along with some good old-fashioned violence and the nudity we are going to wake up for someone in the audience to wake up , Jack Wild is a full-fledged cop in John McClane's regime, who even manages the time for the old bad guy to use his weapon at one point. <br /> <br /> In the middle of this mess there are several well-known faces that I can only assume they need cash and / or just play laughs directly from an immense introductory scene that has nothing to do with the plot the ultimate unlikely conclusion accompanied by an interview cableways and even the rocky effect of cts. Looking at these three pieces of supermarket efforts that are developing on IMDb, I am surprised to find that this bagpiper has not formed one but two sequels, I have to find these gems on DVD! It looks like the first sequel is the Breaking Under Siege 2 and the second sequel but he knows well! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack varies with each movie and it seems that even the name of his character will change in the third installment. Still blind purchases of cheap DVDs just will not be the same if the studio did not keep clinging material of this terrible quality!
