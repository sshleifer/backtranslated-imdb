It seems Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: some of them are a very thin thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of them trying to explore relationships between the main characters. Both things were tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film can not hold things together because of bad, superficial scripting, bad behavior and too dark and too boring cinematography. I would say that Salvatores did the best in other genres and in other environments where he could freely look at the characters without having to think about the plot. Overall, a B-movie that is a little worth your money ... Voting: 4/10
