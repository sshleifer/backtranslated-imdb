An apparent attack on Microsoft, which people apparently do not understand intellectual property or market economies in general. The loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious cartoon of gates and is a cartoon corporate villain who orders murders to the right and left. While Microsoft may sometimes engage in anticompetitive activity, it is unlikely that it actually kills people. So the film is high and ridiculous from the start. The "deeper" point clearly means that large innovative technologies should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most of the most important innovations would never have been developed if they were not provided for intellectual incentives for market incentives (and rewards). One thing is to be against anti-competitive behavior - - it's common sense. It is completely different, which is in contrast to market competition, which is what represents the mantra of the film ("knowledge belongs to mankind"). Another example of Hollywood, which is completely out of touch with reality.
