Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval time travelers, was really funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but it was more. It was an unexpected twist, a funny situation and, of course, a simple absurdity that reminded you a little of Louis de Funes. This sequel has the same character, the same actors for the most part and the same travel over time. The conspiracy changes a bit, because the characters are now considered to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history without paying attention to the fact that the film is becoming more and more absurd. The duke, Jean Reno, is trying to keep the whole thing together with his acting, but his character has been emptied, so he can not work a lot on rescuing the movie. <br /> <br /> Now the Duke's slave / helper really has a lot of attention. The film is about him alone and his clumsy, unpleasant, stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. The fact is; this character tries to produce laughter from the audience but fails. It's like having someone tell you a really bad joke, you already know, but he insists on adding this joke to the end and adding details to make your suffering longer. <br /> <br /> You like Les Visiteurs, you do not have to spoil your mouth taste with a sequel. If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you would never see a sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I guess you still have to see lots of movies.
