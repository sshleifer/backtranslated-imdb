This movie was ridiculous right now. Not that it does not redeem aspects? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful scenery background. Anyone who does not live on the East Coast should know that the South does not have beautiful mountains like the ones in the West. I knew it was Utah from the bat, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress the English accent, so they had to justify it as a southern city. The pressure of his accent on the south was easier. Sure, the movie has a conspiracy, but its fake sense of place was something I could not get. It's not like Utah did not have a laboratory lab ... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend to be in the south is behind me. <br /> <br /> One more thing in action pictures is always confused. Why do they always make a "tap" sound effect when the character pulls an automatic gun? It seemed that every other sound effect in this movie was "chuk-chich" meaning that 9mm was loaded and ready to shoot. Of course, weapons already had circles, so it was useless. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics was a CEST over the top. But hey, this movie was focused on a certain "market segment", I suppose ... It's bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie was lame.
