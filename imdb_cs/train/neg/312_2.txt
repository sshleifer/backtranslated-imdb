If you've ever seen this movie, you knew it! If you do not know and want to see the classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie because it is one of the worst. So if you're really bored, you'll rent it. If you want to know what it is, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some models of Ms Universe and five other people. Adam does not like the way one passenger gets all the kids, and he's trying to take on funny jokes. BUT DO YOU! It's getting worse! You'll have to borrow the film yourself to find out how bad it is.
