Cheap story and acting. No good line or line that is bad enough to be a good and unforgettable delivery. Even the flashing disc that was part of the DVD showed how actors are awkward and how little fun one has. The esoteric and occult bases were apathy non-authentic and the antagonists did not become scary or believable. Homoerotic subtexts were unnecessarily tame and unhappy, and were limited to young boys who caressed their chests, while in the boxers they were paralyzed. I'm not homosexual enough to realize this, but some action could at least keep me and my girlfriend up.
