This film is by no means humorous, attempting to be funny with his lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the film is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film, I was thinking of one thing, "when is it over?". One thing you have to give them is that they have very little fun moments, which is why I gave them two stars. It is neoriginal and exhausts almost every old blonde in the book, even those that were not fun for the first time. It's basically a movie that helps to overcome blondes and record the whole repeat of blonde jokes. To sum it all up, this movie is blond humor, which is bad, it is not worth paying no money to watch, it's so bad.
