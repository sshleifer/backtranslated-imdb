This movie was made for television, so with that in mind, I will not get it as hard as it would be a feature film. The script is sub-par, but it succeeds in being slightly humorous in places, whether it be or not. Actor is predominantly overtaking, but that's true for many lower budget movies. The aspect of this film that I really hated was that 90-95% of it is filmed, but in random places it will be 5 to 10 seconds when shooting takes a video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less lively and the shot is clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 movies per second. I'm not sure if these scenes might have been shot later, and at that time they did not have the money to shoot the film (I suppose that's why it's so) but it's disorienting and actually making the film look like a contrast than it had to look. Anyway, I definitely saw worse movies, but I certainly would not say I liked this movie and I do not recommend anyone to see it.
