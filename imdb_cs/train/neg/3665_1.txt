Apparently this happens when the director allows his 14-year-old nephew to transcribe the dialogue on a set while committing alcohol; as I have already said, although I always wanted to capture one of the paintings of werewolf Paul Naschy, these atrocities served as my introduction, and as badly as it is, I still intend to pursue further records in the series, albeit very gradually. Despite some obvious disappointments like Joe Dante's THE HOWLING (1981), I like photos of werewolves in general, but honestly, I quickly lost interest in the "plot" of this film and just stood looking at my TV screen by counting its absurdities. There were too many to mention, but I have to say two who considered me to be the particularly cheerful schizophrenic nature of a wolf man (ie, from a furious animal in one shot to a shabby, zombie-like state in another - as if he were occasional midnight walks in the nature and sporting a completely different wardrobe to hang ... and yes, I knew the reasons for doing so in advance), like the "Phantom Of The Opera" look Wolfstein's character! But what I have to know - perhaps the elusive whole version of this mess could be a very good horror classic!
