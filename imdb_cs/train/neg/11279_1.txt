Words can not really describe how this movie is bad. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least it had some nice shots and a good, good chin that was smooth and smooth to keep you from swinging. That's just ridiculous! Terrible script, bad direction, terrible acting, and you know what? I can not think of a single thing that she might think of otherwise except that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of fun, book with your dentist and work with some root way - much more fun and much better for your money (assuming you need it!). By the way, to complete this report, I need to enter 10 lines of text - please do not buy this music. IT'S SCARY!
