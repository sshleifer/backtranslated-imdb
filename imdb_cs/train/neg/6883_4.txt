I was Puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this "document". At first I was offended that Mrs Perez compared Senor Campos and Che Guevara. Just a fact, sir. John Leguzaimo is not from the Puertorican descent. Parents came from Colombia. Who has not been too precise in this area? I feel that the future of our race rests on education. This message should be shone throughout the movie. Education is a way to freedom and power. I think that this production team should be focused in the future. In my opinion, this film was conducive to anti-American sentiment.
