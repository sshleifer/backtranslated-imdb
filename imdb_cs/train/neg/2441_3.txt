I thought "Intensive care" was very bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's somewhat exciting, but never wrong. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> Fun lies in absurd moments. But always the classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and killed by a murderer. It lies in the corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks "Poor Peter, will I get you a band?". This film was filmed in Dutch and English. To save costs, all license plates are USA and the news background is the Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and you are looking at the original version in Dutch.
