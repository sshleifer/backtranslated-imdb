It's so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say they really try to polish, but we all know you can not. Writing is so obvious and easy, it is sad to see how it tries to sell. Humor and stimulation are so demanding that it's hard to believe that any of these good actors have signed up for it. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that we're hard on the screen. We just need to know where this train is going. But that's just because we caught them on television. If we really paid for this, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So he gets 2 stars for being at least fun / fascinating wrong. And random music (unlike the experiment - too hard indie soundtrack) ridiculously recalls the episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
