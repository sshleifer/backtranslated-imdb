But this movie was boring. Part of the story was fine, but the musical part was not. Not one song I was interested in, and no soundtrack was heard. If Sweet Jesus was going to be comic, it never works. If John Adams were unpleasant and uncomfortable, the rest they tried to overthrow him in every scene. Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie. The historical quote and debate about slavery in their historical context was quite interesting, but was not enough to overcome the lack of music in the musical work. You should not rock songs on the musical, except for a few chirping, nothing else is breathing.
