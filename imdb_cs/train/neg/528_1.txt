I never expect the film adaptation to be too strict to follow the novel (especially beloved as an evening), but when I saw that the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive filmmaker, I thought it would be a good adaptation in the evening. <br /> <br /> If you like a book, do not worry about this movie. It's so far from the book that they both have a similarity. <br /> <br /> Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housekeeper's son. Buddy is drunk, loves Ann and / or Harris. I do not think the only person got out of the book on the screen; oh, it gets worse every moment. And we really did not know from the Bridges of Madison County that we were out of the story we wanted to be enchanted by, on the scenes of our heroes, "adult children who have unpleasant and teenage fighting simply do not work on the movie?" It's a disaster.
