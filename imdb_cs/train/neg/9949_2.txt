This movie could be much better by overwriting the script. Not that I expect a lot of plausibility in movies, but you think homeless people and town dwellers Jack Mason will ask why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And when he arrives at the hunting grounds, the poor Ice-T plays his role as if he actually led these men into forests he had never seen before. And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle? I suppose this film was based on Richard Connel's story "The Most Secure Game". A few years ago, I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after reading the story. Again, I shot the film, cut out all the absurd scenes and all the absurdity. It finally ended 43 minutes.
