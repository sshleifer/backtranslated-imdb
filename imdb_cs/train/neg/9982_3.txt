The story begins slowly and nothing happens for a moment. All the action is eventually, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is fun, but because the story is pathetic. The most fun is when Harvey 'I'm not a paranoia' Keitel really loses and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
