Painting by story numbers and average acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really amazing and deeply felt. It effectively depicts the gentle transition of the girl into adulthood and is very sensitive and inventive about the cultural conflict that concerns the main family experiences. Unfortunately, this key of good film is imprisoned in a purposeless and immense complex plot that can incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict in road construction, the sexual life of secondary and tertiary characters, a mysterious person living in the forest, plenty of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, complications about the local politics of the Church and beyond and beyond. And it does not even include a true central plot that concerns only the hope, the dreams, and the frustration of two girls (and their entire families) in turning their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that the whole thing was going to happen during one summer (and that so many films were attained in 1.5 hours!) Eventually the film is melodramatic, each site point is predictable, there will be fundamental changes in life and then it is forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are very unpleasant. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a terrible crime (in a completely predictable "twist"), and then completely forgiven, and the whole incident has since been forgotten. Similarly, the secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and provide another "twist". It's all totally mechanical, to the end that neatly connects all the free ends (and not all, just those the film thinks you care about).
