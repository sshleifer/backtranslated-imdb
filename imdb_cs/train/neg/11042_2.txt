I wish I could say that this show is unusual in banality, but it is usual in every way. He has a silly husband, his smarter but boring and conventional wife, along with an idiot assistant for "comical" relief - Real predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from laziness, convince this harmful psychological narcotics, which is an unnecessarily non-imaginative conspiracy to leave me either physically ill, or in deep sleep resembling induced coma. But it could be for some time, because it gives the average American a person they can really identify. "Right" guy just like you and me. I live in the southern USA, so this show is just the opposite leak for me. Here's an unpleasant figure everywhere, in some form or in another. Seeing him on TV is brutal oversold.
