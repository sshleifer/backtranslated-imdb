If the title is not supposed to be a spoiler for the transformation of a wife (supporters have destroyed it for us). Anyway, if this movie was not Made-For-TV, it was supposed to be, it's a remarkably low budget, underdimensional, unsuccessful, and throws clich√©s every 70 years, in addition to a disco. Nobody likes you, and you could be carefree about what happens to someone in this. Eminently forgetful except bad, bad performances.
