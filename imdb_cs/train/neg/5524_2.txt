I did not like this movie for many reasons. During the first ten minutes of the movie, I was very disillusioned and concluded that if the movie was saved, at least for me it would have to pull out of the huge hole it dug. Unfortunately it did not happen. Two film drawings for me were seen by Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know about Lindsey Lohan's work that she's interested in what brought the movie. Then I felt disappointing for all three, although in each of their performances there were "moments". I imagine that each of them to find his "moments" was a very challenging task, given the amazing lack of character development and inspirational dialogue. Although interesting, the film is generally so badly written, controlled and edited that anyone who is acting would suffer and be corrupted. An irresponsible way of dealing with sexual abuse and the insidious and insidious view of a small town in America is, in my opinion, two main reasons why this film failed in its mark. As one reviewer remarked and I would agree, the film is almost impossible on the market due to its finished form. I suspect or at least hope (for the actor as well), there are some real gems on the floor of the cutting plant. Sad for us, but if that's true, actors can enjoy comfort and feel a little good when they lend their talent and time to such a flop. Yeah yeah, and one more thing ... I just wanted to see an American movie that included a sadly disappeared but amazingly bucolic setting like the one in this movie where the main characters were not absentmindedly and / party with pop cans, broken CDs and other such garbage!
