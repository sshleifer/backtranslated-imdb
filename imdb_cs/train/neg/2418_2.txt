The first mistake you make in a movie title is to use "live dead" without actually having a real FX zombie budget. Sure, it was a low zombie budget - a really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was not too bad considering the above, and it featured an interesting twist of the zombie genre. If you are going to get "R" for violence, you could also give us good shots of how infected children are. Women were so little used in this film that they could almost be considered "homosexual interest". And I stay out of Oakland. It was a hell of a lot of gunfire and they did not see any cops!
