"Drawing Restraint 9" is a kind of movie that either loves or hates; luckily or not, I left a strong sense of unnecessary time and was thoroughly filled with "killing whales is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film could be enjoyable, especially its first half, until it is clear that each of the actions illustrated serves as an allegory of various aspects of whaling. By then, it might be a little fun to look at the everyday work of Japanese laborers, but later it becomes clear that everything that appears on the screen is propaganda, and no single picture is an exception. I use the word "propaganda," because the film uses a basically old device of moral play, where "good" and "bad" are not used during the action but are in the stones. Probably it's just me, but this kind of art is shallow and bent, though it's all about a nobleman (without sarcasm) trying to protect the environment. In my opinion, it is a cardinal sin when the film material is pulled out without any justification, just because of the expansion. In my opinion, "Drawing 9" could be easy within 75 minutes, but it has an agonizing length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but it was not enough to be without notice for 15 minutes without a stop. The film has no standard scenario and there is no evolution of characters, but it is not a document, it is more of a conceptual installation. This is an unusual form for a movie, but it can still be considered art, even though the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also think the director should have been honest and did not pretend that it could be delivered in less than 135 minutes. And yes, the musical score mostly resembled the sounds of whales. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
