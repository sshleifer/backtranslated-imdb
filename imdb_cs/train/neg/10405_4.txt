The fourth film "Tremors" dates back to 1889. "Legend begins" in the small town "Perfection", which was then "Rebellion, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by terrible "Graboids". Some characters in today's Tremors have ancestors in the past, both figural and literal. The most obvious is the still returning Michael Gross (like Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is incapable of firearms; so we hire the gunman Billy Drago (as a "black hand" Kelly) to shoot them with some "Dirt Dragons". This takes a habit - as it happens in a distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original movie "Graboids". These Tamer Dirt Dragons are just as terrified as their "Tremors" (1990) counterparts. Subsequently, in this film, the characters spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not happen in the original movie. And it was strange that citizens would be so quick to leave when Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why is she so helpless? Why Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) immediately gathered people who fought without Gross? Disappointment. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.
