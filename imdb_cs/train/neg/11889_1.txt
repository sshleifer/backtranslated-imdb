Very fun to watch "Island Beretta" as a kind of natural trashfilm. It's like a response to b-movie type Jess Frank. The builders will pull back (! Face to face!) To the pushers. Very very stupid blow! : incredibly badly targeted shooting (scene) looks even better than hand in hand. Chasing scenes ridiculous. Save beauty scenes incredibly stupid. Erotic scenes are very unerotic. The main luck of the film is beautiful landscapes and festival scenes. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger is a joke at the beginning of the film and the list of Franco Columbu is related at the end. Special attraction: naked bosom.Almoust forgot - Franco can sing!
