The Hazing is a confused mumbo-jumbo that wants to be so hard to be The Evil Dead, which even references Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is, he's just not in the same league as this amazing movie. This film is far from original. That land was previously used by Kevin Tenney at demons night and it was much more fun. This lesson loses too much time with complicated expositions before children get into the creepy manor and start demonic events. Brad Dourif, as usual, is not given the power to be here, but when he is on the screen he puts on another top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As far as the behavior of children is concerned, it is acceptable, but in no way good. Restless work with the camera is much more unpleasant than smart or atmospheric. There are several good moments when the first person gets obsessed and throws around one deadly one lining when sending his victim, but it has never been scary. The gore level is medium-low, but the director will try to make up for it by showing several topless actresses several times. Overall, it's okay if you have 87 minutes for garbage.
