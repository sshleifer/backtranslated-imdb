If this film wanted to discourage people from the drug, it would fail. I was ready to start using them, I waited for something to happen and nothing really was. This film is neither horror nor drama. It's just a paranoia of Meth users. This movie can get a price using the word "F" so many times and so unnecessarily. It was not clear, but I felt they were doing Meth to replace Meth. Hector was getting worse and more paranoid as the movie went on, and the girl just got up. The end really did not make sense. It made no sense for the film to show how unpleasant it was to be in the middle of nothing in the house with a head. I relied on the second feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating of this movie should be much lower.
