This 1973 remake of Billy Wilder's classic "Double Indemnity," is a textbook example of how to destroy a great screenplay. This TV-grade B feed also illustrates the silly remakes in general. While Hollywood went to greedy executives who bleached black and white movies and tried to reject responsibility for widescreen movies appearing in pan-and-scan versions, the industry ignored the hackers who insist on classic film and reduce it with a dirty remake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Billy-Wilder-Raymond-Chandler's work was shortened by half an hour to get the final movie into the specified timeframe with advertising space. Then, refresh your production with colorless photos, smart, upscale sets and TV actors. Thus, the brand new "double compensation" eliminates atmospheric black and white film and novel cinematography, which improves the mood and characteristics of the original. They were dusty, shady, claustrophobic sets that explained the desire of the protagonists to escape their situation at all costs. It's a close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis. The appearance of Jack Smight's "double indemnity" is more of a "dynasty" than a movie noir. Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer where he will die, and Neff's comfortable cushion would be hard to afford an insurance salesman's salary, not to mention the sporty convertible of the Mercedes he manages. None of the characters have any apparent motive for murder for $ 200,000. If not money, maybe a murder for love or desire? Not in this version. Richard Crenna has little interest in Samantha Eggara, and their kisses are as clever as between a brother and a sister. Crenna can not capture Neph's cynicism, and his attempts to double the entender and sexual suggestions fall terribly flat. Eggar is a bit better and lacks sensuality and depth that suggests the internal functioning of the allegedly malignant and manipulative mind. Only Lee J. Cobb manages excellent performance as Keyes. Director Jack Smight and his three directors have all done a much better job. There was no reasonable reason for this poor remake not to be possible, except we should fill in the broadcast time. There is no reason why this crazy child could resurrect the DVD and wrap it with the original film, except to fill the double disc. The only lesson that can be learned from this outage is that even a great script and great dialogue can be destroyed by bad casting, flawless direction, and the value of television signal production. The Double Compensation of 1973 should be called "10% Compensation" because its viewing merely underlines the 100% perfection of the original film.
