Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (The backbone of England.) Killed in the first scene - that's true, people; this show has no spine! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Ol 'colonel of cricket from the First War and now emblazoned master of the estate. Joanna Lumley as ensored lady from Manor, 20 years younger than Colonel and 20 years old for her own but still charming (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy on the side. It's okay, they have the full knowledge and approval of Col. Cricket (they even come "on Christmas!") Still, she remembered the Colonel enough to tell her that the toy has its age (what it is!) <br /> David McCallum, as a toy boy said as well as unnecessarily charming as his squeeze. Pilcher could not come up with any cover for him in the story, so she gave him a deaf work on Circus. And finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, the reverend director of the Church of the Reverend Girls, offers tea in her office with a touch of deep and dizzying advice for living in the outside world just before graduation. Her best advice: "I was once in Nancherrow once, I thought it was very beautiful, but it probably is not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. And Susan - it was time, your character should take the whole show. They do not describe them anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with occupations and settings like this, you have the re-figures of "Brideshead Revisited," right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional supportive roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs is (YOU name another!) The first warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around her by shooting out - "Hey, it's just sunlight!" Second Warning Sign: The Headmaster laughs a lot. When she does not cry, her eyes are damp. This is the law of romantic novels: Leading Lady is "shameless eyes". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Still, I will give Emily Mortimer the reflection in my eyes (wonder if they use contacts?) And finally, the fourth warning signal: not on the screen the female figure is "lady" It's either "miss" or "lady . " When all was said and done, I still could not tell you who is following who and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. Summary: All of them live in World War II without ever having to. <br /> <br /> OK, at the end, LL will find out that she has lost her parents to Japanese prison camps and the child returns home catatonic. Meanwhile (there is always "so far") a young guy who, with excitement (when I do not know), comes home from a war place and lives on Lady of the Manor Street if she finds her there.) Both war misfortunes are dragged to recover in Nancherrow (sometimes they have to be "decided on" in these Romanesque stories). Great drama.
