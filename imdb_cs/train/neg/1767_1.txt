you can ask why? the characters clamored, screamed and chewed the scenery for no perceptible reason except for someone who wanted to shoot a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is the right one, is forgotten as a cop / stolen husband / loving father of a cute little blonde. the story seems to have been cut and stuck in scenes that have been cast out of adventure films over the past three years. ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that apparently sucks energy from every scene in which it is. her real gaming is shown when she takes a blouse away while taking care of films from one limp chase scene to another. Unfortunately, directors rarely go bad enough to be a camp or parody. it's all just clich√©s that are known in every respect. the director shot his own daughter as an early brother probably because no decent agent would allow the client to ruin his career by being in such a chubby, meaningful and uninteresting film. the only robbery is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time.
