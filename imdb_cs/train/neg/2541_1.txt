I have never seen the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a much better film than this or the sequel to the 1980s, as if it were not, how these two terrible sequels were even justified. This movie really had a good lead when they advertised to show up on one of those old independent stations that are past. In any case, it seemed like a pretty good scary movie. But it was a movie that would make some Walt Disney films dark. This film was really just a pile of bright fluff with virtually no rich brook brook. The only real observation is near the end when you see its shape during very heavy rains, except that there is practically no sign of the creature that was really a disappointment as a child. The story is basically an old evil hunter must kill everything they see and they are after a rich brook brook and the children are out to help or just some random hairy man in a forest who likes to pull out random boats through the water. It's not really very attentive, though I would like to see the original made by the creator that would also become a bad crazy creature of the 80s, but in the 1970s "The Town the Dreaded Sundown" also made a very good film slasher.
