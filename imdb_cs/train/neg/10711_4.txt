Minion is probably ... well, minion. Servant Satan, whose goal is to get a key that unlocks the door where his master is imprisoned. It is a demon that has human beings, and when the body dies, it will have another. Anyone who happens to be obsessed will be angry with some berserker. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of the secret order of Templars, who has the task of keeping the minion key. The film begins thousands of years ago, in the Middle East, where a couple of Knights Templar escape the minion. Then it drops forward until 1999, where the key goes in New York somewhere. The archaeologist is designed to study / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is the key, and the film becomes a long-lasting persecution scene between the minion and Lukas and the archeologist. The film is just that the low budget B-film movie. The film has no energy and just sticks. You will watch the chase, but you will never feel embroiled in a story that deliberately takes over the ideas of previous films (especially The Terminator films). Combat scenes with a minion are difficult because you never feel how good or bad a fighter this demon is. "Forcibly" becomes a single army when fighting a group of Templars, but it is angry when it comes to one person. And it should be a long time. All this proves that any sense of logic is just being thrown into the sewer for comfort. The whole idea of ​​the secret order of Templars, the door to hell and the key are not well explained. We only have to accept that they exist. It seems that the film was made with feelings that the story does not have great potential, but just so much to get some money. Dolph Lundgren surely looks like he wants to be somewhere else. Verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
