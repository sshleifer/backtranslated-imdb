1st Watch 5/27/2009 - 4 of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The third world movie with a mummy is the same as the first two in terms of the final result from the perspective of the viewer. The story is similar and the results are ugly. This time, the story is placed in the United States when a new Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he can revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, mummy plays Lon Chaney (which is not very different because he really does not want to do a lot of acting for that character). The new priest becomes a morgue in the city and sends his mom to do his dirty deeds after feeding him with deciduous leaf juice. Again the girl gets in the way when the priest falls to one of the Senator's offspring and wants her, yes - to be immortal with him (have not we heard about it yet?). The plan is ruined, of course, because the burghers hunt mummy torches (like Frankenstein's monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get to continue? I think you'll learn more in the series? or not.....
