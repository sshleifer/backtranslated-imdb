Normally I only write reviews for movies that I really hated or liked. And, as you might say from the number of stars there, I did not like it. Now I suppose you read the plot or even saw the movie, so I skip the summary. We think about it for and against: <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Concept: The premise was set as interesting. Using chaos theory as a topic was interesting. However, it was not done so well. Fix me when I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the theory of chaos was somewhat distorted. The event that appeared in the movie seemed more like a coincidence of coincidence. I think the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "god (s) causing the tsunami to bring the statue back". The presentation seems to be really careless. Some people call this smart, but it seems to be just another focused action movie. Action: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just threw it together to give him an excuse ten roles? The land is extremely conceived; Govind still loses the bottle so often in difficult accidents (his girlfriend just happens to mix the bottle with the package he sends to India, a crazy old lady just throws a bottle in an idol, half the cast becomes unexpectedly meeting in the same hospital, and an idol case only mixed with the one who belonged to the famous singer.) CGI: Oh God, CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in jaws 3 and those that were soaky. I could immediately tell which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look like this. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, now that the action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stuntmen in this were terrible and in fact separated me from the story. up: I have to admit they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so two fake white guys and a fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me. However, it was still pretty bad, I can easily tell which ones have masks. Songs: Music has been distracting and out of place in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character was perhaps the most annoying in the movie. She was loud, silly and irrationally obsessed with the idol. Actually, I found she wanted to die. <br /> <br /> Break the holes and refrigerator Logic: Let me get straight: Labyan monkey was smart enough to get past password-locked doors, but she was not smart enough, the difference between a chocolate bar and a deadly vial. And then the former CIA agent who is on the bottle will find he's going to India. Instead of immediately following, he first married a dancer. A famous Punjab singer with cancer is scouting into a small town hospital in a third world where he could easily afford the best available medical care. He is also shot in the neck with a bullet. You think he'd been killed, but instead the magic bullet had removed his tumor. You read it correctly, BULLET jumped out of the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... The Naidu Character: Perhaps the only nice part of the film was his comedy.
