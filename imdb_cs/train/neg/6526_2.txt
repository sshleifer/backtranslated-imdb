A hopelessly awkward and boring film in which characters stand in rooms or a rocket ship and speak infinitely. Maybe you think things are going to be explored by Mars, but these scenes are shot through a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very dark. Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and monsters are completely unconvincing. There are echoes of the "Monster Bride," when the heroes carefully welcome the octopus as the body gobbler to eat around it before it sinks slightly except that the Ed Wood movie is a hundred times more fun. Better headphones wear, when you look different, a sci-fi script that repeats infinitely will make you crazy. If you find you can not sleep one night, just put it in your VCR and your insomnia will be cured immediately.
