This will be short. Let me first say that I am an agnostic and I am not completely crazy about the xthans, especially the xtan fanatics. However, this document had the tone of a teenager angry at his xtian mother to let him play video games. I could not really take it. Remember how CharlesManson thought it was Christ to illustrate the belief that Christianity can behave evil? I do not know it was just cheap and childish - that the opposition looks unconscious. Moreover, the narrator looked like snob and picky. The delivery was complete. I can not take this document seriously. She could appeal to an angry teenager who asked his xtian mother to let him play video games.
