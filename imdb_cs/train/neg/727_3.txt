I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I never really cared about that short laugh and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short one will be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. The first warning character of a matte cartoon is always without gag payoff. Good night Elmer was boring because he was pulling on the same two gags forever with a predictable payout. On the other hand, this cartoon is affected by the second warning sign of a matte cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The cartoon has at least two gags on the sleeve, but most of them seem far longer than it is because of the huge filling of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finished dinner with dinner and commented, "It was absolutely good," it said, the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in the cartoon (characters who read the lyrics in Woody's cartoon in a later era) are not counted in my books). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it looks like 20 like a redundant dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not fun for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to confirm that he was running a couple of clowns during your career, you can enjoy it.
