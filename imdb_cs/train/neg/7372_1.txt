I'm so confused. I've been a huge fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all of his movies and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares writing scenarios and produces credits for this film, but I have a hard time believing he would decide to overcome his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, shy, fraudulent voice no less. What also fails is that if they have to overlap some of their lines, why does their own voice appear on the others? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But Seagal in this film barely radiates a fraction of the same praise, self-confidence, bravado, spell, and sexual appeal that has so easily shown us in all of his previous films. I found out that I lost the most, it was his rough, self-confident attitude and his bad ass, so easily changed into that delightful smile. Where is the attitude and magic in his face that made him such a huge star ??? I hope this film is not a sign of what Seagal has offered us. If so, his life-long fans will have to admit that Seagal, whom we all know and love, is gone.
