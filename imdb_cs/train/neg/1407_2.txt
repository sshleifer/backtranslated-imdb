After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by the same person as Dolly Bell, for example. Hanging is two hours of stupid cheering without a story. The wild and unbridled Underground humor seems to have fallen into a pathetic clown here. It seems that Kusturica has always been on the hill since he began to make a live calming comedy, starting with Black Cat, the White Cat, which was in my opinion great but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I really enjoyed his early films, and that's why it's mainly a disappointment when I see something like that. Hopefully his next one will be great.
