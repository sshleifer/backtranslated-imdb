Title: Robot Jox (1990) Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Starring Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo Review: Stuart Gordon who is usually associated with extremely horror horror films such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a small detour and made a small science fiction movie. I emphasize the word "little" because it is a very low budget and there is its main weakness. The story takes place in the future. A world in which great superpowers (according to this film are the United States and Russia) refute their differences not only by going to the full blown world war ... but fighting for gladiatorial battles with huge robots. Our hero Achilles must go against the evil Russian robot named Alexander. Lots of cheap animations stop motion. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is amazing, I think. Big nations settle territorial disputes with giant robots? An interesting assumption and one that could be properly resolved if the right budget were available. Unfortunately, what could be a fun movie will end up as embarrassment for another great director. As a child, I loved this movie and I think that if you want to enjoy this movie, you will have to go back to the little child's regime to enjoy it. I showed this film to some of my friends, and the film went on to my friends, "What the hell is this bullshit?" And am I fine that this movie is science fiction by one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? "But as the film progressed into a frenzied terrain, I almost felt like stopping and should not go through the torture because I loved this film as a child and still a little nostalgia for watching it but everyone else just did not get it. I realized that's really so good. The first movie is about huge robots that kick the hell out of each other and to make it possible to achieve a credible way, you'll have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, the expensive effects it would give us helped the audience break the mistrust, but unfortunately it was a small movie from a small business (Empire Pictures, which after making this film smankrofil), the effects will only help us to giggle and laugh, the sets and some wardrobes look incomplete or half lifted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> OK once you accept that you are looking at a mix of animation with a slight stop and thumbnail, you can lmu get and even enjoy big robots kicking hell out of yourself There are certain scenes when robots fight that they are cool and let me go "that's why I liked the movie!" But everyone who they know it and they, some dirty effect will pick you up directly from the protective little cocoon you tried to hide. And the boom, your right back to the realization of this movie just will not fulfill its assumption. <br /> <br /> And that's another thing that bothered me a bit. This film is basically a movie for children. Do you know, giant robots who give it? Stop motion animation? Hi? But this film has had a lot of sexual incidents, and violence is a bit bloody. So I kept asking myself, it's a kid's movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that it was basically a childhood adult-sensitive movie, which is not really a good mix. So for those of you who do not feel a certain naive childish charm watching two robots fighting against each other and if you do not have a nostalgic connection with this movie (just like me), I suggest that you divert from it. Gordons great director, but this movie he did, he just did not do it for me. Well, at least not now that I am an adult adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
