Shecky, is a goddamn goddamn legend, do not make any mistake. Until recently, I worked at the British HiFi & Video Retailer Chain and I was running a test department. We would have gone through many new appetizers, they would have expected to learn how to find a bug in a variety of detritus that are returning from the shops as malfunctioning. Now to cake ^^^^^ test the decision of these new employees, we release them with a copy of Going across the deck. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because whenever anyone who bought a certain Goodmans DVD player that had this movie as a free gift came back to broadcast their DVD player, they never sent Shecky back either. Our new staff would only be forced to use the Going Overboard to test these machines for errors until they found a drive or two of their own tests. <br /> <br /> Now why is this movie so bad, where can I start? Adam Sandler, who can be as entertaining as in Happy Gilmor or the Wedding Singer, had to be damn out of the day. The rest of the crew has fallen, and what about Billy Zan? His name grows up in several of the worst movies of all time and is a decent actor. Crazy. Production quality is absolutely zero. I would be inclined if I could give it away because they did not have the courage to say that it was the full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz" on release. It's even worth your watch to see how far Sandler has come, and how little he can go.
