I did not think the French could do a bad movie, but I was obviously very bad. As has been said, this film basically uses its title as the starting point; his display of his life and man has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. The screenplay is horrible - picky, foolish and flawed - and its overwriting is unusually offensive even in a genre that too often makes its life distorting rather than recognizing history. Together with a fairly decent design, the main benefit of this Valentine Cervi film is physical magic, and it is clear from the outset that the filmmakers are also aware of it; they do not waste time creating different "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with dictation than with conspiracy or character development. Unfortunately, the attractiveness of seeing a beautiful young girl in a state of pretentious sexual arousal can not and can not sustain this movie. It performs impenetrable and the score is too general despite an interesting chord or two. Cinematography is fine and there are some pretty colors, but there are some rather ridiculous sequences that use the distorted lens effect that is more suitable for films from the 1960s than the karst drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often on Artemis's body and too seldom on her paintings. They all said almost complete failure. It's not smart enough or tasteful to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and demanding to work as soft-core pornography. So the French can eventually fail!
