I watched this movie on the basis of very favorable reviews I read about it. I certainly saw something in this movie I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace and its first 15 or 20 minutes is interesting, then begins to go out and to attract, not to mention incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> Finally, you will find out, "What will it do?" "How far will this thing go?" The beginning rests with the figure of Jeff Goldblum, John, going to deli to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and the new clerk of the repository, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. It seems a little too much, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never have any logical meaning, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful loving girlfriend, a safe, well paid job, a nice house, a nice car, expensive suits - says she wants to be lost as Auggie Rose, and lived in a low-paid job, living in a dump with a petty girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people. Why did this blurry, hemispheric film get favorable reviews that I will never know. Sure Goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age - but if you do not have BIG enchantment with Jeff Goldblum and you will have to see every movie that's in him, I would not recommend this step. It's about two hours of your life that you do not come back - and believe me - you will have nothing you should be grateful for when it ends two hours apart from being grateful for not seeing this movie yet! <br /> <br />
