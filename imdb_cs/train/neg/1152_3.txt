I understand what this movie is trying to show. How old are often ignored and treated as harassment, which means they will end up feeling unexpected and their lives are empty. I have no problem with this message, but I feel it could have been overcome in a way that is not so painful to watch. I have a good artistic film, but when the film becomes too confident (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Includes shots of the person who bundle slowly commit that it takes 5 minutes, trying to make a point, but eventually ending with the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you finally want to just tell them to pull them together. This is a movie that you think you should enjoy or evaluate highly and definitely has its "merits", but I was too frustrated and watched it sometimes recommend it to someone else. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (for example: "Notting Hill"), but at least it was a movie you could watch.
