At first I really liked Zombi 2 Lucio Fulci. This film was a complete waste. I could not look at it. The story was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more of a joke. Jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 HARDENING AGENT BRIDING People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this movie does not cost $ 1.00 for borrowing it. I loved films lucio fulc, but this was terrible. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 will be, I think I simply omit them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is an amazing flique tho.
