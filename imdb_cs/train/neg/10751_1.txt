Why am I having money in the last Sundance days? I want a refund ... Can I get $ 16 back? Watching this movie I was waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was like was reading the plot, which was not like a movie. why did the director approach his handy camera and then shrink? It was not very artistic. Why did the director point out that Lulu had given his fingernails in fifteen minutes? Why is it when the actors tried to talk, did they sound like they were reading? Or was that the reason? I felt that Phantom Love had no story at all, and to be honest, it seemed to me that holiday videos were much more entertaining than this movie.
