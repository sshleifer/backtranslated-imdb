In the future of 2001, Freddy is the last surviving teenage Elm Street. Leaving any fear of unsuccessful attempts at humor and pointless celebrity cameo (Rooseanne come ...? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF?) This is linked with Part 2 of the worst hate demon child ever received. Wow it was a piece of crap. Even great legendary Alice Cooper could disappear smell of the film. And when the fuck Freddy's ever a daughter? The film is severely retarded in any conceivable way, shape and form. Rachel Talalay, you laugh at the high sky, girl. <br /> <br /> My class: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Cast and Crew Bios; Jump into the 3D sequence and jump into the possibility Nightmare (additional bonuses for the film can be found on the seventh disc DVD set of The Nightmare Collection) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom content: Trivia games; Screenplay; and a web link
