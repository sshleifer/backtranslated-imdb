I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title that went through horror films. I find it and think of myself "is that title?" This film is a kind of combination of catastrophic films / insect attacks with less known stars in it. It's also a little dull because it has a TV atmosphere where you can see that the movie is losing ad and so on. This land is attacked by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by the building or something is happening nearby, but do not tell me about it. The most unforgettable ant attack for me throughout the movie was the first one to include a baby that falls into the pool after it has been accumulated and, of course, Summers rescue. What else stands out in this is a very nice end when survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. Finally, like most TV films, this film is very tame and not too scary if you do not panic at the sight of an ant.
