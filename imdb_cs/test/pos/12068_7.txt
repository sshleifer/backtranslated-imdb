This show is actually pretty good. Like all TV shows, she has her good episodes and her bad episodes. I've read where people compare this show to Married with Children, and I think it's a similar show for the next generation. However, because of what was expected and released on television in days married to children, that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact, a television show, and not meant to be taken seriously. The war at home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. Parents talk to each other like parents often do, tell their children one thing when they turn around and do the opposite. Certainly, some of the content may be considered controversial. But I find that this show is trying to keep a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are lots of families that are just like that. <br /> <br /> Every episode teaches a "valuable lesson". It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you won't find the perfect solution for every problem a family can encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose two evil evils. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble and hope they learn right from the wrong. I respect the writer for trying to keep the show true, instead of having a magical ending that the Cleaver family has always had.
