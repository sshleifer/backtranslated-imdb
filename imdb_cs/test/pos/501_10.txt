This movie is excellent! Wesley Snipes Being a pure class vampire hunter, kicking his ass in such a liquid and violent way that Bruce Lee would be proud. The movie is fast, exciting ride action and excellent stunts. The first action scene and the last are excellent, and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around all the shocks. The script is pretty good and there is also a sharp dialogue. Wesley had to do more action movies than he has, I know he is a very good actor and in this he is not dotted as much as in his more comic or dramatic roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them \ t Just Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) are coming. Like Wesley's quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as a bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall, the film is sharp, stylish and I hope the sequence is done at the same pace.
