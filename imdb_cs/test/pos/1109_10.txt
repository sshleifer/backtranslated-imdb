I captured this film at Glenwood Cinemas on the weekend at the Kansas International Film Festival, which as usual provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema. I've been excited about Australian film for several years, so I was glad that this movie was included, and I was definitely not disappointed. Well done, it is a terrifying story of one man and his way into the heart of darkness as it was. It reminded me of a dozen Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has a strange insanity, but I was attached to the film for other reasons - that is, it represents a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very believable. I have returned to Earth several times, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. I don't want to go to great lengths and explain my holidays, but director Frayne seems to have an understanding of what's so special and eccentric for Australia, the country responsible for Australia. on the far side, say, Nick Cave and Steve Irwin ("Crocodile Hunter") on the other. Australia. Much more. But I also realize it's only 1 and a half hours before he can do it… ”Sigh. Overall, however, this film is very, very successful.
