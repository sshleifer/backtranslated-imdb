Film noir meets anime ... brilliant! This was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative Animatrix shorts. That was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also like the world record). This is basically a reference to those classic film detective stories and 40s movies, except that it is animated and includes a Matrix. But by being animated, it can capture extreme camera angles, detective lifestyles, shadows and all film noir to a whole new level. Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to be living in his mind in the 1940s but stuck in the modern world, and everything becomes too much when his case suddenly includes science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman enters his office black. . <br /> <br /> My mark: 9/10
