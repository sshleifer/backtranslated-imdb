Somehow I missed many of the first Farscape episodes, so I see them in all types of commands as they repeat on different channels. At first I caught him - quite by chance - while lounging in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds have hooked me up - that's what SF is about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot live ship is what Lexx should be. Plots differ in quality, but in my opinion none falls under excellent. And I must mention Rygel - what a beautifully irreverent character! None of your extraterrestrial extraterrestrial extraterrestrials, which is sugar coated, is a real business - cynical, self-sufficient and full of disgusting personal habits, Rygel's creation of a genius. Last week, the SciFi channel showed "out of their minds" (body episode-swapping). A real classic, I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish ... <br /> <br /> Long, Farscape can debug our screens!
