When I read the "Messiah" synopsis in the TV guide, I wasn't ready for what was in the store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe attempting to resolve the case of severely murders being taken through London. He soon realizes the pattern, there is a serial killer in a free place, killing people with similar names and work to those 12 apostles, and their murders are identical to their corresponding apostle. The two-part series kept me right on the edge of my seat when Metcalfe watched closely the killer, but he was always missing within seconds and discovered a horrible mess left by his unfortunate victim. "Messiah" is sure to cause a great deal of controversy, but it is still the biggest piece of drama that the BBC has shown for a long time.
