This film was well done and kept my interest in the main character for the whole movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine Stu lived today! This film is a picture of what might happen if Stu Unger felt. It was interesting to see how the connection developed. I'd like to see more details about Stu's party, his game play, and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But in all, this film was well done, well acted and the story touched many aspects of life that was full of many events that were greater than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
