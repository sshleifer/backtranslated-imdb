A strong debut film by Murali K. Thalluri, which explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each one in crisis in one way or another. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then follows the lives of the group during the previous hours and leaves the audience in suspense until the last minutes of the deceased's identity. Each of the main characters faces great stressors that we might see as potentially accelerating suicide. The cast of the unknown provides performances of power and emotion. Fantastically well done, especially considering the youth writer / director who was 19 when he wrote the script.
