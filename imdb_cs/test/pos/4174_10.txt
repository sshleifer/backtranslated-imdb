What can I say about this film, which has not said all the other comments here, to a large extent summarize everything, people who love it, respect it, people who hate it ... well, they hate it. This is the movie equivalent of Marmite. I personally devoted myself to memory every second, being cyclic, claustrophobic, introspective, magical, and one of the most unique movies ever made. Despite what many have said, I believe it is a truly iconic film, it's a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered, once discovered that is a fantastic psychedelic visual and an incredible soundtrack will be memorable, a success in itself. One of my friends watching him likened him more to a musical, and in many ways to those who are not fully aware of the context in which this film is made would probably get more of it than to see his head as such. I always liked the Monkees, especially the TV show when it was repeated in the 1980s. My mom recorded my head for me when it was late at night on TV because she knew I liked it, I watched it one day later and put it in my memory until I could find a copy on the DVD about two decades later, What I'd like now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to get more insight into making this masterpiece. We can only hope.
