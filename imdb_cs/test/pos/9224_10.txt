People talk about how awful the script was, and how horrible was the animation, but Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are really Japanese-focused kids. If you look at anime today it's in the same style and it's extremely popular. I don't think this movie should be watched by adults. Just as I don't think it was ever meant to be serious. The things people seem to hate are things I like. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters I've ever created in my opinion. She is smart. It's funny. He is interested in the environment. She cares about her friends. This film can teach so many children. My little brothers liked this movie. I have to say that this movie taught me a lot when I was a kid. When it came out on the DVD I was the first in the series to buy. It's a great movie for kids. So what if it's not perfect, nothing really is perfect when you look at it carefully.
