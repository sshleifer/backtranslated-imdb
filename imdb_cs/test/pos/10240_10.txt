It is interesting to see what people think about this film because it is actually quite unique (though it bears some of Clive Barker's trademarks). While this may seem somewhat cynical, it is a film that is complicated enough to distract those who need standard Hollywood hooks and superimpose that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster. monsters and incoherent plot. Those who need a linear, specific, and unrestrained plot line will hate this movie because the story, like in the novel, lies partly between the lines, or in this case partially off screen, in comments and imagination. . Another possible suspension is the end I can say about, without spoiling it, it's not quite good and not completely bad. In fact, it is not at all too defined, which I know that some people throw into furious anger that they didn't know what happened, but for me, and for many others, I'm sure it adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation and, moreover, the point that the big distortion tends to cause ripples that reach quite far. There is certainly a moral but rather different kind than the standard Hollywood face-to-face display at the end of the movie. To sum up, morality is simple, although it is not entirely simple; prejudice and human tendency to hate different. I love this movie, although, as many reviewers have noted, the actors' expressions (except for David Cronenberg, who makes a beautiful appearance) are rather sticky. I'm not sure they're entirely to blame for their flourishing looks and lack of depth when we see that these are common problems in converting literature into a script. All in all, it's a great movie, provided you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie.
