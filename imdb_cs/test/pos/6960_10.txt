I highly recommend this movie. It disturbs the line between childhood imagination and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it must be seen that it is believed. Actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene the name of the caller becomes a kind of dance. I loved the story, the actor, everything. While I think there were one or two decisive scenes, the whole movie was perfectly done.
