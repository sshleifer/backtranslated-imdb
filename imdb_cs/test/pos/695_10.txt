This film is about reality, the submarine war in World War II was not pure precision science. There were no computers to provide accurate enemy data, there was no precise instrumentation that would control the sub. Not all members went to fight with the song in their heart, and smile on their clock face. People expecting to see a "nice war" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, ... ... GOOD, deserve to be disappointed, deserve, to bring reality into their faces. The war is not clean, accurate, it fights for people who are about to break into a song. He will be endured by a terrible, cold / burning, hungry, desperate people willing to do anything to survive. "We Dive at Dawn" is a great example of a desperate need for desperate action.
