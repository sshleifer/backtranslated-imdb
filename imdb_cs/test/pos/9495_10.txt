I loved this movie. Can build nice characters (well, most of them) about the problems they have with their relationship. Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage to her husband, who barely notices her presence (even if she notices her absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life, and why she is prone to a sweet-talking person without being selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction at the dinner table to her anniversary, while her workaholic husband (late for dinner again) eats salty onion with a taste and pushes the bride and groom's dolls out of the way of his plate, are perfect. The show is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter as Jim, a negligible husband of Leila. After losing Leil to another man, Jim literally clears his nude, shaving his mustache, practicing to lose middle age spread, and dressing neatly. There are several shots of Jim at home, lonely and Leila thinking, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old dresses in the closet. The film gives the viewer the advantage of watching Jim's transformation along with Leila. It's not just an appealing exterior; We learned a lot more about the person Jim really is, and we see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines like Jim and Jim, who is determined to win Leila after discovering Schuyler's true character. The most moving moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila find themselves standing under mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he lost. Definitely worth watching.
