I read "Anne Frank: A Young Girl's Diary" when I was in high school and found myself totally immersed in her story and also in the Broadway game of her life in a secret supplement. However, I am a bit confused about how people perceived her diary and her person as a person when they saw her as saints, or have a message of hope for the world. I don't think it was the original intention of her diary. She wrote it mainly for herself, though before she had betrayed the residents of the secret annex she had made some strict transcripts to publish them once. But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who was able to express his thoughts very well and very much in the diary. Undoubtedly, she was a very engaging writer, and she had extraordinary talent when she fully expressed herself in words. You really need to know her well through her diary. However, the importance of her diary is that it is a testimony and an important historical documentary on the evidence that the Holocaust has become. It also brought the Holocaust tragedy closer to home, losing someone to whom we could give a familiar face and personality at such a young age ... literally that her young life tore her away from her and other residents who were murdered in the Holocaust. It is a contemptuous accusation of the Nazi systematic murder of more than 6 million Jews, and that should not be forgotten. But I'm sorry that her diary is being misinterpreted as something else. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the world's most widespread nonfiction book. God's words in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary of a young girl in extraordinary circumstances, and that is it. She is not someone who should be worshiped or adored because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws who had incredible talent as a writer and who died at the age of 15 from typhoid in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a Holocaust victim, and because this otherwise excellent documentary was so vividly witnessed, she was Hitler's most famous victim. In addition to the story of Anne Frank ... the stories of her family members and friends and Holocaust survivors were riveting, alive and powerful. In particular, I enjoyed Miep Gies's testimony and admired that she is still strong and alive today. The testimony of Hannah Goslar was also very interesting. And I also like to hear Otto Frank. However, I also agree that the moving image of a young girl with dark hair and familiar big eyes at the end was especially memorable. Another thing about the Holocaust I disagree with ... is that I don't think it was just a matter of discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper. it was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. An excellent documentary by Anne Frank and the Holocaust to be watched.
