This is a simple episode of ad so far after watching all the episodes of season 11 (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) that is the one that laughed the most, certainly my favorite so far from the 11th year. a toy store a child who has Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. Can you imagine that Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great because Kyle, as he knows, is like "he's fake". Certainly Cartman is in flames and says what he wants to teachers, director, anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now intolerant, basically because Cartman pretended to be taken to meet Tourette's children to see that Tourette's syndrome is real and great because Kyle is as "good" Maybe someone pretends to have Tourette for fun ", in short Kyle couldn't explain that Cartman was pretending. Probably my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but right after that scene, another guy Cartman just pretends to be a boy with Tourette who was in a toy store, Cartman basically told this boy: "isn" with amazing Tourette. But to say what he wants and be for everyone, a brave boy is something like a start for Cartman, his master plan: going to National Television to say anything he wants ("people will call it brilliant television, they will probably give me an Emmy" - fantastic, in this episode the word "s ***" is used 26 times and it's certainly not all. Japan's park won Emmy as a month or so before this episode aired). But here it is a twist, Cartman basically removed all the bricks on the wall, says everything now without thinking, so we heard from Cartman that he had dipped the bed last night, now he is not entertaining for Cartman and he is like "I can't control what I say" and certainly the one who was with him is like "well of course you can't control what you're saying, you have a Tourette" so Cartman is like "my Tourette is worse than I just blurted out cool things about the Jews being lame and such but now it's really bad. ‚ÄùThere's also things about Chris Hansen and Catching the Predator, actually what happened to the perverted here happens to a lot more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind it to stop Cartman, Kyle ends up being a Cartman savior Fantastic! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERN Over "South Park" October 3 Episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, the Comedy Central cable network will broadcast an episode of "South Park" which one of the young of the characters, Cartman, "Gets" Tourette Syndrome. Due to the nature of this program, we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and receive numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community. We've already taken some pre-emptive strikes, such as asking that comedy central air our public service announcement (featuring comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. In addition, once the episode is broadcast and we are able to see exactly how the TS is rendered, we will be able to answer the specific issues and issues we have with the writer show. "We were really surprised that the creators so long needed to use TS as a comedic feed in this program because there is no disability, illness or controversial topic for them," said Judit Ungar, president, TSA. "We are always seeing TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and the show of this size and popularity is definitely no exception and provides a way for TSA to disseminate factual information about this failure," said Tracy Colletti- Flynn , Public Relations and Communication Manager, TSA. We will publish an official statement on this page with TSA's response to the show after the show. TSA RESPONDS on "South Park" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, just as there were too many media portraits peop le with Tourette Syndrome (TS), the South Park seasonal opener (" Le Petit Tourette ", 10-3-07) served to maintain an even greater myth that most of the affected TSs have involuntary bad language outbursts. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS have never experienced this tragically social stigmatizing symptom (medically named coprolalia). For viewers who are less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, couldn't the misleading release report be clearer? if the curse, you don't have TS. Despite our premonition concerns, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well explored. A very exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, though attentive viewer, was a surprising amount of accurate information. The scripted input of parents, neurologists, peers, and therapy sessions with the "TS Child Support Group" served as a clever device for providing this to the public. "There is no doubt that the South Park episode has triggered increased national awareness of TS. However, we are very concerned that schoolchildren with TS will be ridiculed and even bullied by insensitive peers who could see the program," said Judit Ungar, president of TSA. "We realize that more than a decade of satirical writers' parodies have not spared any group of celebrities, people with disabilities, or political figures. The fact that TS has been the subject of a popular TV show is evidence that the public is much more obvious. where we worked too hard to prove it, it can sometimes prove to be a double-edged sword. "<br /> <br /> TSA contacted the program's executives prior to the broadcast and will be in touch with them again. Maybe we can turn it into an opportunity for positive awareness of TS.
