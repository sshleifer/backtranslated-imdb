this episode is not inconsistent, as another person has said. the source agreed to help because he would not keep his word if you pay attention ... he says that after she (phoebe) agrees to stay there in hell, "I GET I AM A BALTHAZOR THAT I WOULD NOT BE IN THE FUTURE ABOUT THE FUTURE ... ... and not allowing COLE WARN SISTERS LIKE PHOEBE NEED TO REPLACE DEAL IN THAT, THAT'S PRUE DIED THAT HAS BEEN HARDED THAN PIPER AND HEAD, AND THIS WERE NO PHOEBE THAT he would call LEO, and in the past LEO SAID said he SIMPLIFIED THAT THEY WILL BE LESSED, pay more attention next time, and after this episode it's not "CONTINUE ..." that is the end of season 3, and for season 4 they can't show anything out of PRUE because they own the rights to "PRUE" so the producers would have to pay her for what it is, this is the last episode in which it is!
