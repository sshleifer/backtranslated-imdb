I heard an interview with the main actor who said the film wasn't supposed to be a horror movie, but he himself would describe it as a mental horror. I'm not sure why he's traveling to this place, but everything is monotonous, no bright colors, no sincere smiles, nothing personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be happy with the life of this kind of life. Our "hero", although from the beginning seems to be poorly positioned and feels alone. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so important and good is the remarkable resemblance to life in many major cities or even countries today. You have to work, you should not let your colleague know your weaknesses, show up on your wealth, car, etc., and above all, you lack the true love of the children 's life. Of course, you don't see children or old people in this movie - they just don't fit into a company of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure that this utopia doesn't come true!
