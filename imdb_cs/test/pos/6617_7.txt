First let me say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized I was totally uncoordinated. I always thought it was great to watch cats who know how to get to extremes, but I was never a skateboarder and I never really watched the sport. I said it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers said these guys were waving flags a bit, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for shaking the skateboarding world and providing some good shots of their innovations to support it. It's great as viewers can see these guys, both then and now, and the footage they shot when they grew up in California provides an interesting nostalgia that goes a little beyond skating. I would never realize where the extreme skating came from, but these films put together all the pieces and give us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least biased, but not all the documents? It is worth watching for anyone interested in sports or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970s.
