I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out and it stayed with me 35 years since then. When the movie came out, all the theaters in the St. Louis was distributing as a "lure" a package of flower seeds that had the name of the film on the front, and so on. On the back of the parcel, she read, so many words ... plant the seeds at midnight. If the white flower grows, you are saved ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed! All I have to do is say that for the eleven-year-old boy, I didn't sit the seeds for fear of what might appear. Here's a spoiler: As the movie begins, you see a small toy tank moving in dirt. On a small road, the family leaves the city and suddenly the camera turns to the tank and is full. It rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, then, like a sudden, tank is small again. The reason why this film took me so long was because I had a precise toy tank like the one in the movie !!!! Unfortunately, I don't know what happened to it, but I've been looking at it carefully since then !!! Turn off the lights, insert a DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good!!!
