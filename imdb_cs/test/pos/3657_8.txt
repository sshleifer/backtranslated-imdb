Hari Om is about the impossible love between a French tourist and a car rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a meeting with an indifferent friend. A third-world film that cares for the lush dreaming of a lunatic comedy is characterized by the stellar performance of Vijay Raaz, who has become one of India's busier actors after his performance as a monsoon wedding planner Mira Nair. In an interview, Raaz proves that his success is totally intact and positively responds to the questions. At university, he discovered love for acting and joined the main theatrical ensemble, but for one who has so much formal education, he is surprisingly incomprehensible about his craft. He talks about honesty and purity as the sources of his approach and the seriousness of his desire to tell the viewer something authentic. On the screen, Raaz expresses emotional integrity and dramatic reassurance that he will raise his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director Bharatbala cast and directed it perfectly. It has a beautifully expressive face that the camera returns to; The close-ups of this face are as convincing as the shots of Camille Natty, who is as beautiful as Frenchwoman Isa.
