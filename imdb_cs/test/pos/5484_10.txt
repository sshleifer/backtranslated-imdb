I saw this movie for the first time at night. Wow! What movie! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting. I don't want to give a single word about a conspiracy because I think it would be better for people to go in the winter. READ THE FOOT OVERVIEW SUMMARY BEFORE YOU SEE THE FILM! All I say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and Jeff Maguire's screenplay are the top. I wish all the thrillers were like this.
