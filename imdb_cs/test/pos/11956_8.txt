If I ever wrote films or made them, I would like one of them to be. I enjoy the sense of humor and jokes that are inside. This movie does stupid things without it. Names of places and characters are invaluable, Generic New York High School, Squid Calimari (George's sister), etc ... genius. I've seen this movie so many times since it was the core of cable TV when I grew up, of course I didn't get all the jokes back, but it was still funny.
