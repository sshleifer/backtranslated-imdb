We all know the pieces and pieces of Gulliver's travels. Small people, yeah. Liliputians. Giants too, some of us will remember. Some may remember the word yahoo that comes from here. It was it stops for most people. Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. That was the first thing I read, and the last time it was a lot of people. It's treacherously written, like many old adventure books. Children can read it. Yet it is a drip of satire, black and uncompromising. This is something I think most writers will forget when they adapt this film. But this movie remembers. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives credible and serious performance as a world-class man who is thrown into mysterious lands like our own. Gulliver's paths criticize everything. Theists, scientists, government, ordinary people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few of them are spared and most of the satire is as fresh as today. Although the film is very faithful to the story, it also dares to add new angles that work very well. The screen writer deserves all credit for keeping the balance between time and activity (this is not boring, that is). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are beyond the scope of television film. With some marketing this movie would do well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds of Gulliver's visits are well-made, explained in detail and often very funny as well as the Swift book. <br /> <br /> Actors are all professionals because it's British production. Mary Steenburgen excels with Dr. James Bates, a cold cruel doctor who, like Nurse Ratched, just wants the best for the patient. So a modest suggestion, if you ever get a chance to get this movie, then. It's a real gift.
