As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of sport history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to golf class issues at the beginning of the 20th century. The film depicted the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought inside, from his childhood trauma, when he was evicted to his own inability to break the glass ceiling that prevented him from being accepted as equivalent to an English golf company. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, a mere caddy in the eyes of the upper crusts of the Americans, who mock at his attempts to rise above his position. The best thing I loved best is how this class theme manifests itself in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working class worker who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by a higher class; but his mother recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to continue his dream of rivaling those who think he is lower. Finally, golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual site of the historic tournament, the small freedom taken by Disney does not hurt the beauty of the film. There is one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think of Disney. The end, as in "miracle," is not some Disney work, but one that only human history could write.
