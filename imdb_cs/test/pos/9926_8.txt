One of his lesser known films, many horror fans have still grab this Dario Argento offer, which is unhappy. This is mainly underestimated because it is not really enough people. The film boasts class-Argento gore, with its usual close-ups set to wild rock scores. While it is true that this scenario is not too complicated, it is not nearly as bad as the other records in its genre, or its own personal resume for the matter. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more "fear" that he likes showing his own acceptance in his films. Worth a good look at every night.
