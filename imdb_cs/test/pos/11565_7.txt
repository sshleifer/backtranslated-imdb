It is a cute little French silent comedy about a man who bet another one that cannot stay in this castle for one hour because of his persecution. And once you enter the house, it looks much more like a crazy fun house or maybe as a follow-up effect of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a weird menagerie of animals, special special effects and gags as well. It's very hard to describe, but the visuals themselves are worth seeing the movie. However, understand that even a self-confident director also had a lot of "funny gags" that fell completely and wounded the movie. His "camera tricks" were not so complicated, but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THEE and KEEP WATCHING - that's better. The movie is fast, fun and worth seeing. Especially I liked watching Max Linder play and ambush - he was so expressive and fun! Too bad he is practically forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad reading, check out the resume IMDb on it.
