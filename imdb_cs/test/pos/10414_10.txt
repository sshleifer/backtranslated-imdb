This show must be from my favorite horror TV shows of the 1980s. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a precious jewel. If you agree with me, please sign this petition I started to get the word for the Monsters and get on the DVD. Here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim Glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the introductory introduction with the monster family. That scared me! One of the things I would have to ask the DVD creator to include would be to hear the organ sound right in front of a commercial break. I don't know if any of you remember this part, but that's one of the main things that I remember. I mean, come on! The War of the Worlds TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters and also Tales of the Darkside and on Friday the 13th series should also be released! We fans must speak our minds! We need this amazing DVD show, so PLEASE spread the word !!!
