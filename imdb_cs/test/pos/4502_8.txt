I haven't read a novel based on "The Kite Runner". My wife and daughter who did this thought the movie fell on the long side of the book, and I'm ready for it. But the film itself is good - not big but good. How exactly does it depict the trigger created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does the Taliban intolerant regime that followed? I would rate C + on the first and B + on the other. The human story, an Afghan American who returned to the country to save his childhood son's son, is well done, but it is on this number that I said the book was much more convincing than the film. The most exciting part of the film, however - kite matches in Kabul and, later, a mini-competition in California - could not be settled by the book. I'd bet on that.
