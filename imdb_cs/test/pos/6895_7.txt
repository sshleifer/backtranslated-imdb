I Sell the Dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that does not take too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. 85 minutes of film breeze and the film is full of pieces of sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes bloody, sometimes all three at a time, but the pieces are much better than the sum of the parts of the movie. <br /> <The story, as it is, follows the professional grave of the thief Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's criminal Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just cut off his head for murder and Arthur has one night before his own head falls for the same crime. Arthur insists he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is willing to admit when he is bribed with Irish whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman). The film is a series of grave anecdotes that Arthur has admitted, becoming a kind of horror anthology - a series of discontinuous stories that are all linked by a similar chorus (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (robbing graves). Like most horror anthologies, there is no consistent mythology because all mythologies are true and happen at the same time, even though they contradict each other. It probably didn't help me seeing this movie at the same time as Trick 'r Enjoy a horror anthology that avoids all the traps I sell. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, more consistent story than I Sell The Dead, which is to be a united story. Another film problem (and I admit it's crazy nit-picking) is the way the movie plays fast and freely with history. Grimes is killed by a guillotine. We may be able to stretch a point and say that Scottish Maiden, the predecessor of the French guillotine, is killed, but Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is a hundred years later since Burke and Hare are mentioned. and they were executed for murder in 1829. The grave robbery as an industry became obsolete with the passage of the Anatomy Act (1832) so the film must take place before then. I know that bringing this up is the most important historical crap, and we are clearly dealing with the universe where all kinds of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to anchor the imagination, to persuade viewers, to suspend their mistrust is to use something real and authentic. bounce fantasy. And it's not like the history of grave thieves or body abductors or resurrers (they say what you like) is a boring story. The most frustrating thing is that writer.danor Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the history, especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes first takes Arthur as his apprentice, he correctly explains to Arthur that, as a resurrection, they do not steal clothing from the dead, because theft of corpses is an offense punished by a small fine while stealing clothes is a criminal offense punishable by deportation or possibly death. So you would expect Wille and Arthur to separate the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the movie), but of course not. You could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and director are the same person. the film, my opinion is that if you are going to raise this joke in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law no matter how stupid it is before you have to follow this idea to its logical conclusion, even if it means that Willie and Arthur end up chasing the zombies through a graveyard trying to tear their clothes and stuff them back into the empty coffin so they don't get into the deportation to steal the clothes for the dead, otherwise don't represent the matter at all. The historic nerdiness party, I Sell The Dead is worth hiring as a mild but funny horror movie that could have been much more.
