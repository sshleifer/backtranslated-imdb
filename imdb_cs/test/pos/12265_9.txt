I'm sitting around crawling movie footage and I really don't see anything I want to see. My appetite still says, "Like BROADCAST NEWS." That's what I want. Something clever and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that does not say attention. This may be the best wound performance (I think it is BIG CHILL, in my opinion): however eccentric, Hurt is smart and play an unintelligent person without making sure - a wink of a wink - the audience knows - a wink of a wink - - Hey, me I'm not stupid ... well, that's okay. The hunter is perfect and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work. <br /> <br />
