I've never seen a John Leguizam character before I watched Freak, and after seeing it again on the HBO comedy, it was better, more animating and with things I couldn't understand at age 14. Spike Lee did a great job of keeping the visual angle to the point of conforming to Leguizam's theatrics and personal narrative style; it is a substance and style that unite but subtly. We get Leguizam's riots about race and sex (pieces of sex are classic), but much of it is about the family, and what's still fresh in my mind is about his father. Even if some things darken in some stories, something fresh or crazy or accidental that Leguizamo pulls out to laugh and works more often than not. If something falls apart (for me anyway), it could be his personality tics here and there. But overall, it's a kind of entertaining material that is not intoxicating, but is so true that sting. Find it if you can!
