Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the US, "Duckman" runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons. Unlike often harmless criticisms found in "The Simpsons" (pretty good show in his own right), and rude-for-rough-sake humor in "South Park," every bit of this series follows the plan. Criticism of American society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, carries much more bites than it does in any other animated series. Cultural references in "Duckman" also tend to be obscure sometimes (someone browsing a wind turbine realizes that most of them have not been caught). In it, it is different from the "Simpsons," which usually uses pop culture instead of high-eyebrows often hidden in "Duckman." * As other people write about it, there is a character growth (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, because the main character is not just an insulting neurotic, but in fact someone who lives personal tragedy (as clearly evident in episodes like "The Once and Future Duck") ... ') and in "Bev Takes a Holiday" (when he takes the chance to say Beverly all those things he couldn't say Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality. One cannot avoid apologizing to him and his lucid madness. <br /> <br /> All in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the US and one of the best series. It's going to be on DVD sometimes, but much more Duck said makes more sense today.
