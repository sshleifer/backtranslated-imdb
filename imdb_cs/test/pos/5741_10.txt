My partner and I sat down to take a look at this movie through a bottle of wine last Saturday and although we had our reservations at first, once the story came, it was actually a grip. The scene in which one of the characters brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoing the work of Korean New Wave auteur Park Chan Wook. The weapon you chose was a peculiar master blow and allowed us to look into the psyche of "grandmother," who strongly changed the connotations of a loving, warm grandmother to a murderous chest. The dialogue was incredibly mobile and lyrical when it expressed the innermost paranoia of the protagonist. Pavlosky's mise en scene selections further enhance the nervousness and manic atmosphere of night events, combining with powerful Oscar performances to create a chilling and thought-provoking masterpiece. The end that I will not spoil for you reminded my partner and me of the institutional masterpiece M Night Shyamalan. Surely one to watch, repeatedly!
