They made me a criminal is a remake of the earlier film Warner Brothers, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, which played Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as prizefighter on lam. <br /> <br /> Hays Office, this remake is actually better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is terribly wrong as a pugilist. With his background and style, John Garfield enters the part he was born to play. Made Me and Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley, who Jack Warner believed in maintaining work among musicals. In fact, Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. Berkeley is doing a great job here and keeps the action at good speed. I especially like the scene where four of Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in the water tank and get stuck when the water level drops. They get it pretty tight and with some good ingenuity. Other performances in addition to Garfield and the children they remember are May Robson, who runs a summer camp for children and Claude Rains as an obsessed detective. Garfield Trail.
