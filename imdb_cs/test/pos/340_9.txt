Kannathil Muthamittal was just one of the most moving and honest movies we've seen for a long time. The story of an adopted girl who, on her ninth birthday, learns the truth about her parenthood. She comes out to learn more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist. The size of the movie lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam has a tendency in this film to create unreal and pompous characters, each person seems real and their interactions are touching and honest. this is why he ranks among his best films. The film is emotionally exhausting and tugs in the audience's heart, keerthana as a 9-year-old amudha and simran as her adopted mother just brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. there are some notable mistakes here, especially the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is uncomfortable and seems completely unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such messages as they did. Another mistake is surprisingly brilliant songs. they again seem to be forced and out, not jealous with the rest of the script. when they said it is still one of the most enjoyable and beautiful movies that will be long and long in India. . This beauty is not only in script or characters, but in technical brilliance as well as Ravi Chandran's camera work is sheer poetry. all characters perform creditworthy and realistic humor, especially fun in flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> honest 9 !!
