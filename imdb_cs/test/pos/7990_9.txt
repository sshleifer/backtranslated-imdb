As a child I grew up with a television series of the 60s (and not that I'm not so old? POW!). However, when director Tim Burton brought his new vision to the silver screen, I simply stopped immediately and never departed from favoring his installments over the most astonished additions ("Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight") that really made me does not matter. Even if you are going for a much more grounded approach and want to explore Bruce Wayne / Batman psyche further ?? but in honesty, I don't think it can be involved. I wanted crazy fun with a dark stripe and in my eyes what Burton brought, and that's why I can watch them over and over again. After the viewer in 1989, "Batman", thanks to the gaudy Gothic artistic direction and Jack Nicholson, there are no campsite prisoners but a psychotic Joker. Burton would return three years later and continue my favorite batman movie. 'Batman is coming back'. Camp, but good. In what would be fair to be even more expansive, louder, rougher and nihilistic and have two villains at the cost of one enemy. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito coming out on the limelight) and the flashy Catwoman (steamy Michelle Pfeiffer, who fills the suit nicely) that comes to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (aptly thoughtful by Michael Keaton is just as laudable and looks pretty impressive in that bat suit? Look at his eyes) plays the second violin on the bad guys, but I've always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman, who gave him a terribly grim mystery, but also a psychological complexity that has never felt the need to force feed. Also his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served. Burton's vividly atmospheric direction opens with its elegant Gothic style, which carves the world of carnival comics and filters out with a wonderful array of characters and live costumes. The moody tale (which is probably tad too long) is rather symbolic in its approach, rather it shows its spontaneously retracting and extravagant sets and the sharply etched artistic direction covered with dark shades and gray-blue neon lighting. winter background. The free-flowing camera work takes years, and Danny Elfman's spacious score balances playfulness with grim touch with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the show can be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken plunges into the charmingly glassy role of Max Shrek, a two-sided businessman. Pat Hingle is back, but very little has to do, because Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough are amazing as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens.
