Okay, so Ghoulies 4 is kind of bad. And in fact, it doesn't even have ghouls. And the deal is wrong. The story is stupid. But I forgot to mention how funny this movie is. It's so unpredictable and so ridiculous that it's too fun to enjoy. There are only two ghouls in the film, and in fact they do not seem to be related to Ghoulies in another movie. But they're pretty funny. And the funny thing that Jonathon Graves is coming back to this. If you saw the first one, it was a character. In my opinion, it's better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one that is in the grocery store. "Watch K-Mart Shoppers!" Watch this if you like bad movies. It's so bad it's good. And did I mention that Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
