I thought Crystal and DeVita were great. The film is rather off the wall, but there are some unforgettable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and on top, but also very funny and effective. The character should be pretty horrible, why else would someone entertain the thoughts of killing his mother? Crystal's wife - she's a "slut" that everyone would want to accept, and her role, though smaller, is also effective because she has to justify Crystal's ridiculous case of "writer's block". While there are certainly dark moments, the film is not depressing, and despite the murderous urges the protagonists feel, they also have redeeming properties. Overall, it's one of the funniest movies I remember, one that doesn't bother me to watch a couple of times.
