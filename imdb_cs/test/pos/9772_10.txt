I never sat six hours straight to watch the miniseries, but Changi changed it. I won't lie, I know that some Aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring (actually, just like Aussie flicks themselves, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different strip. Although it is not historically accurate, as we are constantly reminded, the show combines excellent acting, excellent script, and the addition of humor to provide a fun and emotional perception of life in a POW camp in World War II. Keep in mind that the show was not meant to be a documentary document, so don't let any factual mistakes disappoint. This series exhibits John Doyle's creative writing (aka Roy Slaven), known for his comedy rather than anything, and the outstanding director and actors move this creativity perfectly. If you want to see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official site, it's really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true changi accounts. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Changi yet, make sure you don't do anything all day because you want to watch the whole series.
