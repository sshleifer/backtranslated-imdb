I always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the hardest actress of the 1930s and 1940s, although several of her film roles are unforgettable. Today he remembers the most for TV shows "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; she seems to have accepted most of the role and made the most of it to make the film successful, and so the directors loved it and many ordinary images have gained credibility with their presence. "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very common effort whose conspiracy mimics credibility and is not even at Christmas. It does, however, have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some top character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall, so there are conspiracies and funny moments that no doubt seemed more real in 1945 than today. To begin with, the conspiracy concerns the writer (Stanwyck) magazine who believes the magazine reader is a native goddess, married to a child and living on a farm in Connecticut, but who is truly one living in New York and not knowing anything about cooking or homemaking. Could someone escape such a fraud? Obviously, and even the magazine's owner (Greenstreet) is deceived, even if one thought he'd seen it long ago, even though he was deceiving, but the story is moving on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan ) and Stanwyck's restaurate friend (SZSakall) spends Christmas in Connecticut on a farm belonging to Stanwyck's divine friend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the options available for this purpose. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to keep up the excitement, but you wonder how he can build it. Morgan and Stanwyck are falling on each other, but he has to be employed and she should be married. Regardless, they start what appears to be a sentence affair dancing face to face and steal in a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who saw Stanwyck and Morgan go away together, but still does not get to see one of the neighbors take back a baby who has been borrowed as part of deception and calls the cops to report the kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for theft of the sled and the scam begins to loosen. At this point, the movie is funny as in a ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha, ha and it always ends up as a comedy with combos. did. A good boy gets a girl and probably lives happily ever after. I watch this film every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors in the best story that reflects the way in 1945 and because of Barbara Stanwyck's long fascination. Thank God it was set for Christmas or as 95% of Stanwyck's films that would have been forgotten long ago, and we wouldn't see it again every year.
