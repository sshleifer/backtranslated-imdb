In the Strangers On A Train, it's clear from the start that playboy wastrol Robert Walker has chosen Farley Granger as a reluctant accomplice to the murder pair. Granger is a semi-public character, he's a tennis professional, but not particularly tall. But he is tall enough to know that Granger is trapped in a love-free marriage and would like to marry Ruth Roman freely. So when they meet as full Strangers On A Train once in the afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will be at least sufficiently impressed with the possibility that if two of them, full strangers, would commit murder on the side that would sacrificed by their demise. Although Granger is discouraged by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this movie is that you can see in the show that gives Granger a temptation. In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger's wife, whose two men timed him and even became pregnant by another man, expects Granger to kill Walker's father again so that Walker can inherit his property. Today, Walker would be called a trustworthy child and in that little malevolent. Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career, ironically in his latest complete film. Walker died next year with most of my Son John's ended. Nor does Hitchcock do Farley Granger. Of course, when Granger resists the murder of people who have never done anything to him, tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing, first in a tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and the waylay Walker before he imposes evidence to denounce Granger at the crime scene. And also in the final climax with the fight on the carousel between Walker and Granger. Foreigners on the train are Hitchcock at his best, we shouldn't miss him and you should watch him in the movie classes cut.
