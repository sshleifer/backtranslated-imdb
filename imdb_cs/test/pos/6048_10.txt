According to today's standards, DI might seem a little hockey. The Lee Emery version is more accurate. I graduated from a training camp in Parris Island, SC in 1964. Jim Moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957. I can't comment on the plot, but I thought the end was unrealistic for MCRD. PVT Owens is like many who find themselves in a much more difficult situation than he was negotiating for. Like many others, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. DI is a more Korean era and a complete metal jacket is more Viet Nam Era. Today's movies allow such things on the screen. I have a DI in my collection. I recently found it on DVD.
