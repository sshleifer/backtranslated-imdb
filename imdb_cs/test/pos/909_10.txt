Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotional, powerful ... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and yet I think it was inadequate. All I can say is that I'm in love with this movie. Applause Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" live forever.
