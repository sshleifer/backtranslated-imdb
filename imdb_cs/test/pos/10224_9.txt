I wish there was a category that would place it differently than Horror. It's just not. It's true it's terrible moments, but I don't feel like it's a horror movie. I will say that this film could be better. A million small things could be changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> What I said I love this movie. I am often sad that people did not understand it. It has always been clear to me that the purpose of this film was to say ... things are not always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil' is not. Barker was at Con, where I went, and he spoke a little, then watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things he wished to put in the film couldn't be, and a piece cut out of the movie that he believed was long lost. That was a piece that helped shed light on Boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details. I know that some people are bothered by not having more information about all the "breeds" in the background. I read a novel that was based outside as well as many comics. Because of this, the film always looked like a production for the whole story. A much more involved story that unfortunately never had a chance to live. Despite all the shortcomings, this movie might believe it has something to offer. 'Monsters' are beautiful, very imaginative. While acting is sometimes a little stiff, there are some very sensitive lines. Whenever I watch it, I find something new. Hold on and watch the Boones chest at the end. At one point, Decker stabs him and shortly after Boone falls to the card table. She ends up with a card stuck to her chest. This card will stay there for a while even after Lori pulls out the knife. He'll stay there until Boone releases him. I love it. That was a beautiful little detail I thought. Basically what I want to say is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, don't look at it. If you think people can sometimes be more evil than we ever dreamed of. This is a movie for you. This is a film about how men are destroying what they do not understand or fear.
