Dogtown and Z-Boys Summary: Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who have changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice, California, as we know it today. With their low core style, they embarked on Larry Bertlemen's influenced way that would lead to countless successes and a few setbacks. After Dogtown's articles were featured in the reinstated Skateboarder magazine, the sport was redesigned and Zephyr skateboard team members forgot about Jeff Ho, and seemed to be on summer holidays for the rest of their lives by joining other skateboard teams that they could afford. pay them as movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team by Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (Photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still fine and surfing / skating. Jay Adams, at the time of the document, served time for drug related fees. Chris Cahill was last seen in Mexico at the time of the documentary. Topics: Topics of this document are a kind of reading between the lines, but if there was a clear overview of the topic, it would be that even children can ignite revolutions. Other topics would include large-scale parties in the past that could lead to the future failing, and a very beneficial future could be handy by planning and carefuling about property. Another Work: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries that he has written, produced or directed. The most common theme is surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, Bones Bones and Lords of Dogtown. He also made films with the theme of growing up in America as a teenager, movies such as: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Bloods: Made in America, and 70s: A Decade That Changed Television. Subjects: Dogtown and Z-boys are original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team, with the exception of Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk in interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up during the 1970s by reading Dogtown articles and skateboard enthusiasts. Dogtown skaters, but not the team, were interviewed. Cut: The cut of the film was, in my opinion, phenomenal. There were scenes of talking subjects so that viewers could see who was talking and getting a sense of character, but instantly cut the archive footage to explain what the speaker was saying. When the song could better explain the emotions of the subjects, for example, when Adam Adams's miserable life was a subject, the Old Man song by Neil Young, which evokes many emotions, was played. Sean Penn was the narrator for the film and explained the transitions throughout the film. The film has been presented chronologically since the Zephyr Surfers team was merged to form a skateboard team for all the Z-Team boys who left the team to join other skateboarding companies or create their own company. Cinematography: The film was made in an interesting way. The film of all the lecturers was black and white and all archive footage of Z-Boys surfing or skating was in color. Of course, shots from the 1970s were grainy, but he only improved the film. The interviewees were mostly shot in the same area they were in, but they were all out. All the shots were very well controlled and archive footage, which I found very surprising.
