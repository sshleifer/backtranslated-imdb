"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this is that it is unavailable on the United States DVD. But everything is not lost because it has now appeared in region 2 in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only rambling but utterly ironic when one thinks that a film depicting the founding and founding of such a uniquely American organization such as The Western Union Telegraph Company is a non-regional region. It just doesn't make sense! Produced by Fox in 1941 "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. It was only the second opportunity a great German director committed to driving the Western! He did a great job a year ago with Fox "The Return Of Frank James" and in 1952 he had another western trip with the wonderful "Rancho Notorious". Lang was no Ford or Hawks, but with the "Western Union" he turned into a subtle solid western that holds very well. Beautifully photographed in the early three stripes Technicolor Edward Cronjager boasted a good cast led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. Female management is Virginia Gilmore, who has really little in the picture. An actress who has never done anything out of her career. Her presence is only cosmetic. It's strange that Robert Young has the highest price at Scott! It is obviously Scott's picture from the very beginning, when we first saw him in the amazing opening scene of the film, haunted by a position across the plains. Young doesn't have much to do throughout the film and seems to be in the West. Looks just stupid against Barton McLane in the shootout! An actor who never appreciated himself - except perhaps "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a chain of forgotten romantic comedies in the 1940s and 1950s, culminating in his greatest success when he worked for seven years on television "Marcus Welby MD" flight. He died in 1998 at the age of 91. <br /> <br /> Western Union describes the telegraph wire connection between Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union chief Dean Jagger to protect the line from the Sioux attack, as well as McLane and his gang trying to destroy the line for their own insidious ends. Robert Young is a young rear east engineer who joins the company and leads Scott for Miss Gilmore's affection. Some comic relief is provided - and irritably so some would say - Slim Summerville and John Carradine appear in a poor role as a company physician. Overall, though the beating good west, though on Region 2, but in the sparkling good quality that fans will be pleased. My only crib is that there are no accessories, no trailer, and that terrible cover with blunt graphics. UGH! Footnote: Interestingly, the "Western Union" affiliate was Harry Joe Brown, who would later create a partnership with Randolph Scott that would create some of Scott's best westerns in the 1950s.
