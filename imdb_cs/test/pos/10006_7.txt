I felt that this film has many good qualities. Cinematography was certainly different and revealed the stage of stage design and story. The original characters as actors were certainly a success and I felt most accurately played, of course, playing alone, but definitely unique. Cultural aspects can leave a lot of disappointment, because familiarity with Chinese and Oriental culture will answer many questions about parent-child relationships and stigmatization related to every drug use. I found an interesting story of Jia Hongsheng. On the note is a story in Beijing and some of the fashion and music of the early 90s, although it was made in 2001, so it's sometimes really cheesy (Beatles crap, etc.). No matter, not ten or twenty, but if it's on TV, look at it.
