After a group of young friends experience car problems when traveling from a beaten path, they accept a help offer from a lonely local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), the owner of a nearby museum full of historical waxes. Once on a ghostly road appealing, friends are watched by a mask-wearing freak who can bring museum figurines to life through the power of mind. The Tourist Trap's Evil Guy is a demented hybrid between the Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a Leatherface and Anthony, a scary child of the classic Twilight Zone episode 'It's a Good Life', while the plot is a mixture of elements from the above TCM, Hitchcock Psycho, and House Wax. However, the atmosphere and realization of the Tourist Trap is so totally inactive that in this respect it is virtually impossible to compare with other earlier films. Director David Schmoeller's persistent inventive and unpredictable treatment his own screenplay gives the film a distinctive nightmare and, thanks to the brilliant left-handed performance of Connors, the incredibly terrible score from Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly disturbing mannequins with removable jaws and the presence of super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film in (and shortly) tiny denim trousers and a breast-embracing figure, is an unforgettable and ultimately unique horror experience that deserves its cult following.
