This is just a good ole created by Western .. not too complex or long. He does not disappoint himself by thinking that it was just for fun. Yet it is one of those westerns that you can observe once and do without them. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers was part of bank robbery (he even steals Scott Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing that his good friend is a thief) . In the red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny that several dead have broken into it. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne, who gives him and buddy "Nitro" (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) the place to stay. Cheyenne wishes to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad bunch want to rob the Red Valley Bank. It's actually Jack who's behind the murders, but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they did not commit (the robbery was one of Cheyenne) and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets rid of the murder. There are sub-grounds that include Cheyenne's fall in love with Alison McLeod {Evelyn Keyes; The irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned unified theft with Lester. to steal the Red Valley spoil town. Will Upton reveal Uncle Willie's treacherous plan and Clanton's banker? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through without his conscience bothering him? This movie has an enormous puzzle in the barroom and dandy from the shootout. Columbia couldn't choose a better genre to start the coloring process, because this film has a few fine mountain shots, as men give chase on horses and the like. Don't expect your socks to be thrown away, but the movie is simple and changes well.
