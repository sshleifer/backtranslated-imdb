I was a passionate fan of the squirrel since the late 1970s - early 1980s. When this movie came out, it was necessary to see it. And after I saw it, I went right away and bought it! The movie is great, I love the animated action it brings, and the music is great (yes, I bought a CD soundtrack ...) Featured video for anyone looking and enjoying!
