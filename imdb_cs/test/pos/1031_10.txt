'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of docudrama in his finest design. Well written, well acted by actors who carry a plausible resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative and very entertaining. The design and costume set captures the US impression during World War II, and rendering and dialogue make the viewer feel as if he was actually present at Los Alamos and caught the thrill of Manhattan. The only downside is that it is a British production, and some actors do not have the ability to influence a convincing American accent. (The skill of contemporary Australian and Irish actors engaged in unnatural dialects is amazing.) The story is fully in line with the definitive history of the development of Richard Rhodes' atomic bomb. Sadly, the mini-series was only shown several times on PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently disappeared into oblivion. 'Oppenheimer' is more favorable than the newer 'Fat Man & Little Boy is a feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered) and Dwight Schultz (TV' A graduate ') -Team ') as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about 4x as long as the Newman feature but uses all the extra time entirely to its advantage.
