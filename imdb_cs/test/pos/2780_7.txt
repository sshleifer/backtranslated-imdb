Many visitors have now signed up to exchange students to Barcelona and are disappointed when they do not have such an exciting time. The film was pleasant. Of course, it's always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. But I have a very strong problem with part of the movie. A lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women want to be physically controlled (which is a problem) and shows him some movement around his ass that will surely win a woman. Xavier then tries to catch the butt on a shy married boyfriend - who starts saying "no no" "I'm married, I'm married" but then somehow succumbs to grab ?? Suddenly she moans "yes yes" and goes on the benches at Parc Guell. I found it really offensive. Furthermore, it is very stereotypical. How often have we seen scenes where a woman says "no", but of course it doesn't mean? No means no. Grabbing asses / physical domination will not do it right. This simply supported the stereotypical rape myths. I wasn't even sure how to read another scene where the lesbians boast about how it worked and how next it would be. suck it, slut '(or something like that). Did he really think there was a way to go to a woman without respect for her feelings? This section really destroyed me.
