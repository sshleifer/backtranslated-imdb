I remember watching the police unit! when he first came to ABC in 1982, and I thought it was a very entertaining show, thanks to the many gags, word sequences and scripts. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt he deserved a much longer run, but the network manager thought the show required too much attention from the viewer because of all the gags in every episode. The one I remember was in the hole where the episode title was different from the title displayed on the screen. Leslie Nielsen's portrait of Frank Drebin was dead, but very funny and his role was in the style of Jack Webb's Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his several roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't as bad as Norberg, but one of the characters who performed was Johnny Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were portraits of Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSord. <br /> <br /> Although a police unit! had a short life on ABC, Zucker Brothers did not give up the concept that proved even more successful in the Naked Gun movie series. Close with regular closing gag. Stop the end.
