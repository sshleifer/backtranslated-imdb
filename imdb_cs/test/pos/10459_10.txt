Simply one of the biggest movies ever made. Worthy to sit next to such European masterpieces as GAME RULES, GRAND ILLUSION, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, DESIRE WINGS, VIRIDIANA, NIGHT OF CUTTING STARS, LA STRADA, ORDET, PASION JOAN ARC, FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS and MADAME DE ... both blessings ... and an almost perfect work of art.
