RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even won the Best Picture Academy Award nomination. Negotiations, scenario, continuity, et cetera, all are just perfect; and the story is worth 82 minutes for the viewer. Although the image of soft leaves is a real life story, since the murder victim is more a Jew than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguises never work, maybe not intended. <br /> <br /> I could choose a few details, but just for fun. In Washington, DC, there was no movie house at night in 1947 - and if I wanted Robert Mitchum and his friend not to talk to the show. There were no bars where GI could pick up a pretty blonde. NONE! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the last murder scoop, he should have bought the Daily News; not Times-Hearald, the star of the evening and certainly not the Washington Post. But these little things don't take anything from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from an absolute lack of music score, with the exception of credits. I only saw it in a few movies. On the negative side, since 1995 comes with a TMC introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was "ready" for in 1947.. blah blah blah! As if the fool had some business to judge his better. I would say that the former GI in 1947 - The Greatest Generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than any commentator, film historian or other wise mouth in 1995. Put a sock in it!
