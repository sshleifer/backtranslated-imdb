NBC made a lot of good product when this series came out, but none of them got viewers. At least, according to their executives, who wisely canceled good shows like Star Trek & My World & Welcome To It due to low ratings. NBC advertisers have acquired an NBC ignorance contract. This show stands out as the only time James Garner wasn't able to get the audience. It's ashame because this show had excellent support from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in Rockford Files), on Nevu Patterson on Margot Kidder. Garner played a sheriff who didn't want to use violence to perform his duties. It was a small town, but it was excellent. It didn't take long for Jim Rockford to bring Garner to success, but for my money this show was good enough, it just wasn't at the right time, the right place, or the right opportunity. The show was so good that most of the people who worked on it also got a job at Rockford.
