Above all, those who are weak in the heart should definitely avoid this film. Even those like me who are numb to most of the graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should be careful. I'm not telling you to turn away from the movie, but remember that what you want to see is some kind of distracting material. Definitely not a nice movie to watch, but nothing is put on the screen strictly for shock value. But I have to admit that when I watched the movie for the second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor scene" appeared. The main character is one of the most sympathetic sympathetic characters I think, but we'll start to realize the humanity of her character later in the second movie. In one scene she broke the broken glass in her student jacket pocket after she was dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and nervous as she was in front of a live audience. The student goes into his pocket and screams in pain as he looks at her blood-stained hand. I was most disturbed by the razor blade scene. The student's mother is no more sympathetic than her. When she learns that her daughter will not be able to play, she talks about herself also touching her wounded hand, which is one of those spoiled mothers trying to torture her daughter to become a messenger. Although the film captivated me and captivated me for the most part, I felt the need to explain the character of Isabelle Huppert more. When a woman is fascinated with sadomasochistic porn movies and engages in this behavior alone, you want to understand the root of the problem. The film states that he wants to be loved desperately. So why hate each other? Why does he enjoy sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> Acting is amazing and I liked the shiny stylized lighting. Together, this is not a movie that I would recommend if you are in the mood to have fun, but as I said it is very interesting. And I'm sure if I watched it a few more times, I'd be able to reveal some small things that shed more light on the aspects of the movie I didn't initially realize. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
