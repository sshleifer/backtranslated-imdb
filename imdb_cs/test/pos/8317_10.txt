(r # 88) Brilliant, very entertaining show with spectacular effects. Every fan of these prehistoric reptiles must see it. CGI blends very well with the environment and it's just fun to watch these giants go about their daily business as well as on the Discovery Channel. This show was a blow of genius and throws out his followers "walking with animals" and "the future is wild" out of the water. The biggest episode was definitely the last time we had to watch the last days of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the meteor strike that became their ruin. These things are almost amazing for television. How about a theatrical release? I'd pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a show that can be spectacular, engaging and educational at the same time, it's for you. Dinosaurs have never been colder.
