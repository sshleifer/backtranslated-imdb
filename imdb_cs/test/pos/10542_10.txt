This movie is the best horror movie I've ever seen. acting is terrible and the plot leaves much to be desired, but the puppet has given me nightmares for weeks. Seriously, if you have small children, don't let them see. Of course, I'm a little biased about the irrational fear of puppets and dwarfs. also a body double portrait from a guy who makes mini me verne troyer. and some gratuitous nudity must be in every low budget horror movie. all other horror movies will be forever judged in this book.
