James Franco is just fine in this movie. Not only handsome and charismatic but truly open and vulnerable in a sincere way. At Tristan's screening, some people on his back were for being tied and annoyed and doing the whole thing for James Dean, but I don't think that's true. Blind Spot is proof of his huge talent. In this film it is carried with a different weight completely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. Behind his words you feel the sharp intelligence of observation. The tone is everything. It transmits it through action and tension, as well as gloomy bits of gallows humor. I really like the other two actors. The blonde is absolutely gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his curled hard boy. Some of those criminals looked a little superficial, but it's really a mini-point. The film is absolutely solid and Franco is cool all around.
