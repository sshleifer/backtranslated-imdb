It was a movie he thought a little. Some parts a little cheesy, some parts quite good. The fence thickened occasionally and just as Angella thought (Sandra) found a friend boyfriend was a scam or dead. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER was supposed to be in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all that Angella had gone through. He would pick me up and Angelle over the dumps.
