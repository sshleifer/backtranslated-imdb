This film is a fascinating drama about filmmaking. The actor and actress can't really stand up, but we're on the scene to have sex - for the first time, on the script. The actress shows small emotions on or off the camera on the property, except she freezes in the early scenes on the beach. The actor himself is absorbed and increasingly defies director Jeanne. I couldn't help being drawn into the drama "How are these two possibly acting their way through the sexual scene?" That drama itself becomes more exciting than real nudity and foreplay for cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not beautiful and worth naked! However, there is a beautiful young hand scene that walks through several scenes as extra. I think it's on the left edge of one of the images (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I don't even know if this girl is credited, but when she walks (quite obviously dressed) in self-assured indifference with short blonde hair - SHE is Sexy! WHO ARE THIS GIRL ???
