Was there ever in the Barbet Schroeder monkeys in the 1960s the Angel of Death as MIMSY FARMER? Species Jean Seberg with subcutis. Pink Floyd Score. Despite some insignificant weaknesses, the classic, brazenly torn by Erich Segal / Noel Black for their clumsy JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, playing a similar character, is very attractive in this confusion. MORE, this is a wonderful, great movie about the 60's and simply an important document about his time. A very cult film that joins the cult. No American film then, if I remember, does not write the same territory. MIMSY is a stunning archetype that raises this into mythical empires. Not for a weak heart. Big sex scenes too.
