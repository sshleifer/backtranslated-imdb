If you asked me how the movie was for the whole movie, I'd say it was great! But I left the theatrical feeling dissatisfied. When I thought about it a little bit, I believe the problem was the end of the pace. I feel that most of the film was moving so slowly, and then the end developed very quickly. I would say the end left me disappointed. <br /> <br /> I thought the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher Can Act! Also, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Besides, I thought the different lines of the plots were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it. In conclusion: Good characters, Great drawing, Badly written / edited ending. Go look !!!
