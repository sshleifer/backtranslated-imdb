I liked this movie a lot. The actors were great, especially Potente, who differs in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also able to play anyone; and Loos, who climbs things up (she is also a talented singer - she sings "My Truth", heard when one character picks up a stereo in the lab) Anatomy is a good horror Flick who pays attention to his characters. It is also very gory at times, and the set design is innovative. It's too bad they had to do a sequel that is nowhere near the original. Two other things are worth mentioning on the side note. DVD is not dubbed, which is for a better movie experience. Also, make sure you watch the latest credits start moving.
