"Death Bed: A Bed That Eat" is an extremely bizarre horror movie that really has to be seen to be believed. imprisoned for one of his paintings that provides voice-over narration. George Barry is the first and only film to offer some truly surreal moments, such as the bed absorbing his victims in the mysterious sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little gore, unfortunately the assumption is somewhat stupid and the acting is amateurish.Still as a fan of unusual cinema I get this low budget peculiarity. chance.8 of 10.
