Being "Wallace and Gromit-fan", I was looking forward to this feature film. Surprisingly, I saw it at the world premiere of Vlissingen (NL) at Film by the Sea. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this fun and fun movie. It's about Wallace and Gromit (whom I think they don't need an introduction) who have their own pest control company in the city, which is organizing a giant vegetable contest within a few days. Everyone, including the eccentric baroness, hopes his giant carrot or melon will win the Golden Carrot. Unfortunately, the city is troubled by a lot of hungry rabbits. This is where W&G come. They have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way. It's a very funny and colorful story. Whoever liked three ongoing W&G short films (which are more than great!) Will love this feature film. Indeed, Nick Park has brought a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. As with Chicken Run, I still wonder how he can capture so many stories and emotions in just a few frames. "Good work, boy" ;-) Yeah: Music was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Enjoy!
