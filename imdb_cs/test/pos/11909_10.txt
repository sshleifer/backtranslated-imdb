I liked this movie. That's almost all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job even though I was still very disappointed after all the Iron Eagle movies. And while I was smiling on the inside when the first major teenager dies (I won't give it away), it was done in a nice, convenient way. Almost everyone in this movie does a good job, so look! It's another of those movies I found really cheap, so I bought them and I recommend the same.
