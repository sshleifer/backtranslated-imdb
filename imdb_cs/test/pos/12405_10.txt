This movie was so well-paced that I don't think I actually winked while watching. One intense situation that the other person held me stuck to the set. However, I would like to see Corey Feldman much more in this picture. She just steals every scene she is in. That could be my favorite Corey show. The end was clever and unlike other films that turned away from separate parts of the sympathetic support body, it is a movie! I liked the fact that it is not graphic blood and gore, but more about the viewer's imagination. Bravo. I literally had to wipe the sweat from my forehead during this scene of torture using a paper cutter. In the end, the film works because of its sympathetic lead character and the amazing presence of my favorite evil guy, James Remar (48 hours, remember?). <br /> <br />
