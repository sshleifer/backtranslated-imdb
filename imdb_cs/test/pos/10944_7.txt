Don't expect anything profound meaningful. Most of the fighting scenes are pretty decent. Two front ladies are pretty cute, but their lack of HK action background occasionally shows. Maybe something is missing, but I still enjoyed it. Cheesy humor is unlikely to appeal to anyone who hasn't seen a lot of HK movies, but if you like something like that and have a few hours to fill something nonsensical, you can do much worse than that. (OK, so you could do better, but .......) Certainly at the same level as most Hollywood action trucks. <br/> 7/10
