Dramatic License - Some hate it, though it is necessary in telling some life story. In the case of "Lucy", the main points of Lucille Ball's teen years, early careers and 20 years of marriage to Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a shortened and revised way. The main emotional points of Lucy's life are clear: Lucille's struggle to find her niche as an actress, eventually flowing into a brilliant comedy that made the character Lucy Ricardo a legend; her tumultuous, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi created the first television empire and forever secured her place in history as the most memorable television series. As Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Don't expect to see exactly the same miraculous transformation that Judy Davis did when she played Judy Garland, but York makes the ball strong but sympathetic and very funny in itself. Even though her comedy timing is different from Lucy, he's still believable. The film never goes into detail about its perfectionist behavior on the stage and its ill-treatment of Vivian Vance during the early years of "I Love Lucy," but York's observation portrays Lucy's privately is a nice classification. Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but has his own charm and makes a decent job with the Desi accent, especially in the opening scene. Madeline Winter was decent, if not too memorable, as Lucy's teen. Vivian Vance and William Frawley were not very happy because Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not convinced in the roles. . Not that they were not good actors themselves, they weren't just all those who were good for the people who played. Most actors were from Australia and New Zealand, and suppressed accents are detectable at times. Although the main structure of the film adheres to a historical fact, there are many variations, some for seemingly unexplained reasons. Jess Oppenheimer, lead writer of the radio show Lucy "My Favorite Husband", which began in 1948, is described in this film as coming to the scene to help with "I Love Lucy" in 1951, no matter what he was The main creator! This film also depicts Marc Daniels as the main "I Love Lucy" director for his entire run, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! Although I consider it a budgetary constraint, Ricardo appears to be living in the same apartment for the duration of his stay in New York when, in fact, he changed apartments in 1953. original. Connecticut houses look pretty close to the original, except for the right and left sides of the house, they have been condensed and restructured. There is also Desi, who talks about buying RKO in 1953, during Lucy's red spooky incident, although RKO did not hit the market until 1957. These changes could be for a dramatic license and the film does work on passing the main facts, but it would be an injury to show a little more respect for Oppenheimer and Asher, two important personalities in the history of "I love Lucy"? The biggest gaff comes to the holiday scenes "I Love Lucy", at least a few of them. It is always risky to re-create something that is captured on the film and has been seen by billions of people, but even more when AMOUNT CHANGES have been made. The giant bread loaf scene has been shortened and anyone who is familiar with this episode has noticed the differences right now! The number "We are with a child" was also shortened, but otherwise it was virtually dead. By far the best was the "grape-stomping" scene, where Rachel York really approached Lucy's mannerisms. Producers wisely decided not to try to re-create "Vitametavegamin" and candy factory bits, instead showing actors to rehearse them. These scenes have proven effective thanks to this approach. The main mistake of the movie is that it makes the viewers already know a lot about Lucy's life, because many of them are exaggerated or omitted at all. Overall, however, it gives a decent portrait of Lucy and Desi's marriage and factual mistakes can be overlooked when character development works effectively.
