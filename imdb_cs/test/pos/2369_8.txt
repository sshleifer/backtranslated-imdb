I recorded this at Sundance and didn't know it was Miike. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. Then I saw things like a dance saxist <br /> <br /> that sounded like Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew it must be Miike. I missed the initial credits and had to wait until the end of the credits to see Miike's credits. <br /> <br /> He hasn't let me down yet. The audition, the city of lost souls, the Ichi Killer, and the Happiness of the Katakura were all good swings, and now I found it was the third in the trilogy. Other than Miike and Todd Solendz, no one is making interesting movies today.
