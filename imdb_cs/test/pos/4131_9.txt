Gary Busey is excellent in this music biography. Great singing and excellent soundtrack. Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba. There may be some historical inaccuracies in reading other comments. Regardless, it's a fun movie to play with your finger, and a good introduction to Buddy Holly's music.
