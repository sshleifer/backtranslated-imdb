Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and persuasive approach to the 70th year of industry is followed by Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), over six years of sex, drugs and disco. His accidental encounter with pornographic director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the greatest adult actors of that time. Dirk's character is based on real-life porn actors John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known for being extremely "well-endowed". This is where Dirk finds the initial success. The main themes in Boogie Nights are those related to the genre's film; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the subject of pornography with some control. It is not played back and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on the screen. During the film, cocaine is immensely abused, and the film setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at the time that the film perfectly captures. However, Boogie Nights does not support cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdose. For example, at Jack's party they find a girl who recently and graphically overdosed; he pours blood from his nose and begins unconsciousness. The film, before this scene, was quite positive and comical, but from this moment it pretends to be dark that it occurs. <br /> <br /> Musical scenes are performed brilliantly, from the brilliantly-presented disc scene to Dirk singing terribly in his new musical career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and an unforgettable sound experience. The standout scene in the whole movie comes to music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) attend a drug store in Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to quickly sell fake drugs. background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring much more into the scene. Boogie Nights is filled with scenes that make the film even more fantastic. The Boogie Nights standout is Burt Reynolds as a mysterious but whimsical film director. In a scene where the young guy is attacking his films, it is a total shock for the audience because he was quite pleased and satisfied before that point. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg, who brings his career to life. Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie using common themes, but it shoots in a sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach fully describes these characters at a time when nothing was wrong, or at least until the 1980s. From that moment on, things really get dark and all the signs of recognizable characters and situations from the first part of the movie disappeared. However, this does not mean reducing the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers. Boogie Nights wasn't successful at the box office, earning only Â£ 2 million in cinemas in the UK. But this is not a film or a director's interest. Anderson recognizes quality, not popularity, which is evident from his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a simple parable filled with excellent and changeable situations, because at the end of this movie you realize that Boogie Nights is a simple moral story, but one that stays in mind for days after you watch it. Boogie Nights is instantly shocking, cheerful, devastating and visually and audibly outstanding.
