I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, I thought it would be a typical crap right on the video monster, but it turned out much better than expected. There is really no criticism to say about it ... it's probably a low budget, but it just adds to the cheesy old-fashioned fun. It's very cool and fun. There's everything: horror, sex, a big air accident and good characters. I'd say it's pretty original, because it doesn't really look like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look, which I like very much, so this film deserves credit. I look forward to seeing more of these amazing movies from "The Scare Master", Brett Piper, whom I've never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is truly creative with the music it plays. so it's perfect just to keep it when you're not ready to sit and look at it. It also includes some special features that are really interesting. But we never get to the director, nor do we hear him in the commentary, he must be shy. It comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend that all horror enthusiasts will love you!
