Fascinating and entertainingly bad, Lights of New York is the first feature film and one that almost never saw the light of day. Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from the city get involved with smugglers and end up fronting to talk. When a policeman is shot by one of the smugglers, the police start to close and Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to pin Eddie's assassin's order to take him on the road. But he's a Hawk himself, who takes a bullet in a curve that will surprise little. One week shooting at $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally intended as two reels, but Foy used Jack Warner's Absence to extend it to six. When Warner discovered it, Foya was ordered to cut it back to its original. Only when the independent exhibitor offered $ 25,000 for the film, did Warners really look at the movie, which continued to stagger $ 1.3 million. Looking at this, it is an extremely hockey stunt, with gaming, ranges from open air (Eugene Pallette) to trance as (Eddie's grandmother in a particularly risky scene) and much of the playing is at the vaudeville level. Because it's a premature talkie (4 part-talkies preceded), it's about all the characters and very slowly. The script feels improvised, the visual style does not exist (except for the silhouette of the shooting scene) and the scenes are constantly intertwined. Title cards are intercut that redundantly announce characters and locales. Despite all these "Lights" is a compelling experience when we watch actors and crews wrestling with alien technology and changing cinema forever. /> <br /> If possible, grab it
