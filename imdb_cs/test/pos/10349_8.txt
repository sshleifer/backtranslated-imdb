Recovery is a well-rated and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not testify to the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore complex and contradictory emotions of a couple deeply in love, trying to cope with the changes of personality they both endure and also survive a tragic accident. Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and dangerous durability when an engineer recovers from a memory loss caused by a road accident. Alan is not only shown as a victim, but as a human being with feelings that does the best he can do for his new life. Tricia Sarah Parish is not a household cliche who will do anything to support her husband. She struggles with falling out of love with Alan, because the man who once new and loves is now a completely different person - a stranger to her. Unlike some opinions, in my opinion, it does. perfect watching Sunday night. Too often we see soft family dramas or detective series like Heartbeat, which rot and rot the brain. Program Commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also the day when our mind sleeps. A more challenging and provocative drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation.
