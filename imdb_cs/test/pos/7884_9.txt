Even though I saw this movie about four years ago long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now, which is unusual for me, because before I often looked at it, I noticed it. What can I say? The best performance is that later Peter Boyle as the title character who learned that a man killed his drug-dealing friend wants to contact him, even though he is a manager of Madison Avenue who has nothing to do with very lower conservative conservative Joe. In fact, there is a lot of funny Joe scenes on this side of the guy doing smart alecky notes there. And it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter they are looking for after they disappear from the hospital after an overdose of some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon, who debuts in the film! This was a pretty hard movie for the time it was made (late '1960s-early' 70s) and was a compelling work from screenwriter Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later to do Save Tiger, Rocky and Karate Kid ). After all, after all these years, packing! Highly recommended for anyone who is curious about the counter-culture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are Raggedy Ann's doll, a box of Ritz cookies, a bottle of Heinz's ketchup, and a unique Nixon poster for that era, asking, "Would you buy a used car from this man?"
