There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again and I actually got a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its outside public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy of the company called Flashbacks and its pretty good. In ancient times, I watched him on black and white television and his magic seen in color. Much better than someone would trust you. The songs are beautiful and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are very well developed, which is special in animated films. I loved Hoppits and villain Mr. Beatle is a real cadre. It's incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects such as cotton reels, old cans become part of the environment and have new features is great. The anthropomorphic use of insects is amazing given that most people who are sinister think they are disgusting. Hopefully we can never re-enter the insect again! The enemy of insects is human. In fact, of course, his insects that survive. No matter how hard we try to get rid of ants in Australia, they're coming back. The battle has been lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, like when Hoppity and Mr. Bumble are caught in a watering can, a great flood and a trip to the top of the building are wonderful. Its also rather anthropomorphic, but in a way that is charming. Human characters look like you in Gulliver and their incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. His crime this film was not celebrated as a classic. The only unpleasant comment for me is the opportunity in the movie when the characters slip into the verse. The talking verse spoils the narrative and there was no need, the verse is terrible and spoils another wise good script. Its great and kids will love it. It's a pleasure to see. It's also a very clever ending.
