Ben Marshall, a religious teenager, is informed about his financial situation at home by his native mother Laura. He suggests that he find a temporary job to contribute to the household. In fact, the family took the widower to meet them. Robert Marshall, father, is a pastor in the local church; he would rather be in the country to watch the birds than to care for the souls entrusted to his church. Ben's role is older actress Evie Walton who wants her to do things for her. around the house. "Dame" Evie, as she says, is a woman of a certain age whose career may have died because she wasn't that big. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but forgotten about it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that she is dying just to forget it comfortably later on when she gets clean. Apparently Ben is more astonished than his employer's life personalities. Takes driving lessons. Evie asks him to go on a trip that is against his better judgment. He knows it will provoke his mother's anger. Not satisfied with Evie's decision to go to Edinburgh where she was invited to read at an art festival. It is a path that strengthens their bond. Ben meets and tastes meat pleasures with likeable Bryonym. When Ben returns, everything falls apart at home. His mother, who has an affair with the parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of a young man with whom he has an affair. The relationship between Ben and Evie survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. Jeremy Brock, writer of "Driving Lessons" and other unforgettable English films, is dedicated to this engaging comedy with his first directorial work. The blend of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, are explored in his screen processing making it a fun time in movies. We saw a similar situation as in "Billy Elliott", where Julie Walters plays a caring role with a younger man. We read a film that was based on Mr. Brock's own experience working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. He always adds. Mrs. Walters is a welcome presence in any movie that appears and does wonders with her false "dame". Laura Linney, the light player in her own right, doesn't have enough good sympathy for the ice mother. Rupert Grint, known for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, a young man who sees a kind soul in Evie. Nicholas Farrell is a betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role to shine.
