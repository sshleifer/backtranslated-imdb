I'm not one who likes those Anime cartoons (eg Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto) but Zatch Bell is different in my opinion. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters, and doesn't focus so much on some sort of weapon or Mamodo, As well as the episodes that I saw, such as the episode "Big Brother Kanchome", "Zatch vs. Kiyo" .Zatch Bell really focuses on the Life of the Strange Zatch, Smart Kiyo, Clueless Suzy, and WeIrD Ponygon. Cartoon for now, but I encourage others to watch 1 episode, you'll most likely will like it! Robbie H. (aka Vectorman)
