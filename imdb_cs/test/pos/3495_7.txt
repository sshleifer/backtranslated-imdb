Anyone who has already seen Ali G should be well prepared for the whole film, which is "Ali G Indahouse" <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when talking to rich and famous, his brand outside The wall of comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too. Ridiculous conspiracy, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous scenario that all make this film a rebellion for Ali G fans. it is certainly more than the same; for everyone else - watch Aiiii! 7/10
