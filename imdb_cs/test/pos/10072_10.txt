If you like Madonna or not, this movie is merry !! I am a Madonna fan and I saw it in the theater at the time of its release. But over time she didn't lose her stupidity and pure fun. Sure, there are some bad lines and cheesy playing, but the whole movie is just a comedy screwdriver with Madonna actually carrying the whole movie with a big bombast. She is cute, fun and is the only comedy role in her film career. Usually, Madonna just plays herself in roles, but watches her as Nikki Finn in this movie, it seems that someone else is once. The film is, of course, director James Foley (who shot a dramatic and haunted "At Close Range" with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken) and teammates Griffin Dunn ("After Hours"), who is also great and entertained. material. The story is nothing brilliant and do not expect any climatic ending, but if you are ever in the mood to watch fun, purity, eighties, or if you are a Madonna fan, it MUST BE LISTENED. The soundtrack is also very noteworthy and contains 4 Madonna's songs: hit # 1 "Who's the Girl", # 2 hit "Causing the Fuss" and beautiful and one of her best ballads "The Look of Love". 10 hits in the UK and "Can't Stop" left of pop ditty from "True BLue" sessions a year ago, but only on VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
