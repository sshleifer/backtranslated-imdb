OK .. you have to settle down! This movie isn't so bad. I saw it for the first time in the night and I fell in love with it! I have to admit I've never been a LeeLee Sobieski fan, but she grew up in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is good looking, but c'mon .. Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I've ever seen !!! The movie made me better. C'mon girls .. when she doesn't have a shirt and goes to get water I know your mouth has dropped. Yes, at the beginning I know he's a jerk, but in the end he realizes how he was acting and learning to be a great guy. If he wasn't in the end ... then I'd be angry. I think a few lines might not have been said, but it was a great movie in everything! Definitely recommend it!
