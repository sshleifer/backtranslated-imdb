I think this short TV series was absolutely amazing and gave both a deep and clear explanation of everything that was on screen at any given time. This was by far David Attenborough. I personally thought it was one of the best documentaries in the last decade. It is definitely worth the money of the people! I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water, the most interesting and interesting part. It was incredible to discover that the Blue Planet team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! In this document Attemborough almost certainly lived up to his high reputation. This was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentary films <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the Blue Planet team.
