If you are in the midst of a wild war and it is still not clear that you will come to the top, the things that interest you are to keep the morale of civilians ... demonstrating that our soldiers have bravery, ingenuity, and determination to overcome all the chances in a noble case. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith gave the British a 1943 movie of the Naval War, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's no wonder that some movies are dated. This does not help that class stereotypes that help to define non-commissioned officers from officers can be unpleasant. Here, as in many other British war films, men always have strong regional working class accents, while officers speak with educated fluency that would place them at home in the finest English facilities of the ruling class. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), captain of the Sea Tiger submarine, is smart, confident, resourceful, aggressive, under control, good with his men, funny with his peers, quickly decide. And it helps to be lucky. His men are cheerful, mostly competent in their work and always ready for a joke when things are straining. Even if we spend the first third of the film to get to know these people when they're on vacation, things are fast straining. Taylor and his NCOs are forced to destroy the new German battleship Brandenburg. They simply miss a boat when they enter the Kiel Canal and head for the Baltic Sea. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that the sea tiger will go after him, through minefields, antisublets, and the real risk of not having enough fuel to return to their home base. After a few tense situations, confrontation occurs. The sea tiger releases six torpedoes, but has to dive without knowing if it did. After a clever subterfuge, Taylor outfoxes a pair of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. He intends to free his part and give up when, at the very last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who was annoying and lonely and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that was fueling the warehouse. He thinks it can be for the Germans. The last third of the film is an exciting action sequence as a crew of partial attempts to hold back the German long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. It's a war propaganda film, so don't expect it to fail. And actually the sea tiger put Brandenburg down? Are men united with their wives and pets? Did Hobson have reconciliation with his wife and little son, who let him smile once? Finally, did Freddie Taylor have the chance to use all the women's names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. There are war propaganda movies and there are war propaganda movies. Some, such as Powell and Pressburger, one of our aircraft is missing and the 49th parallel, still stands to this day because the stories are solid and unexpected, and the creators have not used the obvious shortened clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough cliché that when we watched we had to remember how awful the time the movie was made. But Asquith can build a lot of tension with a few clichés. The naval tiger, who forced his way through the subnets, was tense. The Brandenburg stalking and conspiracy needed to launch the torpedo was realistic; John Mille's unreasonable attitude as he was ready to attack was well mastered. False preparations for the sea tiger to appear to have been destroyed by deep charges were as realistic as both inside and out, as you might have hoped, and the battle for the fuel storage was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it's a good example of its kind and time. John Mills, it is worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the 1950s he played in a series of serious films that looked back on these WWII days. He was of such quality that he could show hilariousness and perseverance, but a man who was also credible could be proud of how he fought in the war. The top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a gentle actor with a unique voice and the ability to give looks so cold that you would like to put on a sweater. Each on the sub is a very joke but tough-top-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman worked together on this movie.
