Unlike some movies that you can think about and do other things, this movie kept me in front of the screen for two hours. I loved every minute of it. But I must say that the story is not very believable. Especially when a stranger was expelled by the government, and then sent a package to the boy who helped him. Xiao Liu is a very good actor, showing his emotions and showing his stupidity and his love for the girl.
