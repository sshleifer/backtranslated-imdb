If you're looking for a movie that's not taken seriously ... than Haggard is for you. I have to say that before I write anything more that if you haven't seen any of the CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos before the movie most likely won't be AS funny. My advice is to watch a few clips from the videos Bam and his friends made. Haggard is not taken seriously, and that has never been the goal. During the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the storyline, which can be unpleasant but its nothing out of control. Even though the plot remains focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character is developing pretty nicely. This plot, which I was told, is based on the real story of Ryan Dunn's former friend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the film. He has a lot of talent and knows how people laugh. He stole the movie when you asked me. Overall, I like this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness. His people from the Bam movie, it won't be normal. Haggard is filled with cheerful quotes that my friends and I have always used since the first time we saw it. I saw the movie 6-7 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar kill to new order and some techno. Don't go to a movie with high expectations, let it all unfold and judge what it is.
