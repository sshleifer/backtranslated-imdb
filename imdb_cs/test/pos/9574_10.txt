This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed harder on a lot of movies. This is because the brilliance of Best In Show is not in grotesque or one-liners, but in a sophisticated and layered verbal wit. The Improvised Dialogue is so fast that you end up laughing not at every single joke, but only until a few jokes are made, each of which disarms your senses until the jokes culminate and you can't help yourself relax. It's a well shot movie, but playing it is extraordinary. I was amazed at my first observation, but when I saw it after I learned that virtually every scene was improvised, I was impressed. It was very nice to see the comics unfold each other, put the jokes out of nowhere, and completely immerse themselves in their characters. I imagine that the golden days of the other city are such.
