After ten years, it will finally save us that our Belgian action star is back again. I personally found this to be even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it his best film in ... 10 years !! Well, it's not like his high years like Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best effort: Hard Target (one of the best action movies of one of the best action directors John Woo.) The action is good, the story is exciting, dialogue is pretty funny, this is better than expected. The evil boys are amazing as in Hard Target and the fighting scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I have to say I gave it up, but Van Damme is finally back. More please ....
