Best Batman's film 90 years no doubt. This film takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares. Although rascals are somewhat kitschy, they fit perfectly in the tone of a colorful but horrible film. The performances are really great and the comic notes behind them really bring expectations. Don't be fooled by the cheesy outfit, it's a Burton-style movie. This cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who has taken the Batman series to another dark level, but has not forgotten the past of comics. Recommended for action movie fans and the best of all when dealing with superheroes.
