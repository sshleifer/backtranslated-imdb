RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) It seems to me that this is a very risky idea to try a 1955 Hollywood remake of the classic RIFIFI by Jules Dassin. will play a leading role in the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky trades ... How do they pull it away? Ironically, Dassin was on Hollywood's Hollywood list and continued his attempt at happiness in France. Grandpa from all the movies about the band and the ruse. In my opinion, it remains a unique classic, beautifully shot with one of the most memorable endings ever made on film. No matter what the view of the film is. <br /> <br /> In the last few years, RIFIFI has become dangerously overcrowded. However, this French noir-classic should not be forgotten. Go see it before it's a remake outside to have some ammo to compare both. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
