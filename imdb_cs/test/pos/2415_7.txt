Another "good overcoming bad" story, but with a difference. This includes learning self-discipline. When Julie goes with her teacher to the Zen monastery, she learns about herself. She also hones her karate skills. <br /> <br /> When Zen monks visit the city, some unpleasant and comic moments follow. It's not rude, but fun. Another Karate Kid has something to say about looking inside and improving what's there - as well as using what you have.
