"Hey, I didn't order any cabin!" "Yeah, well, you got one ..." What can I say about Hack ... what a man among men. He was an encouraging former cop who turned to a driver with a heart of gold. If you have been able (and fortunately for American television viewers ... one person a week) to penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, you must see a caring man devoted to the vigilance of justice. The show was great, I laughed, I cried, I smiled ... all in the same episode. My arms would burst into goose bumps when our dear friend Hack left his cabin in another dark alley ... with nothing more than fists ... ready to avenge himself for the evil civilian. A smile flickered on my face as the criminal in the face of the dark aisle's face flashed on his face. Week after week, I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association and basked in the warm glow of Hack's brilliance. I've never seen a better show and mourned the loss of one of America's greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I'd like to tell the world that my wife and I expect Hack Koen to come into the world in three weeks.
