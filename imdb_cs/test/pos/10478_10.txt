If not the best movie ever, "Babette Holiday" is definitely among the most loving. It is an amazing exploration of the importance of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor mixes with tender desire; the characters are treated with the search for sincerity, but also with deep respect. There are meditations about memory, fate, old age and loyalty. Amazing camera by cameraman Henning Kristiansen: rarely have wrinkles on the candlestick so bright. The food is accompanied by excellent period music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk anthems. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and spirit, for as the general says, "Mercy and truth have met, and righteousness and bliss kiss one another."
