The Ali G exhibition was really something amazing - he was such a stupid wannabe rapper, but nobody he spoke to did not notice that he was pretending. Actually, Sasha Cohen is a very intelligent person who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people ... And it's very funny. So I didn't expect the movie to be good because it was all - no real people or interviews. So the point of the whole show was lost. But I was wrong - I still laughed, it was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. Of course it was stupid, but who cares if you can't actually brake the battery like someone said? It wasn't supposed to be a realistic document ... And it's not like a show, it's totally different, but that doesn't mean it's bad. When I was finished, I was absolutely overwhelmed, but now that some time has passed, I realized that it was not so strange, but still deserved nine - at least what was to be.
