Despite later claims, this early melody has very little to do with "Citizen Kane": It's a biopus of a ruthless, but human fictional plutocrat who is told in flashback but jumps over time. The screenplay, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his later gifts for shining dialogues, and none of the innumerable "Kane" film innovations is evident. Yet it is very vigilant, with young Spencer Tracy (his ancient makeup makes him look exactly like old Spencer Tracy), who shows depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a bit behind her first work, and not physically well paired - playing a diverse woman behind man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in film history, sending the last third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. Surviving print is nervous and missing sound snippets and there are some holes that remain open (how would she know who the son was if she slept with both?), And the music is terribly hockey. I was quite fascinated for it all.
