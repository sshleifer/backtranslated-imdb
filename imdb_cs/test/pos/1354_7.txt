If Sicily is the Baroque territory, its doubling of perspective is part of the challenge of this film to realism. And it's a great pleasure to overcome Fellini's with not one but three film directors, plus of course the real Bellocchio, who has made some great movies and shouldn't touch his honor. There are many possibilities and improvisations for Manzoni's "I promessi sposi" with the various places where real marriage is located. Sicily is also considered to be a skuldugger territory (you already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler) whose comic version makes a picture worth seeing the work of Sergio Castellito with guard dogs on the floor of the grand palazzo.
