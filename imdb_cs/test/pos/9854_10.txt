This documentary is not only one of the best movies I've seen, but also one of the most moving and quietest movies I've ever seen. It follows the life of two Sudanese young men, Peter and Santino, who are trying to break into American culture. Peter and Santino are initially friends, but gradually they move more and more apart because Peter goes to Kansas City and Santino stays in Houston ("a country called Houston"). Santino has beauty in her eyes. Taking people back, supporting an apartment full of other Sudanese, paying rent, doing everything for other people. He's a quiet sufferer. Peter looks at himself, gains high school and plays basketball and makes Christian friends. Director Megan Mylan does not seem to know what she has done with the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are amazing characters that push you. But the real strength of this film lies in its commentary on American society. It's not a judgment. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how hard it can be for outside people. I suggest you find this movie and look at America's lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10/10
