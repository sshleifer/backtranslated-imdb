I remember going home from school almost every day to capture 5 KTLA monster channels, but I never ran faster than when this movie was planned. The idea of ​​being a boy and a giant robot as a friend addressed me in some way. Sure, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko. I haven't seen this movie in 30 years and I still remember it live. Who can forget how Giant Robot fired rockets from his fingers! Or how Ghuillotene threw his nails to explode! Geez, I still have a whistle that plays in the end, which is so tragic that I remember how I slept several times! Only one other film has this kind of magic, this film does in my mind, and it's the Wizard of Oz. But I've seen the movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, Oz Wizard is a real classic, while Voyage Into Space is a low budget nonsense. These two films should not be mentioned in the same sentence, but young boys are not of high production value or continuity that captures your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin uses a very precise impression of a giant robot (he said it was a "giant Robutt.") If you remember, the giant robot had a special way to shoot his rockets and my cousin had cooled down. I did it to repeat my routine for my personal amusement.
