Elmer is again faced with the dilemma of who is shooting. Daffy's mistakes. He is not sure what season he is and Bunny and Duck argue that it doesn't matter. Although Bugs proves to be the smartest one again, he repeatedly uses reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when it runs out, it makes its trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy spreads and requires the bunny to be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with a girl. Elmer is really to blame for it. If he weren't so stupid, he would know it was really a duck season and just a Daffy blast. But poor Daff can't believe the absolute absurdity of the situation. His cruel mismanagement plans were thwarted by Elmer's confusion. Daffy is so shocked that he will even return home with Elmer to be thrown into the living room. Poor Daff. True!
