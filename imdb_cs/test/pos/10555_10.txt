I think it's a great and very funny movie. The story is so fun. Nicole's daughter brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing situations In an effort to impress the boy from her dreams, the daughter pretends her father is her lover. Just see! Heigl is beautiful as Nicole, maybe too beautiful; I'm not sure why she would have to lie to hang someone? Gerard Depardieu In this comedy movie, he works very well, he's so funny to watch. If you like comedy and romantic movie, you have to see it !!! I think you can see this movie many times and you will always have a good laugh. In an effort to impress the boys of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.
