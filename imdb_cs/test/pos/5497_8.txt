Clint Eastwood has been a great success in this thriller since 1993. In collaboration with the absolute master of your tension, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood is doing as he can. Also John Malkovich goes to my list of the most effective movie thieves in the history of cinema as Rement Russo as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said best when he said, referring to his own career, "I'm getting old and my senior ladies are getting younger ". A very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should work together. Top film.
