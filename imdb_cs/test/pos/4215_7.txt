I will be honest, I rented this film only on the grounds that it was part of the "Children Play" series. I was expecting a boring boring part four, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good and I found it pretty funny. There was a lot of dark humor and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to spice things up. Two dolls worked together and added the type of Bonnie and Clyde to the movie. Overall, it was very good for the 4th movie in the series, with some creepy death scenes (just watching the marilyn manson type get killed in the beginning, not to mention John ritter getting a face full of nails). He pleases the writer for it to cool down and end, even though I find it a little weird, leaving room for yet another sequel ... maybe "son of chuck" !!!
