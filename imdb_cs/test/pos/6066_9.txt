We just watched the last of the series on the SBS network and we miss a weekly dose of Danish pleasure. My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" ended and it seemed to be a very bad substitute for our favorite TV show. But a week after a week, the show grew up on me, and although not as shiny as a Swedish show, and certainly more unobtrusive in their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly meal. In fact, before these two shows, I wasn't really a fan of the cops genre, and I can't say I'm right now, but two Scandinavian shows really gave us insight into life in these northern European countries. police units.
