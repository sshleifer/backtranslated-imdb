In Manhattan, I have described Woody Allen that this is perfect for someone, and she thought it was a strange way to describe the movie ... <br /> <br /> I saw only a few movies I would call perfect. Manhattan's One, McCabe and Mrs. Miller Robert Altman is Another and Once Upon a Time in the West Sergio Leone is also another movie that I think achieves perfection. There are several others, but in addition to not finding any mistakes in the three I mentioned, I also have to admit that all three directors have gained taste. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie I could Stand up and bet on a house that would show you that it would be flawless, it's a shoulder shoulder. The City of Light, the Great Dictator, the Golden Rush and even the Pawnshop are 10, but not just Chaplin Do everything in this movie, everything he's done is happy and touches a level that is beyond explanation.
