The combination of amazing special effects and Oscar-winning acting makes Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. For some reason that has not yet been known to me, this gem was found in a negotiating basket, why some worthless people thought it was good to stain modern classics by getting into a negotiating basket. I've never been so scared by a man in a tin foil and a random fire. Forget Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other movies that have shaken this masterpiece, a revenge is an unstoppable force.
