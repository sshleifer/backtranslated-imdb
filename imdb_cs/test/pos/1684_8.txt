Over the years, films have been appearing that are barely shifting. Choose Conner is one of those movies. This little gem played at some festivals and had a short 2 week run at a small theater in West Hollywood. 5500. <br /> <br /> Now on DVD, I hope it will see a lot more. It is a strange drama of a clever young politician who affects a very bright 15-year-old boy. The above paragraph is somewhat unclear about what's going on, SO's a movie, & that's what I appreciated, we won't get all the facts, a lot is left to our own thinking. You will hear a dialogue that does this logic. Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is somewhat vague, that is another point for viewers to think <br /> <br /> Alex D.Linz is our 15 year old, he He was about 17 when they did this movie, but could easily pass for the younger. He was in movies and television because he was a small child, he is a very good actor and he is quite convincing. Escher Holloway is an older teenager, this role is his first major part & he too is excellent. Now I'm saving the best of the last, writer / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For the first effort big thumb up. I hope that, like our 2 guys, they have a long career. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (of 4) 86 points (of 100) IMDb 8 (of 10)
