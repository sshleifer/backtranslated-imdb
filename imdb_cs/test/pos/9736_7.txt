I was a child when I saw this show, a bit after I saw Buck Rogers, both characters of the same Buster Crabbe, and I have to admit that these movies have always been part of the best fun I've ever had. But the fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I wondered how the fate of the love triangle with Dale and Aura was. Barin came and convinced Aura to forget Flash, a very innocent ending of her obsession for a good looking Flash. The series has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all viewers. The other thing is that I learned to float in the water and look like Crabbe did when fighting sharks. The soundtrack was also nice, though it was previously used in another movie by Frankenstein by Boris Karloff. It would be nice to have a DVD of this series provided it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
