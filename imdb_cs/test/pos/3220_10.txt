is the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I love them! I look at it every day! I have episodes from the internet! 6 seasons are broadcast here in Romania! I'm glad I saw the show from the beginning and I'm glad to see 7 seasons over the internet. Until now, Season 5 is my favorite: D I love it because Logan appears and the scene where to jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I want Lorelai to stay with Christopher because she's beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen. I really want a DVD, but I think it never appears here in Romania because I don't think they even know they have fans. But no matter what, I'll watch it. Goodbye!!
