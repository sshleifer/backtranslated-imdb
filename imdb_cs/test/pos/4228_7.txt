The children's game series is not my favorite, but Bride Of Chucky is actually a good movie. This time we have two Chucky dolls and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are several interesting scenes across the movie as a guy getting hit by a truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the end that allows another sequel to take place. It wasn't really straightforward horror, she mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of spoof of the horror genre. This made the film better as a comedy does with many horror movies. Everything up, though it's not your kid's fan to play this one go.
