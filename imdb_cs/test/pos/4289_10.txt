Can the intensity of her husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up the crime, despite treason at many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello, in today's England. A network of fraud is gradually weaving. And we are witnessing cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of "separated lies" begins to fail and then clings together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the clear flame of husband's love and deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. How many scam websites should be displayed in this growing tapestry? The stimulus is to encourage reputation and career and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives emotional performance, full of grace and discretion and decency, yet humanity to those who are to hide a lot. Those who want clarity and openness on the road to justice will be disappointed with the wickedness of so many frauds. And yet, who has no such thing among us as he would hide from his loved ones? However, the viewer may wonder if this site will fall apart one day.
