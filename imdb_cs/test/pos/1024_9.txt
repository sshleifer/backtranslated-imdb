Postwar England, the dawn of "atomic age". However, the concern of a young schoolboy eager to experience his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as insignificant as the BOMB. This was a wonderful, if not educational, look at young love from the perspective of a young man and his world in the forties. This film without political correctness and the message of sermon exposes the viewer to a world that can only create the mind (and <br /> <br /> hormones) of a young teenager. Beautiful subplots <br /> <br /> retain the character of interest ala "Gregory's girl", and plenty of <br /> <br /> well-blocked shots to help keep the image at this time. This is a very good story for everyone, young or old, who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be. Does he ever have a wish? Watch it and see.
