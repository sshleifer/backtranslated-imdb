An interesting accompaniment to the real documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it does not deal with what eventually killed Holmes, and he could certainly benefit from it. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg received the greatest praise for this, but I felt that the real stars were Julianne Moore, who acts as a cocaine-sniffing mother, Don Cheadle as a black man fighting with identity as a porn star / stereotype in some wild getups and William H. Macy, who's wife, is the ultimate slut. Not to mention the almost unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy's New Year Eve Bash and Cheadle Chances for a Better Life After Grasshopper Shop Robberies Wildly Wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least two of the best shot. What this film does best is to show how much it can easily corrupt in different forms. However, none of the characters seem to know anything from their dark downward spiral when they all bounce back and return to their normal life.
