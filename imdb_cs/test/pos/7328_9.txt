I can't say the film deserves ten because I would lie. Even though I saw it, I loved this movie! It bears a unique bond of friendship between teenager and dolphin. Although the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had at Willy, does not show up, it provides an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love sea animals or if u love just the perfect family movie, this movie is suitable for you! Flipper certainly shows us how cute dolphins are and are playful and could easily be pets if everyone had a big pool! I love whales and dolphins, so this movie seems to work for me. I think manufacturers should choose another shark instead of a hammer to increase the opponent's share in the story. Perhaps great white? FLIPPER IS A MAGNIFICENT! So look!
