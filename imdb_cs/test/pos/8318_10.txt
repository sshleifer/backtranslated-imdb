Walking with Dinosaurs is an amazing document, educational for both ignorant dinosaurs and dinosaurs-lovers (like me) alike. I admit I was very young when I saw it on Discovery, but I was obsessed immediately. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, going from the late Triassic when dinosaurs were only first evolving to the late Cretaceous, at the end of the dinosaur reign. When I first saw this movie, it was like I was traveling in time. The Majesty of Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus, and the caring mother of the T-Rex version all stunned my family and me. It's a great movie and I believe the BBC has done exactly what they have decided to do. Amazing work!
