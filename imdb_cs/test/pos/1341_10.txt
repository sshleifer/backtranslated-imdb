When I was five, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 14:00 every day. The idea of ​​the show was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostess of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories like children. It was made in the studio with only 54 episodes that were re-broadcasting again and again. I remember Sherlock, a puppet, on a tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and alphabet. In thirty minutes a day I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember those days as pleasant memories, and now I hope that today's children can learn to love simpler things like stories, cheap props, swinging and puppet talking. The set was ideal and simple, but Carole and Janis, who did it for enjoying it. I miss my childhood and those days when it was most important to watch the magic of the garden. Life looked much easier and better. I hope the kids enjoy the show today.
