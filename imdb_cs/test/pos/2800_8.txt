"L'Auberge Espagnole" gathered the audience everywhere it was shown. She has won audiences at many film festivals around the world. And it's not weird. We have the ability to watch merry and amazing art. By the way, it's wise. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very fun comedy about youth and adolescence. But above all it is about the lights and shadow of life in the European Union. The film's main character is Xavier, a French economist. His future carrier is sent to Barcelona for one year of study. In Spain, it appears that the lectures are in Catalan. This probably does not help increase knowledge. However, it helps tighten relations within a group of foreign exchange students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French guy will also get there. The year is a very long time. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some of the European stereotypes in trying to divide them. The writings approach this particular case of the unification of Europe with humor and without stone didactism. It is based on the idea that young people are the same everywhere. They like jokes. They like to do irresponsible relationships. But they do not neglect their desires. The most interesting is the summary of the experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans are returning to their countries to learn the life of an adult. They are Europe's hopes for combating many of the Union's problems. For example, a scary management system. Finally, they prove that they can not only communicate and make friends despite many differences. But also now, how to live to the fullest. And they won't let them give up their lives.
