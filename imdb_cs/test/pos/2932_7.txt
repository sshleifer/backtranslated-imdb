I mean, let's get it, all you have to do in modeling is a pose for photos. Judging is on top with criticism. The show however is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and Supermodel himself Twiggy. I watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. Looks like the American idol went sexy, but I'm a guy and I'm just watching him for hot girls in their bikini! The show can be quite boring when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on and it's really off-putting. Anyway, would I recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to go into the modeling business? No.
