"Why are there so many songs about the rainbow and what's on the other side?" Kermit presents this relatively simple double question near the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" while singing "The Rainbow Connection". As time goes by, the question and the film get a deeper look. I'm going to give up reviewing this movie as a children's comedy, but instead it's like a classic for every generation. love with serious ideals and a pleasing message that gets more heat each year. As milestones in my life appear on me, I hear more and more evocative tribes of this elementary ditty. , and realize that it can fit into the soundtrack to something life because we all dream. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of puppets - it's a lot of puppets that have the power to watch their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. And while the humor and gaiety of the film always feels good, they are not just a movie judge. Only "Rainbow Connections" and strong emotions they realize. And all this fits into: "Rainbow Connection" * is * Muppet Movie and vice versa. It's existentialism encounters children's entertainment - it's not an easier way to describe it.
