Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was a show in theaters across Russia as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of West Germany. I felt I had to check. It was excellent! The camera was beautiful and incredible. I do not regret watching this movie and adding it to my collection.
