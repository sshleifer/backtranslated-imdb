In Europe and Asia. Kurdish dirges represented by Aynur, who performs her own brand of Kurdish Gospel music, passionate and melodic. We are introduced to Romany instrumentals, Orhan Gencebay, called Elvis of Arabic Music - the sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city, as Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street performers and recording. German bassist Alexander Hacke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish Confucius music quotes, "To understand the place you have to listen to the music he plays." Akin's brilliant documentary film makes it - he gives us 90 minutes of music that helps bridges. Watching the movie was especially interesting to me because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my vacation and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its paintings, colors, crowds, liveliness and visual beauty. Now I can add music sounds to the ever-changing picture of Istanbul.
