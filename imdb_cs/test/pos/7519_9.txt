If you like Paddy Chayevsky's "Network" you'll probably like this black comedy as well, as it's another brilliant Chayevsky script, wonderful satire at the big city hospitals and the perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays a burnt-out chief of medicine on her more chaotic day he or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis comes to his head, and his hospitals fall around him as the locals demonstrate against the hospital, and patients and doctors die at an alarming rate, thanks to a biblically inspired and murderous saboteur. One who claims to be a "fool for Christ", "Parakleet of Kaborka", "Anger of the Lamb" and "Angel of the Bottom Pit", bops doctors on the head, administers lethal injections and exchanges patient identities. , causing treatment and surgery to be performed on the wrong person. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable because deadly mistakes like these are happening (perhaps not so much, not so often and not in one place) and make you laugh at invaluable portraits of characters. One of them is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and publicly traded shares than about his patients who suffer fatally from his huge indifference and neglect. There is Diana Rigg as a free-spirited, hippie-ish Barbara Drummond who seduces an enthusiastic chief of medicine (Scott) and tries to get him to escape with her. Then there is a deceived murderer who happens to be Barbara's father and who "works pretty well" back to an Indian reservation where she lives with her daughter and even runs a clinic, but who pushed them into madness just by being back in civilization. The strongest portrait by far is Scott's Bock, who exposes his soul as a former genius, a failed father and husband, a brilliant physician and a responsible administrator who constantly dreams of suicide, but must bear the demands of his work. Scott is exceptional in this challenging role. Until the final scenes, Bock leaves the hospital behind Barbar's Indian Reservation and a quieter, simpler life, whether her murderous father is caught or whether the protesters, riots, local residents, and bring the hospital to their knees. One of the Khayevsky suspects, watching a crazy killer at work, tells us that our crazy society is doing these things, telling us that it is another person far from cities and people. As my father, he was the chief administrator of a number of major hospitals, and over the years I had some idea of ​​the demands of his work and the huge responsibility he wore. This story is responsible for what Scott's crisis is about. This is both a funny and scary movie, with actors up to considerable demands on the Khayevsky script. It's also a movie I get every time I watch it.
