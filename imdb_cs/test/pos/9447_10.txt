She's the funniest movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard that I cried. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely amazing and can really act. It certainly doesn't hurt to have a few hairless scenes. Channing and Amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely amazing. I love this movie. Be sure to watch the last deleted scene while watching. It was a huge mistake to cut this scene because it's one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been fun. And Channing will be a huge star. This is just the first of many for this bright new star.
