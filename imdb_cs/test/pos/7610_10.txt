I thought this movie was really amazing! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I'd like to watch this movie over and over again if I could. I also loved the end. This film clearly showed a smile on his face! I was also surprised to find James Franco and Jessica Alba in it. I love them both, so I also emphasized this movie. In the end, when Drew makes a huge note about the truth, it really told the truth about what happens sometimes in high school. The movie was amazing again. Defensive 10/10. I hope this comment was very useful for all IMDb readers.
