I just want to tell you a few things before looking at this movie. If you thought you saw a good camera work in one place or another, be prepared to be amazed at this movie. To record, this film was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something we saw much later in the Western world ... about 20 years later. The degree of emotion over the film is very different: happiness - love-war-despair-joy, but in the end you will remain with something quite unique: the joy of one masterpiece of filmmaking. Young directors of our time should study more of these films and maybe be able to create something like that ... though I think movies like this are very hard to come ... If you've seen "I'm Cuba" then this movie "The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and the joy of creating art ... and yes, they are able to create more masterpieces than the entire Western world together I'm not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate everything that is a Communist, but filmmaking in this part of the world can create feelings that are hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <Br /> <br />
