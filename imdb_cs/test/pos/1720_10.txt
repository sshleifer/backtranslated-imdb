I love pop culture, but when I first heard about it, I was a little dreaded. Then I saw an episode and I love it! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson was no longer playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best they had. The character fits so well. It's sad to see him. I really don't think the new guy is going to rip the doctor out just like Eccelson. I think everyone can overlook cheesy effects in some places and creatures like darleks. Rows of stories and characters can do more than make up for it. I am currently waiting for the second season and will review that even if for some reason the quality is falling. Anyway, I think everyone should try to see one episode. I've loved it ever since. Well written, well cast and well made, this exhibition is worth an hour of watching. Doctor Who Gets 10/10
