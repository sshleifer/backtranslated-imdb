I remember seeing it in theaters when it came out, I have no idea what it will be and will be so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it came out. Although I'm not too far into the autopsy of this movie, I'll say I gave it 8/10, for all the reasons why you can read other users' reviews. <br /> <br /> What I say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's as close to how I saw it as possible. I once gave this movie to a party where everyone was downloading and going to leave. I just wanted to see what happened when I showed them the first ten minutes. Everyone who watched the opening stayed at the end.
