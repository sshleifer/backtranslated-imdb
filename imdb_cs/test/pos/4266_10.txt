It's a movie that anyone who lives in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political unrest that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. This presents interviews with those who have been condemned, where these people get a first chance after the riots to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a much better place to live and be part of it. I react sensitively when I see it because I feel so pissed at how these people were treated during both the riots and the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will see as much as it really gets your mind thinking: Is it possible? In Sweden, Democracy, in 2001?
