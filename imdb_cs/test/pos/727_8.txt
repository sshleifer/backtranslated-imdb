A raw, nervous thriller that led to great philosophical heights he couldn't quite achieve. I enjoyed the film immensely. She had a great deal of tension and left me with the wonderful coolness of the spine I had expected from the thrillers, and that was achieved purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and gore. The soundtrack and settings added to the voltage perfectly. Sometimes it was a bit unpolished, especially acting and character development. It could only have been a better film if we knew more about the nightmares of the past that the characters would see when they closed their eyes, and why they felt that desperate need to look for an "answer" that was so integral to the story. Eventually they seemed to continue to search, even if they knew, or at least they had a clue what might happen if they found him. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are ready to look behind the stone and see the potential of the diamond in rough.
