The continuation of an exclusive film program on complicated relationships at some European courts, last night at the Schloss Theater was presented "Anna Boleyn", a film by the director of the German director Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film depicts the horrific story of Queen Consort of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the kings to do his dirty work) not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. The film features Dame Henny Porten, Germany's first superstar screen during her early years, and Herr Emil Jannings, Germany's fatest actor in this quiet era. Both play their characters in an appropriate way; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who is gradually interested in the power the court offers to her, and Mr. Jannings as a ruthless, whimsical and effeminate British monarch, a figure very suitable for this German actor who fits properly due to extravagance and excessive personality. figure alone. In the early years of the film, Mr. Lubitsch was renowned for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with great budgets ("Anna Boleyn" cost about 8 million brands, wealth for this German number) to devote great care to beautiful decors , as seen during the coronation procession in Westminster Abbey, where 4,000 add-ons were used (at that time German Germans were used, which led to the revolutionary workers creating a stir when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the ensemble during filming). Apart from a theatrical performance, one of the most important aspects of this and every Mr. Lubitsch film, even during his epic period, with a complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a variety of interests, double meanings, and complicated flirting art, but what is at first end handled in tragedy. The importance of these historical facts is given effectively, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn. Now, if you allow me, he must temporarily take my leave, because this German earl must make sure that one of his fat and rich heirs does not lose his head for this German aristocrat.
