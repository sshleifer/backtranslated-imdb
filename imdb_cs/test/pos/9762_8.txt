This is one of my favorite books and I remember watching this series and loving it immensely. Unfortunately, I never saw him repeat, nor could I get on the DVD, but I've never forgotten such an impact. Leading characters were ideal for roles, especially the beautiful Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely in line with the book at least they were there, unlike the movie version with Virginia McKen who left that part out completely. I agree that Gordon Jackson's character Strachan is completely different from the book, but is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is a Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
