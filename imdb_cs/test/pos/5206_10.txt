Simply the best and most realistic movie about World War II I've ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers speak Russian (in German or Russian dialect) also because of the realistic decoration in which the film was shot. The activity is excellent. No Hollywood-sentiment or any love story at all ... Stalingrad was to be one of the most terrible battles during the war, and in this context there is no place for sentiment or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that will inspire you with bones and have one of the best unfortunate ends a movie might have.
