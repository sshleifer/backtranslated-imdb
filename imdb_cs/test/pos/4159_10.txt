The Golden Door (NUOVOMONDO) is the most beautiful film of the year for this viewer. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this brilliantly beautiful film is a much needed mirror mirror for us so that we can see the history of immigration of foreigners to America at a time when the very word "border" is a political safeguard. The writer / director Emanuele Crialese not only gave us a deeply touching story, but also offered viewers the opportunity to visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of Native Americans, we all entered America as "aliens". â€œAt some point in our history, and it is humble to watch this movie with this fact in mind. The film opens at the turn of the century Sicily as a poor widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs a rocky hill to pass his tokens to the cross to ask if they should continue to fight for existence on the island or go to America, the country of dreams. Mancus' deaf son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the postcard postcard he found with images of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than humans, etc.), and Salvatore accepts this as a sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunat (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sister Rita (Federico De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to travel, he sells his only property (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and a man with a boat organizing their journey, giving family shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions aboard an ocean-going vessel as a third-class passenger. As the Mancuso family prepares to board, they are asked to take a photo, and as they represent behind the painted set, Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg), an Englishwoman, walks in the photo as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy can't board a ship for America without a male escort. The journey begins, and Luce identifies with her Mancusa family in her gentle way, finally firming her safe passage by suggesting Salvatore to marry her. not for love when they come to America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are terrible to the poor, a number of third-class passengers survive, bond and eventually arrive at Ellis Island, believing their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone has to go through tough physical tests, de-lousing, and even intelligence testing to see if they can enter America: officials let them know that America doesn't want to enter the new world with genetically worse people! Every woman must be chosen by a man to get married on Ellis Island before they are allowed to enter. The way the Mancusa family remains united to a somewhat surprising end is to close the story. Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment of immigrants they face (or at least face the turn of the century) on Ellis, and if we choose to delve into this information. THE GOLDEN DOORS represent a case of immigrant struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts but also challenges us to adopt applicable immigration legislation. But all the political issues aside, the GOLDEN DOORS are above all a movie of immense beauty, beautiful photography, deeply felt casting performance, and a very sensitively written and directed story. It is a film that deserves a wide distribution, a film that everyone must see. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
