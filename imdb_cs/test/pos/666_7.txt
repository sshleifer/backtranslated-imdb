This special special, PAEDO-GEDDON, which took place in BRASS EYE, was flooded with complaints (more on that later) when it was broadcast in 2001 after a national debate on a possible "Sarah Law" after the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne School. In fact, it was a time lag, while Phil Collins took legal advice after discovering that the show's creator, Chris Morris, had fooled him into a Nonce-sense launch campaign <br /> <br /> If the truth is, this the show is probably more memorized for controversy than content that is in very bad taste, but I admit I laughed loudly. The edition focuses on pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays a moderator who tells the audience that the infamous pedophile has been released into space, then admits that an eight-year-old was accidentally placed in a capsule with a pedophile. Cue scared baby screams. Just like I said a very bad appetite <br /> <br /> Other interesting things about this show include Dr. Fox, who lectures on a scientific lecture that pedophiles share an identical nervous system with crabs ("No one knows, but it's a scientific fact") Labor MEP Barbara Follet, who publicly warned the pedophile of genitalia gear, surfing the net and Kate Thornton's warning viewers that pedophiles can send gas over the internet, making small children exposed to sexual predators, including one victim "Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has a sexuality of a 60-year-old colonel." Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection group serious photos who want to know if they are classified as obscene. The photos showed Barbie surrounded by marriage aids and a composite photo representing the head of a young boy, a dog's body, and an erect penis that could only belong to John Holmes. Hey, I never said it was tasteful? It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without a hypocritical fall that would surround him, where politicians, children's organizations, and policemen hurried to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject. The show was a bad taste even though I laughed all the way through it, but it's a scathing satire. Perhaps the critics should look in the mirror for a long time, where a liberal elite allows a convicted pedophile slime to walk through Britain's streets before criticizing a mere TV show for tensions.
