I thought it was very "different" compared to Shakespeare's most modern interpretations and it was looking forward to it. It would not be useful for those who study at school, etc., because it does not show traditional Shakespearean interpretations of character (ie, Miranda is quite punk compared to your traditional Shakespearean woman), but it is very strong for understanding the game and for the story. piece and fantastic watch. It also does not include the correct format, as is the case with the act and scene layout, because I am currently playing Miranda in production and most of her lines have been cut out and some scenes have been split and mixed, but it is very useful and I definitely recommend it as you must see, even when you just say you saw it! Shakespeare fans would love it!
