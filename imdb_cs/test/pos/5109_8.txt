If you see just one Ernest movie in your life, do it! It is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughter and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. Other "Ernest" flicks were also good, but most people tend to get tired of it quickly (not ME, however.). In this film, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned a jury duty for murder. The killer, Nash, just seems to look exactly like our stunning hero Ernest. Mr. Nash found it a good opportunity to escape from prison by knocking him out of the switch identities, so we see how Ernest reacts in the gun. <br /> <br /> Great movie! If you haven't seen it yet, watch it!
