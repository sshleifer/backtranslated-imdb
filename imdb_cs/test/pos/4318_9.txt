a very good episode, though not as a devastating finale as the end of the season 1. The idea of ​​making it Desmond flashback worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps giving the best performance of this whole series, but my which felt like a subplot, and after three minutes of the previous episode, I thought it would be more. But the strength of the character and performance of the Cusicks stretched it. As always, plotting has left more questions than answers that are others, something we still don't know, and where jack, Sawyer and Kate are taken. What was the white light, what's the impact? Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? as the hatch crashed past them. If it were, it would be a big mistake, because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and Terry O'Quinn was fantastic in both series like Locke. Appropriate finals to better series than first.
