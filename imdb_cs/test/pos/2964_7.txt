A make-or-break love story for me is whether I like the characters and also if they click to each other. Matt is quite unlikely: a reserved, laudable, seemingly lazy and misogynist. He was badly injured by his broken mom, which makes him a little easier. I think I liked the details of his dysfunction - he was believable. He overloads by bragging about leaving Amy. She acts so well around Amy to hit twice. When she speaks, she can't show her who she really is. He empathizes and then robs him at the right moments. She seems to be so mature and strong that her features, which came out later, do not seem appropriate. (For me.) I find he's incredibly sexy and pretty. . . pretty girl next door, I say it. This is how I like this movie if it doesn't really go away. The coach becomes funny, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were confused. Matt carries the ball, but it seems to be blocking. People, he's not the right size! It's fifty pounds too light for this position. But I thought his actions were skillful. I measured it as I wanted to crouch his neck several times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The movie was fine. Meredith M was better than okay.
