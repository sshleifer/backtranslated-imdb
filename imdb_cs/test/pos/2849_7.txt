Renee Zellweger is totally shining like sister Betty, who is one of the most beautiful comedies of the year, one of the most beautiful and brightest. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she sets in and thinks that cast members on Reason to Love are real. She decided to travel to Los Angeles to find a specialist heart specialist, Dr. David Ravell (character at the show). As two strangely paired Hitmen, corrosive Rock and pontifting Freeman create a very entertaining fun of chemistry, Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona. Renee Zellweger turns into an innocent, sweet-coated and sometimes terribly sweet performance as Betty's sister. It radiates good, warm and irresistible. While the screenplay sometimes feels like a sit-com, it is sometimes filled with incredible characters and fictional situations, so Zellweger is so sympathetic and so completely disarming that it all meets. With a few splashing black comedies to keep things interesting, Zellweger's winning performance, great support and a competent script, Sister Betty is absolutely enjoyable. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
