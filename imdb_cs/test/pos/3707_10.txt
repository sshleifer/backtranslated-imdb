This film was created right in the area where I grew up and lives. I know most of the owners of different places in the film personally. As a teenager, I worked in fields around an isolated road that appeared in a movie with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr and the car. I was told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are natives of NC. I was lucky to see it at the local show. At that show was one of the people who helped choose the location and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the film. The bus had no reverse gear and the driver missed the stop point several times during the shooting and had to go a few miles to return to the right place. These details on technical issues have added to the enjoyment for me. The film accurately captures life in the area during World War II. Well done movie and I anxiously await DVD availability.
