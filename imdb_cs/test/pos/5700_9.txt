What a wonderful documentary - I sat down and thought it would be a rehash of those unpleasant stories told in Easy Riders, the Raging Bulls, but in fact it is clearly the eyes, the famous celebration of the strange and twisted era that has produced something really great movies. What surprised me was the lack of bitterness in the director's interviews, as the film bizarre is now in great fashion - instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola's eyes seem to glitter as they recall their days of glory. Audience footage based on the Exorcist's daily screening was invaluable. "It was - traumatic," says one guy. Big epitaph for late Ted Demme, a thrilling movie, I just wish it was longer - I could sit for three hours.
