For a movie like this little hidden gem come out in the 80s, its shocking as not many people know about it. This film is definitely worth a look. He has all the things you need for a horror movie. Particularly good old chills. I remember seeing this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I didn't remember the title, so I came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help in finding a title. I finally got the title of the title and bought the movie. I still love, just like I did all these years. <br /> <br /> buy this movie !!
