Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - baptism in fire, death from above. The excellent cast of obsessed characters managed to survive and exhale the passage of coronal matter, but that wouldn't be fun and certainly not dramatic. Variety's really lame review criticized the characters for being interested in their personal redemption instead of banning the world to save together. But what is refreshing in this great heat is that no one can do anything about it. Therefore, we are mercilessly exposed to the scenes of "heart warming" of fascist presidents and other great stators who are trying to save the selected remains of humanity (ala Deep Impact). Here pot potted and lust-powered dirty half dozen work their own redemption or face their personal oblivion of the old-fashioned way - together as individuals or ...... alone with themselves. Great TV movie ever. It is not obviously denatured by the destructive medias of overzealous Network Execs. I warmly recommend.
