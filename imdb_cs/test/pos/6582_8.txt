Imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience: gray instead of white, no snow fights and definitely no miracles. This is Finland as portrayed by 'Frozen Land'. This film follows a lot of people whose lives are strangely associated with others' results outside one's nightmares. Yes, most characters are flawed in the sense that only celluloid characters can - absolutely unpleasant and frustrated - watch, but for some reason you wish their happiness to turn. With some randomly placed humor and casting a group of Finnish somewhat mainstream faces, Frozen Land offers a view of a Finnish mentality that, despite its depressing downward spiral, can restore some belief in humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, at least.
