Dangerous psychopathic killer Jacob Goodnight is trapped in the abandoned and rotting Blackwell Hotel, alone with his nightmares, until eight adolescent offenders appear on duty along with a cop who injured Jacob four years ago. the killer and her fate uncertain, the remaining petty criminals have to fight for their lives ... "See No Evil" was directed by Gregory Dark and is the star of WWE superstar Kane as a reckless psychopath. there is no surprise here, but there is enough extreme violence and gore for slasher fans to enjoy. Overall, I liked this movie and you should also, if you're into mindless slasher flicks.Sure, it's a clich√©, but who cares. 7 of 10.
