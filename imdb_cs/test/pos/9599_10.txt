I'm not a footie fan in any way, but I've been watching it with a friend because there was nothing else in the box (thank God). Not only were we laughing from start to finish, but about a week later in the pub, when we started discussing it, we made the right spectacle with uncontrollable laughter. Does this pitched pitch really exist ??? I posted my email here, so if anyone hears about its future availability or repetition on the phone, please let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on TV !!! King Leek was good too! another classic Tim Healy
