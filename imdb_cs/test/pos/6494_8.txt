Thank God not all the Dutch are so ruthless. I think most people consider Jason to have a famous father. Maybe he's not as big as some of those actors, but he's definitely not as bad as suggested. I watched the movie a few years ago and actually loved it. I knew Jason from other films and, of course, Robin Sherwood. But I have to say that I really liked his playing from this movie. It was really good! In fact, during the movie, I forgot that he was a son. Sean ... who? And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. You will certainly like it!
