Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters ended up being the best movie I've ever seen. The person I liked in the story had to be Cassie playing Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and how she speaks with her mind. For example, when Anna calls from Cassie to answer and says, "Hi? Anna guess what. Big dad was lost, but now he's not a good man!" I loved all Sarah Plain and high movies for my reviews I think Sarah Plain and tall was # 3. Skylark was # 2. The end of winter was # 1! If I could live in any past family, it would have to be a Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie I can't name. I think they chose the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you ever wanted to watch a movie from the past, I'd highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters.
