It is a pity that the Gershwin and Goldwyn Estate family pulled out this great viewing movie, relieving the public of seeing some of the most beautiful actors and performances that have ever been packed into one movie. It is also true that the vocal voices for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge have been dubbed for this film, and this is one of the reasons why we do not want Gershwin to release this film again. Br /> <br /> In the case of film shortcomings and creative differences between Gershwins and Goldwyns, this film has some of the most spectacular performances ever on screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey deserves praise. This film was a big independent producer of Samuel Golwyn's swan. It was also ironically, Gershwin's greatest shame. Finally, it is the loss of the amazing black actors who have appeared in it. Because we can no longer see them in their best sense.
