That was a great movie. Something not only for the Black History Month, but also as a reminder of the good of people and the claim that it really takes the village to raise a child. The performance With Eptath was excellent. Mos Def and his singing were off hook. If I saw it, it was Rosie Perez. But the support of actors and actresses was worth watching. All those different stories were amazing. And how the nurse Jr and all the others who were in her presence protected. I really understand it as a matriarch of that time and even more so tired of helping everyone. I can't wait to get out on the DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any film library.
