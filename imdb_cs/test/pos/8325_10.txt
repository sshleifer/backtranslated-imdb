This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of the dinosaurs I've ever seen. 3D animations and animatronics are very good and convince you that you have traveled in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a fine series, as does Tim Haines, who had to spend a lot of time getting this series in the air.
