A very exciting, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students who flatter themselves and then resuscitate to share their experiences of death and what lies behind them. Joel Schumacher directs with some skill - creating some very scary scenes as well as the most beautiful ones. Death Visions are not what viewers can expect, nor what awaits us when we go - thanks to screenwriter Petru Filardi, who really did a great job with this story. While the story's creativity is impressive, the story also has many holes, especially in logical separation and credibility factors. Despite the fact that Flatliners is a good script thanks to a scenario, a direction that is sometimes very unreal, and acting that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors works and reacts very nicely. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as a group leader - the one who comes up with the idea of ​​dying and reborn. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a devastating, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is fine as the most practical and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as a voice of reason and human concern. Platt has really good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is also very good here. actors do their best to play each other and make us believe that they are such good friends. I was excited about the many Flatliners, but more than anything else, the story influenced me the most. The scene with the dog running down the street is just one of those powerful images that evoked many flashback scenes.
