Every scene is so perfectly presented. I've never seen a movie that has meaning in almost every scene before. Well, when I watched this movie, I remember watching "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are based on the same plot line. But both are perfectly perfect and have the opportunity to create their own world. Red is capable of evoking a lot of people's fate and storytelling ideas. And I'm still thinking about it. The story is great and the end is a little funny. I laughed at the end of the scene. Well funny, as these three Red White and Blue films are combined. <br /> <br /> All in all a great work of art. Master work. <br /> <br /> 10/10
