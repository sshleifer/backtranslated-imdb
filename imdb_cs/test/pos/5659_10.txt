Although it was a failure in the cinemas because mainly Mylene Farmer, one of the top 3 stars in France had no first role. Fans changed their minds and waited for the DVD. When it was released this year on DVD, it is a huge success! Others failed at a slow pace and incredible length (3h) at the time (1994), which criticized the critics. But the melancholic story is compulsory that slow pace and long time. The morale of the film is that you cannot escape from the death you are destined to. It is the same theme as in the film "The End Target" and makes it a Gothic story. The atmosphere is very melancholic.
