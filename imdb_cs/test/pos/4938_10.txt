This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girlfriend or family. Basically one of those who feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones. This movie is light, but makes you think and will make you laugh. Just a really simple but versatile plot. He would think that most people might be involved in this film in some way. The characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job of sucking you into the movie. And the film ends with a hilarious Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time and now I want to own it. :)
