'Radio' is a beautiful film based on the true story of mentally disabled James Robert Kennedy, nicknamed 'Radio', and a football coach from T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. Cuba Gooding, Jr. I'd never imagine him in a serious performance, especially since most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so it's not new. A mentally challenged young man named James Robert Kennedy, always around T.L. Hanna High School without being bothered and almost noticed. One day, when a soccer ball approaches him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of Johnny Cas, one of the best football team players, and one of the most unpleasant guys you've ever met. One day Cash decides to punish James, taunt him with other football players and even go so far as to get stuck. When Coach Jones discovers that a terrible act, he will remain angry and punish the entire team, deciding on that day to help James, who gets the nickname 'Radio' because of his passion for radio in general. The film shows how the radio becomes a knowledgeable assistant, helping the team to train despite the challenges of the players, and even the respect of all the people who live in a small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. He has a life lesson that shows us how one can change something, even if it is not what we call "normal". Radio has a big heart and is unable to hate anyone, and that is the thing we should all apply to our daily lives.
