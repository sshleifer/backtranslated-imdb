A vampire prince falls on a human girl, unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter. This is the basic theme of this romp martial art, which borrows ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" but manages to maintain its own style. I was confused by the British and Hong Kong title "The Twins Effect" because there are no twins in the story. It turns out that the two main female characters play Hong Kong pop stars, acting as "Twins". Don't let it discourage you. These girls can act (at least well enough for this type of movie) and add a lot of magic to it. Jackie Chan appears on a few portraits of portrait by adding a dash to his own brand of grotesque chaos to drive. All this is great fun for those who like their vampires, who have helped us with humor on the tongue.
