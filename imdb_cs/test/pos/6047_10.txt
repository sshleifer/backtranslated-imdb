The illustration of Jack Webb's Marine Drill Instructor does not make any interpretation. Directly forward, right in front, all this applies to this classic. At a time when the analysis of our leaders' claims is a necessity to understand what they are saying, this film does not play any games with our language or our moral thread. The right and the wrong are clear and easy to define. If you like a clear, well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should suit you.
