I feel very strongly that this film was just like Waiting for Exhale with white women in the fifties. As in Waiting for Exhale, all female characters mixed with men who were either married or not good. The only difference, except the obvious, was that there wasn't much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed kind and sincere (Hope Lange guy), but there was a conflict in this relationship as well. he had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately, for them romance didn't look even though it was young, intelligent and attractive. This film could be called the tearjerker with the saddest part involving the character Suzy Parker, whose ex-boyfriend obsession leads to tragedy.
