Judith Ivey as an old whore is amazing. Emily Grace young girl. She's innocent and exciting when she learns what's going down. Great direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. It shows what is happening and can happen with misfortune. Big independent movie. Small cast. The tempo is initially slow and then moves well. A good movie to show your teen age daughter who has ambitions to leave home early on the open road and adventure. This movie, the film has a low budget for it, but it works because of the low lives and areas in which these people move.
