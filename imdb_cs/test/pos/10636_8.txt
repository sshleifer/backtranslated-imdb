Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms it. As if it wasn't enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of her greatest or other generation's actresses. So, as you may well imagine, those pieces of casting are worth the fact that we are terrible. Isabelle and Annie play characters on the screen we've never seen before. Mother and daughter, yes, but with such reckless boldness that I sometimes couldn't even blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the director's intentions, I do not believe that they (the intentions that are) go beyond the shocking anecdote, and the end has forced me to scream with frustration, but I was riveted by a story written face to face. the sensational Huppert and the fury of Girardot's power. I highly recommend cinema lovers anywhere and great performers like me can't miss "La Pianiste"
