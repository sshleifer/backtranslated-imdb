When a group of escaped convicts manage to escape to a remote island, they soon discover that their new home is occupied by a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of the fame of "Zombi 2"), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and a horde superstitious natives. The natives say the doctor created a grotesque half-man, half-fishing animals for bad, secret purposes. For one, they start changing their thoughts. "Screamers" is a very fun mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from Deep". There is a lot of gore with a really cool decapitation scene and throat tearing to boost. The acting is so-so, but the movie is fast-paced and fun.
