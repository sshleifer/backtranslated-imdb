I was impressed by this film because of the quality of acting and the strong message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a noble, irrational and wealthy mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that she has to stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana watching an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is doubtful, but at first she has no choice - the bond with her mother is pathologically strong. At a time when a girl sees that a mother is in fantasy flight and does not have it. feet on the ground. She sees her mother walking on the heels of a handsome, seductive guy who loves and leaves them. She sees that the mother won't get it. So how can one look at her mother for guidance? The mother directs the girl to a rehearsal drama and sees her daughter behaving in part of her mother in such a way that the shocking painful mirror is raised to her mother's fly. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified by the impact on her mother and is apologetic, but the lesson is held. There is character-growth as your mother realizes her selfish claim about her daughter and ultimately convinces her to let the girl go. It is a moving scene and a valuable lesson that parents, whether they are emotionally dependent, must let the child go and become their own independent person.
