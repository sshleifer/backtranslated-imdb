Morris and Reva Applebaum were in the heyday of Broadway. At the age of ninety, Morris is a widower. He summons his sons - a psychotherapist and a BMW car dealer - and his daughter, a TV writer / producer, to attend a party in his honor, after which he euthanizes himself. Literally minded creatures that are, take what they say at face value. He leads them, his grandchildren and some others, including an African-Jewish-psychiatrist reminiscent of Godfrey Cambridge, about the merry chase in Manhattan when he tries to stop him or discourage him. <br /> <br /> Comedy works completely. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This film deserves more than deserves an audience: it deserves popular success.
