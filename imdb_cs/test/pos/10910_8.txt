Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at high school in the small town of Indiana. He finally married Emily (Joan Cusack), which is a great pleasure for his parents. The city is also busy because one of his own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) was nominated for an Academy Award-winning Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, watch the Academy Awards on TV because Cameron is the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he has been able to fulfill his role as a homosexual military man, partly because of the lessons he has learned from a gay teacher in high school. You guessed, his Howard! But Howard never "went out"; in fact, he believes he is equal! With the whole city and the media members waiting and watching the events, Howard and Emily come out and marry? Or is Howard really gay and realizing he can't go through the ceremony? It's a wonderful, fun and humane movie about a homosexual and his situation. As a man-who-not-realized-on-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is equally gentle, with Cusack's stitch as a mixed fianc√© and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and others on hand to please the audience as well. The costumes are very nice and the environment in the beautiful heart of Indiana is beautiful. Then also, the script, direction and production are very, very nice. But this insightful, witty and thoughtful look at the homosexual population is undoubtedly the best benefit of the film. For those who would be offended by a gay-themed movie, yes, just skip to this. For anyone who wants to laugh warmly and get a better understanding of the gay situation, it's definitely the best movie out there.
