It's not a story. It's a lot of psychic needles that touch your subconscious. If you wait for the story, you'll be bored. But if you do, you'll be in his Dreamworld within 10 minutes. Unclear but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own imagination. A strange soundtrack that gives you a sense of isolation, visual echoes of Christ's crucifixion, pulsating light, and deep dark shadows will all reach your subconscious to fill this space of mind. I found myself shaking and unable to escape from the television. It was like dreaming with open eyes. A strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... touched me deep inside and called me alive. He freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of losing personality and merging into the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. However, violent freedom .... It is not a nice movie, but very strong and memorable. Literally my text doesn't have spoilers. The big surprise of this movie was the incredible intensity that can be described as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie, the better you watch it.
