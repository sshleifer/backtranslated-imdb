Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. Mrs. Andrews' opening song, "Whistling Away from the Dark", will always be on the back of my mind. The plot line during World War I is great and exciting. If you're romantic, you'll love this movie. This is a movie that I have always liked to see again and again.
