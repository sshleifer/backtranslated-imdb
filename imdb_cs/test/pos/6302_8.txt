The opening film Consequences of Love sets this interesting and immersive film perfectly. The traveler slowly carries a lone figure out of focus toward the camera behind which is a huge suitcase. Like the central character in the film, we know nothing about him and our initial interpretation, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be off the mark. The consequences of love are such a kind of film. From the title you can expect Bergmanesq's dissection of the relationship. Instead, we have a leading character, Titt, living a life in an emotional exile who has apparently decided to cut off those who are around him. If a film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery because we are dealing with who Titt is and what he is. What we know is that it's 50'ish, cool, folded and precious. He has lived in a luxury Swiss hotel for the last eight years and has always paid his room time on time, but has rarely been interested in employees or other guests. His only real companions are spouses who play casual card games. The couple, it manifests itself, owned the hotel, but now gambling everything off and having just the room in which they live left. Their love for money, antiques, and each other was their grudge, and Titta seems to identify with their hardship. He once had it all but now he lives as a virtual prisoner in a hotel. His brother, a long-haired surfing instructor, sometimes looks at him, but sees his visits as a disruption rather than a pleasure. He talks about a person Titta considers his best friend, though he hasn't seen him for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a telephone technician, correcting the communications network that brings so much together. Meanwhile, Tittas and his wife and children are calling quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, Titta is atypical and begins to open up to a young bartender from the hotel. With his emotion-obscured judgment, he sets out to take action that ultimately seals his fate for good. The slow development of Tittas's fall from grace is beautifully written, filmed, and scored. The Thunder Techno soundtrack does a lot to build a tension, as more and more secrets appear, the last half hour turns into a learned thriller, as Titta lets her mask slip and has to face the consequences of her actions again. The end, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic, yet ambiguous, leaving the audience once again to challenge his motives. Patrick Bliss, June 1, 2006
