This is early from the boys, but some people may not be as happy with it as everyone else. I found it different from your average Stooge grotesque. It was more fun for jokes than for foolish eyes or for slapping. Watch out for the cheerful part when Larry grabs a Moe stethoscope and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part forced me to a good ten minutes. Another hit for Stooges.
