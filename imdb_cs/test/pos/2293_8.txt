You had to live in Japan for a while and enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for more than 2 years and in Honshu in the north of 4. Believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate picture of the east / west contrast, both sports and personal relationships. A humorous, witty, and pleasing film that deserves better than Americans to judge. 8+ out of 10!
