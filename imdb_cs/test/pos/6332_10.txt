I was looking at Buffy The Vampire Slayer and didn't really start to love the show until Season 4 started. The writers of this episode did a great job that scared me. I was in awe of the episode I just finished 2 minutes ago. Amazing does not touch the surface of what this episode achieves almost without dialogue. If you've never given this show many thought at least watch this episode. If it doesn't impress, then probably no episode. <br /> <br /> BTW My heart is still racing ...
