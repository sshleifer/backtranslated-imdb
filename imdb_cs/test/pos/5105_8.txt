He caught the 1969 film on TCM cable one night. I remember when I first saw a movie in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petul Clark. I love Clark best in "Finian's Rainbow" by Francis Ford Coppola (1968) opposite Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Just ecstatic to learn that finally, this wonderful Irish pot of gold musical is released on DVD! "It's the old devil's moon (in the eyes)." Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - quite free. He doesn't have to be a veteran in a musical like Rex Harrison, but he has admirably lived this role. The scene of his running through the lawn in his cape and flying-reminds me of the PBS series, "Serve them all my days" - a kind teacher and a loving man, he's, "sir" Chipey. Clark and O'Toole somehow gave us the right combination of spun and circumstances. Leslie Bricuss' songs and lyrics are catchy as usual. Those melodies "You and Me" and "Walk Through the World (with Me)" stayed with me most of all those years. And there's "What a lot of flowers," "And the sky smiled," "Fill the world with love" - ​​not syrups at all. Sometimes I think that if the world plunged into the songs and the words of Bricuss, we would overcome all the disputes on Earth and "beautiful" all our days! Yes, "Talk to animals," too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) The musicals are a blessing to the audience world, they are somehow bigger than life. Just like the music and lyrics of Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.), who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who wouldn't feel completely pleased, simply pronounced "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" "?" I was even shocked by just one of the presented songs and a dance number in the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). My favorite favorite is "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) by French director Jacques Demy (1967) with a colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and (late sister) Francoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, singing Dance Music by Michel Legrand. Long live musicals.
