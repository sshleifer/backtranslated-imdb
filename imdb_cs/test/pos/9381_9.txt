George Barry's "Death Bed: A Bed That Eat" is at the root, a dark fairy tale told through a horror-film framework. In my opinion, it is one of the best films of the 1970s, and it's totally punishable that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to bed, ASAP). If you're looking for an obvious gore or rabid action, "Death Bed: The Bed To Eats" isn't a swing for you. "Dead bed" is a softer, stranger drive-in image; it plays as a totally strange dream, half remembered. I would recommend reading Stephen Thrower's summary of "Death Bed" in Thrower's book FAB Press, "Nightmare USA" (perfectly describes the vibration of the film). Whether intentional or not, I noticed "Death Bed" in everything, from "Phantasm" to "Cemetery Man" by Michele Soavi, to magical realism / fictional authors' fiction like Kelly Link. Barry is original and in a fair world I'm sure he would follow "Death Bed" with a number of fantastic bizarre movies.
