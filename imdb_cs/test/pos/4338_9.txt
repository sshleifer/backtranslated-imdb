This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some bugs but I still enjoyed it. This time Charles is not just one or two muggers, but an army. Death Wish 3 has a lot of great action scenes and I enjoyed it every second. Director Michael Winner knows how to manage a good action movie like this, and Jimmy Page provides music where Golan and Globus producers are still doing something and Charles Bronson still works for Paul Kersey. This movie also made it seem that Michael was trying to end the Death Wish series and I can't blame him and I love the weapon that Charles uses. Death Wish 3 is one of the biggest movies of 1985 and can't be better than this. I give this 9/10
