A year after her triumphant first special, "My Name Is Barbra," Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to create this follow-up CBS-TV specialty in the then revolutionary color. The first broadcast in March 1966, "Color Me Barbra" follows a similar format as its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they dress like period maid, walk around galleries and become part of the song through song. In various forms, Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the schtick comedy "Minut Waltz" to the melodrama "Non C'est Rien" in Modigliani's painting to beatnik-style madness "Gotta Move" set to abstract art. My favorite moment in the special is when she turns into the dead ring of Queen Nefertiti, while singing the terrible rendition of Rogers and Hart's "Where or When". Opening with another comic monologue full of stupid vice Sequiturs, this time in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a colorful circus medley where it communicates with animals, including her beloved Sadie. She finds the appropriate context for "Sam, You Did Pants Too Long" with the Penguin Goose and comically compares her profile to the anteater with "We Have So Much in Common". As with the first special, the program ends with a thrilling solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts, "Any place I hang my hat", "Where am I?" and "Starting Here, Starting Now" between them. Also included is a brief idea she made in 1986, ironically dressed in a full-color version when she was first released on VHS. The juxtaposition of the locale and the song is even more effective than in its first specialty, and the 23-year-old Streisand is at peak.
