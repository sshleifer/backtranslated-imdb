This film gives 9 out of 10 just because there is not enough specific scientific reference to the amount of energy needed to produce food to satisfy science scientists. Mdixon seems to believe that these commented commentators are doing it, but even an elementary understanding of the sources and laws of thermodynamics will prove to be at least on a solid scientific basis, claiming that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must switch to different kinds of energy a plan to replace the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations refused to face the facts of life and perished. Read Jared Diamond's "Collapse", a popular book, or any basic textbook on Ecology or Earth Science, and you can verify the basic assumption of this film. Go for it when Rome is burned!
