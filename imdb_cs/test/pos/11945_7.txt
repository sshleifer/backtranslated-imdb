This movie is similar to "Better Off Dead" because it has some of the same stars. But this one isn't that good. It is admitted that it is rather funny and fun, there is something about "Better ... that I like, good. This one has these boys who go to Nantucket to spend their summer holidays there. that is trying to save the house This guy who wants to make him a lobster restaurant doesn't seem to like lobsters, because in one scene he keeps him in the boiling water and puts a stethoscope to hear him screaming torn between this girl and the girl The son of a guy who wants to make a restaurant, or somehow it leads to a big big boat show, just like "Summer Rental", though it works a bit better and fits in though what's with the boat races at this time? There was some strange fascination with them? For the most part, this movie brings laughter to a good clip, but "better of the dead" was even better to cause it was first and jokes worked better.
