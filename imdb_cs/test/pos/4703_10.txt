At the Sundance Film Festival, I went to a screening of "SISTER HELEN" and I didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> People in this document asked me. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The creators captured the essence of the amazing soul of Sister Helena and took me to an unknown world. On the way I was completely satisfied and I was completely taken aback by this film. The film speaks to those who yearn for a second chance in life.
