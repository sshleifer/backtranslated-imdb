This is undoubtedly one of my favorite horror movies ever! I really can't believe it didn't get much more popularity when it was released, particularly when the main rivals at the time were customary Wes Craven's sequels and copycat horrors, Mute Witness has all the styles, suspense and quickfire reversal plot Hitchcock / DePalma, coupled a very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be nothing more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie, but it's hard to enjoy the movie just for what it is. Territorial Conspiracy on Billie Hughes - A Mute Girl Works on a Horror Movie Set at a Russian Factory. A series of events, she finds herself accidentally closed, and stumbles upon the filming of a snuff. One of the best things about the film is the lack of screams that seem to attack every horror-filmed movie. Because the main character is dumb, he can't make noise - something that is a blessing in some stages of the film, and a curse in others. It seems that the director studied his Hitchcock very well, Even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcock's "Psycho" as well as the relatively general movie scene slasher. While acting can be hammy at times, the entire movie keeps it together, not only throwing in some excellent scenes that will take you right to the edge of your seat, but a few neat little questions about how the movie will end . All in all, and the overwhelmingly overlooked, well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller that I would recommend for any tired viewer looking for something a little different than the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien regurgitation is on hallowe'en.
