When I entered the theater, I thought it would be a great movie. And I wasn't a little disappointed. WOW! This movie is great! Feelings of the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting of Madhavan and Simrano. Krásná hudba A.R. Rahmane. This could probably be the best Tamil movie I saw in age. Mani Ratnam has once again proved to be the best in meaningful and cordial films. This film is essentially about a young girl (PS Keerthana) looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who left her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (JD Chakravathy) . A young writer (Madhavan) learns about the story of a young girl and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this little child, but one day they find out that they are not her real parents and decide to look for her biological mother. This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam introduced the film is amazing. <br /> <br /> My Rating - 10/10
