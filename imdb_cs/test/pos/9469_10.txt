I thought this movie was absolutely cheerful. I already knew it would be a fun movie, but it was more fun than I expected. Certainly there were some lame jokes, but they cracked me. I thought the actors would turn out to be pretty bad, but the actors were that they did that well. I have to give Amanda Bynes a kudos, she looked surprisingly like her brother, and as a boy she got an amazing performance. As for the other actors, they were also entertaining. Of course there were times when you would scream on the screen "how not to say it?" But that's just part of the fun. It turned out pretty well in the end. There's a happy ending, but what did you expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, just cheerful.
