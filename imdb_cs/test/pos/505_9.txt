In the ever-growing film genre of adaptation of comic book books, Blade is by far one of the best-realized and most faithful (overall) source materials .... since the character has nearly 30 years of history in his comic since his character has been around since its inception. Debut as a back up character in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL characters and conspiracy elements from comic history. While the changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film return directly to any criticism. Don't let any of you tell you anything else: Blade is one fine film. If it's too "comic" for you, Stanley Kubrick is snobbing for you, it's because he has it. Deal with it, but don't let it go.
