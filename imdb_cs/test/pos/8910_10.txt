MONKEY is certainly one of the best shows ever shown on television. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and turned on the TV to watch MONKEY. I loved it. It had a kickass action scene, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic song theme that was never guaranteed to leave your head and hilarious dubbing. But it is strange that it takes place in China and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but there is no way to make this TV show loving. MONKEY is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (ShirÃ´ Kishibe) and, of course, an unforgettable and enjoyable character, the Monkey (Masaaki Sakai), who travels from China to India to get a lot of saints scrolls to save the world. > <br /> MONKEY is great fun and magic.
