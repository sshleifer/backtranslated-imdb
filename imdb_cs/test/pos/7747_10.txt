I thought this movie was fun. I've never seen old movies before, and this was a really great first movie. It had warmth and heart and spirit. It was a kind of cheese, but in today's film industry, it is cheesy cute. I gave it ten and I highly recommend renting, buying or seeing the movie anyway you can. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic, and you knew the character thought he'd have it all. The female leadership was perfect because their two personalities had a spark and wanted to stick to see what would happen. The grandmother in the movie was invaluable. The perfect addition to the big old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't wish him. See.
