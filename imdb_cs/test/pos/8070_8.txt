The summary line is some wet dream of men for the ideal woman ... o) Really, back to the movie, which has a classic film written all over it (pun intended and literally shown in the picture, as well as you see)! How could someone make a silent film this year and age? It's not completely silent for once (maybe music). There is an answer with great cinema. And no wonder he won prizes in this area (as another user said)! Sometimes it is also a fall. Even though the pictures are great, sometimes too much is immersed in them instead of moving forward (plot and time). If you deal with it, you'll enjoy it more than I do. I didn't tell you anything about the story, but I'll never do it because I don't want to spoil you ...
