This may be the movie I've ever seen most tense. In fact, it's so nervous that I couldn't watch him after two years, but I couldn't watch him. since I have a DVD. There have been a few scenes that are almost too much to watch .... so if you have problems and need to "escape" for an hour-and-half of this movie, your mind will be nothing else. Russian actress Marina Zudina did a great job in her facial expressions, which she had to do, because her character here is muted. She plays a cute and healthy makeup artist for lean filmmakers. After the shooting and "Billie" is about to leave, he hears something. She looks into the room where she shoots and finds out that they're shooting a 'snuff film' and actually killing someone. Billie's wiretapping is discovered and running for her life when the murderers in this large warehouse are looking for her. There are two widespread scenes in which our heroine runs for her life and both will wear you. First I described above. The second scene, high, goes too long and is not as good first. In fact, the film should be cropped a bit, but overall, because it's so good to keep our attention, then it served its purpose as entertainment.
