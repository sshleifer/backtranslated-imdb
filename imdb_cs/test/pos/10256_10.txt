Cooley High is such a great movie that even with the soundtrack, urban landscape, wardrobe and slang it still doesn't feel old. By the way, the soundtrack is a timeless classic in itself. Instead, it absorbs you directly into it. This is the core of good film. You won't miss a rhythm from start to finish and never tired of watching him. The end is unique in the sense that it is one of the saddest and uplifting all ending films. Ever since Backdraft thought, but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
