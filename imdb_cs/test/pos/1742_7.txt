I really started enjoying this show. It just started slowly and didn't get the chance he deserved. It's summer so many people don't watch TV at home. I know there are several talent and singing competitions, but I like it just like many others. believe it or not when an American idol is done in a year that I miss. Though it was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for singers at the show, who are really starting to grow into me. I wish they would rethink and give the show back. I think it was a quick move to cancel. My only complaint about the show is that I didn't care about the power of the referees.
