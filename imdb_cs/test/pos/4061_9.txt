Dad (78) and I (46) both had a good time watching today's movie. For a guy primarily known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it helps to prevent his previous films from being played against. Consider one of these roles, 15 minutes, was the police that had to deal with media interference, and you have an interesting set of benchmarking / contrasting performances. Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley character. Shatner plays himself, a parallel world that was best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK. It is interesting to watch the film comment on the contrast between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts on television and film. Shatner lectures on suitable means of gliding over the hood of a car; De Niro points to cases that scratch the hood surface. Ironically, as the film progresses, the character of De Niro begins to incorporate the illusions of reality TV-cop into a real world case that works. The film draws inspiration from a variety of sources, so one can make a commentary about derivation. So what? Satira must derive its humor so that it can exist. In addition, the film has unpredictable moments of originality. For example, I'm pretty sure the method of criminal death has never been done before. One Quarrel About the Reality of Used Weapons - Shouldn't These Weapons Have Any Kickback? To penetrate the steel, these charges had to have sufficient inertia to penetrate. And the highest bullet inertia is at the moment of fire. So .... shooting the salons of these bullets should put the shooter back on their butts. What the hell ... it's satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil is in itself a satire on B-F-Guns, which is so carelessly used in thrillers. <br /> <br />
