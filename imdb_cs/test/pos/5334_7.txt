The first feature film by Aardman Wallace and Gromit can bring the elements of all the previous half-hour shows on TV. Wallace runs a company that humanly captures dishonest rabbits from humans. Vegetable Gardens, and has a clear idea to test your invention on unhappy bunnies as soon as they are caught. Of course, as in other Wallace and Gromit films, things don't work as planned. Similar to closed shaving, there is a love interest in Wallace, in this case Lady Posh, and a big average rogue with a bull dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions that make the character laugh. And of course Peter Sallis gives Wallace the voice again and is perfectly fit. And like on the day of the day, the cheese has a great comic effect when the film moves along. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, this movie is a bit long. There are great effects, and some pieces that will put you down and watch, but perhaps this story would work better as another short subject, rather than pushing on the feature-length.
