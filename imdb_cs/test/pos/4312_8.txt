It's good to watch if u have time - dealing with three friends who get into a useless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves in battle with some dark people and cannot deal with them. a very, very disturbing depiction of Japan, the wickedness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but a little potboiler <br /> spoiler was that the plot is not very clear based on English subtitles. Of course, I don't know Japanese. the only other Japanese movies I've seen were kurosawa, which is different and much more noble than this modern genre. So, I really can't compare. otherwise it will be better compared to most Hollywood "blockbusters" for story and creation. <br /> <br /> taptieg24
