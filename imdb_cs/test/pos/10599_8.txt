I saw this movie hoping for a good laugh, but when I watched that I didn't stop laughing for weeks, they were such bad actors and it made this movie so much more enjoyable to watch. (BTW Ryan Dunn did not eat a toy car, put it in his ass) Random performance of skaters and parts of Vitos was great. Give me the Vito grapes. No Valo, your grapes are in the shop. I would not recommend any younger than 13 to look at it, frankly, they would not understand half of the jokes or what they are talking about. I like VLB and after watching this movie I couldn't help but go buy or Viva La Bam series. What is the deal with this stupid thing? Must be 10 lines, what's the Bull-sh1t? I should be able to write one so long or in this case as short as I want. I'm just going to write until he tells me I can actually send it. It's just a waste of time, I expected to say what I wanted, it wasn't much, but then I said I had to give more and then it corrects my spelling, so what if I didn't buy something right, you get what I think. That's ridiculously long. Those who live by the sword are shot by those who are not
