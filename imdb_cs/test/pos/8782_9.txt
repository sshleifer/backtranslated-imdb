Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until it gets lost after BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR confirm it. When I admired most of the director's work for many years, I managed to skip it, perhaps because of lack of interest in Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings as leading actors. Of course, I was acquainted with the summit of the Statue of Liberty that I had seen it repeatedly in film retrospectives, but I was wrong to assume that the story that would lead to it might not be of interest. I was wrong! The thrilling plot gets cooking right from the bat by accidentally engaging between Bad Guy Saboteur and Good Guy Wrongly Accused protagonist and continues to approach a series of other casual encounters and narrow leaks. Known Hitchcock elements are all: an innocent man who has been accused of crime; people are not what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely places that intensify the thrilling scene that takes place in them (aircraft hangar, ranch, bridge from which the bound hero throws himself to escape the police, the sumptuous charity ball in the palace, the skyscraper on the top floor and the Sculpture Torch) freedom). All the time, humor is provided by supportive players, generous dollops from the beginning of World War II - social commentary, moments of human heat where suffering people find it in themselves. lend a hand to help people in return? in short, there was always a basic humanity at the core of Hitchcock, however grisly trappings - stunning cast supporting players, mainly Otto Kruger as the most beautiful villain this George Sanders side (his Broadway credits include male lead in Noel Coward's. PRIVATE LIVES ?? and it says that all) and lasik Norman Lloyd as a titular saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger? no relationship to Otto? as a prominent widow company involved in the fifth column intrigue (her character marks Claude Rains' mother in NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a great job with a difficult role. For most of her early scenes, we can't tell whether she believes the hero is innocent or guilty, and she seems to be constantly shifting her mind until the end of the trial. It can't be determined whether her actions are to blame or whether we should be kept in a state of uncertainty, but the development of the plot is so fast, fun and clever that we don't really care what he thinks. Then there are special Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. Double Lane Character Suspends to Get Change for Quarter? one day to give her kidnappers ice cream and call from the phone booth again. Why these scenes have been inserted are anyone guessing maybe to make the movie seem more realistic and thus increase credibility and tension? Or maybe the audience could catch a breath for a while? Some of the characters are on top ?? a courageous truck driver, an incredibly kind and trustworthy blind man living alone in a spotlessly maintained forest hut, a political-philosophical "human skeleton" and other members of a circus caravan hiding the protagonists from their pursuers.
