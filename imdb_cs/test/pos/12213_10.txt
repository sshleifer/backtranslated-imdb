I like the Surface show very much. The show is very fun and it's a pure show. Interesting is the surface like Show. He keeps my attention. He has compassion and tension. I love all the members who are at the show. They are very good choices. I think it's very important to have a good cast of Any Show because that's what makes a show a success and of course scenes and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in good ways and wrong. I like to watch some comedy, action, tension and romance. A scifi. But the surface is a show I hope will come back for many seasons because it's a great show and something families can watch. My kids are grown, but my husband and I are looking at these types of shows. I appreciate your time and let me express my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thanks. Paulette Blackwell
