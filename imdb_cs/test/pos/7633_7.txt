"L'Ossessa" (released in English under many titles and the most interesting of which is certainly "The desert midnight horror show") is one of the best Italian rip-offs "The Exorcist". To really appreciate this movie, you should have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is also slim (but naive), pathetic and sometimes moving. Danila (Stella Carnacina), an art student, goes to the old church to see the statue she is. recovery. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already overcome by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps planning dark acts. The face shows endless suffering. The statue dates from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the mastery of the sculptor - the sculpture looks almost alive! He lives with his parents. Her mother, Luisa (Lucretia Love), lives a corrupt life and doesn't care too much about maintaining her appearance. Her father Mario (Chris Avram) watches with disillusioned eyes. The wooden sculpture soon attracts human form (Ivan Rassimov) and owns Danila in a physical and spiritual sense. Amazing scene! Poor Danila will now be suffering from the torture of hell. Danila (beautiful Stella Carnacina) was destroyed, violated, obsessed with the devil, and now follows his orders, trying to seduce. other. Isn't she mimicking her sleazy mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her a bunch of roses? There's a scene so ridiculous as to be noble and moving when Stella Carnacina runs in desperation through the narrow streets (obsessed with the devil, remember?) A small Italian town that screamed her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is, as usual, intense. Exorcist scenes (especially the final battle) are very, very amateur, but it only increases fun (and / or emotions?), If you really have a sense of humor. Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and this is a factor that contributes to your pleasure when she is naked, but I think the movie could explore more of her natural beauty. Lucretia Love is a very good sleaze companion (her naked rose scene ... well. :) <br /> <br /> Another Italian exorcist rip-off I would like to recommend for you are: Malabimba (very slim and relaxed uncut and digitally restored) "Evil Eye" (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films such as "Rosemary's Baby" should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" is upstairs. Not so slim, but a lot of beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll drool all over the movie. The film is ridiculous, the story makes no sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you can feel moving! - Devil sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. Wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you like "Evil Eye", see "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market. Find this title in IMDb. Good reviews about that. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "L'Ossessa" has many different faces. It is exploitative, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, cheesy ... sleazy (but not so much) and has a basic "moral" message. This strange beer can sometimes be very funny. We all know that "L'Ossessa" is an "exorcist" rip-off, so why don't we see him under his own conditions? Yes, Mario Gariazzo tried to make money fast, but he managed to get the most out of the line budget. The story is well-said, the film is atmospheric and the actors are generally involved in their roles. Watch an open mind movie and discover two or three new things.
