Wow! I chose it from a rental shelf because I love Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting.' This is a phenomenal film; He has action, romance, tension, intrigue and joke. When I wasn't allowed, I was at the edge of my seat. This is definitely a movie I would recommend to people with recognition for intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything I enjoy!
