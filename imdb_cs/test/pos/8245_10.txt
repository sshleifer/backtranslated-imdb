In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the reality of war and tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and blew into Gallipoli's land. The lack of violence in no way prevented the size of the story in hand. It is honest, true and brave, as well as men who fought and died in Hellespont. The lack of brutal depiction of violence is just and right. Those men suffered enough freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never want this scene to meet again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. Suffering from a scene of gratuitous pyrotechnics and blood and gore is best suited to maintaining proper respect for the warriors of this cup of nationality. This film fame in the majesty of the men fighting for their lives, with honor, courage, dignity and irreparable spirit and humor in the face of terrible adversity. This film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to cheer up. The brutal results found in these men's personal struggles are not the thing that survivors would like to see on the screen for fun. They'd seen enough of that at the time, and they'd rather never have seen it and never wanted to see such scenes on screen again in the name of "entertainment." The brutal horrors of actual fighting in Gallipoli were scenes that haunted their awakening and hours of sleep for the rest of their natural days. They were the painful inner scars they, the men of all the nations who fought, carried inside the graves. They all fought, and many died in the face of all this, and so powerful men could laugh in the teeth of a constant terrible death, because they wouldn't hurt their friends by not being ready to die next to them. It is the Australasian for the Brave, the game is, but it applied to all fighters in a greater or lesser degree, but the word from the boy that fought was that Johhny Turk was like a game, it is as brave as you would ever wish a soldier to be. ANZAC and the Turks fought to create their place on the world stage, and from 25/04/15 their respective demands for equality in nationality in this world have become known and undeniable. The director has created a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of these soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages, for children to be taken without fear of fright for the sake of visual "horror" and it is a morbid and pointless appeal. And children should participate in this film to learn what happened on this sacred bank before they were born. To remember it. For it is the nature of the people that they will soon forget.
