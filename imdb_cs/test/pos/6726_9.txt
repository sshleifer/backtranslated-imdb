It's good to see that I'm not the only one to remember this great movie. I very much like the memories of this film - I seem to remember uncertainly when I was about 8 years old and watching TV shows of children after school. That was the first and last movie that scared me - and the boy's pictures surrounded by the mist on the hill remain with me forever! Like most films of this era, it has a happy ending - focused on children, but with some ability to capture the attention of adults. The beautiful Cornwall scenery really sets the movie to feel isolated - and the "scary" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I'd like to try again to find this movie - see if it hits the home yet!
