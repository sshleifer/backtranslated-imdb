If you've ever seen Open Water, it's the same kind of daring, nervous, indie style movie. I liked the action, the tension. slow building everything, just hope it won't do what they did Open Water, with that sequel .. but anyway, one thing I didn't like was the annoying younger sister, I was rooting for croc all the time .. movie He starts quite as if he should, "pack kids on a trip, hire a guide who has mysteriously left 5 minutes. Before they got there, I think his assistant will take two sisters, and a friend on the water, now thinks it's the second day of their adventure, curiously enough the first day they spent at the quarrel, hmm crocodile farm. so they are out there and everything is good for a while, then bang, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie you don't see crocodile, all the hell out of a lot, but when you do it, gosh is very scary ,, I love crocodile muzzle and eyes, and the mantle of fog, which seems to cover croc every time he raises his head over the water, very very creepy, but good, overall it's a great movie, if you can get around annoying sisters.
