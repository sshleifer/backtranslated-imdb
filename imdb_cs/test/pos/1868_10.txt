This sitcom was a large crowd of extractors in 1984-1985. This was the time when people could see deserted streets in most crowded Indian cities whenever there were sitcoms on Indian TV screens. All of this was the result of the establishment of television relays across the Indian nation. This was one of the basic elements of the modernization of the Indian television network strategy adopted by late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided pure entertainment that the vast majority of Indian TV viewers watched on their black and white television sets. The funny thing about this series is that it has been sponsored by a domestic company dealing with iurvedic products. A few days ago I looked at some episodes of this series, but the overall laughing equation was missing. This proves that with the ever-changing time entertainment material can lose its charm and hold on to people's minds.
