Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP the first true L&H movie. THE SECOND VOICE YEAR was the first "official" L&H movie, but this was the one Stan had given up on not only performing (he had signed up with Hal Roach Studios as director and "gag-man" for certain situations - among them Oliver Hardy's accident with the leg of a lamb leg leading to Stanovi, who had to replace him, and the extra money he and his new wife Lois would give him, brought his historical return to execution, as well as writing, directing, editing and engaging in other areas of production), but He also realized that he was part of a team that worked well. This is a historical and very important film in the history of comedy. It's also a surprisingly funny little silent movie; rather different from that of Laurel and Hardy would become known and from what they are more immediately connected with today. Characters' Stan & Ollie Don't Appear - Scottish Stan Laurel plays nephew of Oliver Hardy, a decent man about the city who is reluctant to be seen with this strange boy with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. There are some very funny moments in this well-made, charming little movie, and the performances of these two comedy kings are spot-on - watching Stan's little 'knife-kick' and smile that says, "Well waddaya know?" when they see girls, or for example at the airport shrunken scene. Pleasantly. Watch this movie, if you can, with the backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on VVL video), which feels like 20 years old and very, very pleasant to listen to. It's a great and underrated little movie, so I said it's surprisingly funny.
