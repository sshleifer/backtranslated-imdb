I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've ever watched (forget the stupid Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is amazing melancholic. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" on the sea side (but three years earlier), two women fighting for a man where mad love could lead one. The female character (anti) heroine, Anne Providence, is excellent, acting without compromise as a child, lost alone in finding her own female identity in the real world. He's a pretty weird movie hero, not a humorous pirate, like most of her companions in the genre, doesn't make jokes all the time, fights for the poor and good, and just kills silly Spanish or British soldiers or - better - governors, but murdered all poor prisoners of war , after catching the ship (beware of it at the beginning of the movie), is primitive (can not even read), is desperate and she gets an alcoholic, loses all her friends as a result of her stubbornness and wears most of the film rags. This movie shows a pirate "hero" a bit (!) A little like him (or in this case "she" but there was a woman "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) could be in brutal reality. The film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking way. The 1950s movie certainly has no exciting special effects for the contemporary audience (the boats float very clearly in the tub), but this real drama about love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drives one mad. Perhaps Anne is even allegedly Judas Iskarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in one person who was betrayed by her friend (French LaRochelle) as Jesus; after his friend was disappointed, he handed him the death penalty (like Judas); than getting remorse (like Judas, who commits suicide by the gospel of Matthew); and eventually sacrifice himself for saving a beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you are not interested in these philosophical questions of guilt and atonement, the film brings a lot of (cheap) actions such as sword fighting and (plastic) boat burning to a very short hour and a half.
