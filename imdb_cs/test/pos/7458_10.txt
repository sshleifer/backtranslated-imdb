I've always used animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Though none of them are as upset as Duckman. Originally aired between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted for a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have gone forever without ever becoming. The titular character is discombobulated, an unapologetic lance and largely the worst living person in the world. He is a private detective, widower, peeping toma, alcoholic, sexual maniac, murderer, and (fill in blank). You name it, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being such a slimeball when the world we live in is so crazy, outrageous and simply plain nonsense? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by manic Jason Alexander) could carry the show alone, but when surrounded by a lot of eccentric support characters, you just know that trouble at every opportunity is just waiting for a blast. My favorite must be Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman is an incredibly dead sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly qualified in everything and constantly forgets his partner for infinity of vices and incompetence. a typical plot will include some bizarre case of inevitably breaking or rotating around its highly dysfunctional household, though again and again Duckman's enemy's arch King Chicken, a professor of Moriarty in the form of poultry , hatches some devilish scheme in revenge for bullying in high school. Since I was a teenager, it was my favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever beat him. It has never been, will not be, something like Duckman. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so sharp that it is deadly and animation happens in this unique Klasky / Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand). It's an amazing, very imaginative and wild world and everything with a noirish, 1940 feel. You can never have too much of this particular bird.
