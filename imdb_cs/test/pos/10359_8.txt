This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving over-hill gang memories in the dining room that once - thirty years earlier - was their shelter; one Ho-hum duologue between two aging rock musos; the noirish abduction turned on its head and the introductory sequence (plus an epilogue) include the artist's heist like Edward Baer and the actual 'hot' possession of Anna Magloulis which has his moments. No film in which Jean Rochefort does not appear can be easily released and shines as one of the enthusiastic quintets, the film worth seeing Rochefort himself, but each of the sequences has something to offer and is definitely worth a look.
