In Lumumba, we see faces behind the monumental shift in Congo's history after being recovered from the Belgians, and we see the motives of those men whose hands have been rape and starving. Lumumba is not a film for hyper masses; it requires viewers' attention to raw, true action and complex dialogue. A small part of the main plot is shown through action, leaning almost exclusively on words, but there is a repetitive part that is the only action, and this is a brilliant move that makes the film an enlightened and powerful panorama of tense political struggle, giving birth to Congo. This movie is real. It is the crude inits depicting those in power, and those on the streets. It's an eye opening in its contents. And he moves in the passion and emotions of his superbly drawn characters. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a history buff, a movie enthusiast, or just like good stories, Lumumba needs to be seen.
