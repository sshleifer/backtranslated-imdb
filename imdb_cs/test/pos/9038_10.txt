This film was filmed, filmed and premiered in Oxford, Miss., The native town of W. Faulkner. Most of the add-ons were local. I was in Oxford and it changed. This feature film by Will Geer as Sheriff, he was later blacklisted. They were writers and actors of social dramas like this film, and Grapes of Wrath, which were the target of HUAC a few years later. I don't remember if an actor playing young boy Mallison (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was amazing in this earlier movie. And don't miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
