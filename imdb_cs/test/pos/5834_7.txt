That's hard to follow. It's not something to sit and relax. For several seasons he was holding me at the edge of my seat. People move, rape, torture and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there are excrements, vomiting and blood. Oz is a daring show. It raises problems such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and above all; -death penalty. This is, in my opinion, also successful, as opposed to one-way "Medium". Sometimes it bored me. She had some strange story lines and spent a lot of time with characters that didn't interest me. Oddly enough, I found out that Season 1 was pretty boring. If I watched it when I was transmitting it, I think I wouldn't observe it anymore. I like period 2 - 4. Season 5 and 6 are attentive, (though I don't think it should be allowed to say "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) <br /> <br /> there are so many amazing the characters they are based on. Old boys Bob and Busmalis, whom I fell in love with from day one. They said: Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues bound episodes together so effectively. Staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada also great. Also, smaller characters that were just in a few episodes or a few seasons, but left a good impression as well. My favorite are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the hardest and warmest on television. If there is something I will always remember, it's about them. There will never be another "pairing" or what to call it, giving me so much pain. That's why, when the ends come for them as well, it almost hurts a lot. I wish it never happened. I wish I never saw it. But good Fontana. I recommend it.
