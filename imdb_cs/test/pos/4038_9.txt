The "Snow Queen" is, of course, based on a fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's fairy tales - and unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this preserves the spirit of Faerie, success is not easy and not well understood by many, among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary bans, goblins, dragons and demons should not be questioned in the fairy tale; They are equally a natural element of Faerie, as, say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beyond the point of the story. The story is not bound by the modern Hollywood rules of the song: direct, often to the point where it is grotesquely linear in smaller pieces, and is obvious (at least in retrospect). With this defense against the common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, the "Snow Queen" is a wonderful film with beautiful visual effects, skillful acting and great sentiment. The only mistake in the movie was, I think, not that it was too fantastic, but that some parts of the dialogue were too weak modern, in slang and expression, in vain on its otherwise timeless nature.
