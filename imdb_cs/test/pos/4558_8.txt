I saw this film, which absolutely nothing about him and his stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I must say that this film is a comic book classic. Sometimes it's so stupid that it can only be fun. Farley is brilliant as a dull idiot who sets out on a journey with a man who has his father's right hand (as well as Spade) to find funds to save the auto shop. Relax, put your brain on the auto-pilot and enjoy the fun. A great accompaniment is the film favorites like Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
