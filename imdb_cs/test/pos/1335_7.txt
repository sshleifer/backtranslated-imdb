"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a fun action movie that is not taken too seriously. William Forsythe plays as Simon, who is looking for a rich daughter's missing daughter. She meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone - her sister. But there are evil thieves. The worst of them is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to get together to knock down the bad guys. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the film. There are also portraits of Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you're looking for a good action movie, watch it and have fun.
