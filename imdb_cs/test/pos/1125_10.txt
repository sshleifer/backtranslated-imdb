I'm so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really rich. I'm glad Casey is trying to get serious about the school, but he's still involved in the club. It's really funny to want to go into politics and to emphasize her "hopeful talent". I loved Calvin's new hairstyle! It looks more mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can't wait to see him more! I wonder what's going on between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I also like Rebecca. She's really beautiful. Actually, I think Rebecca & Calvin should join. Go for it, Calvin! Join my team!
