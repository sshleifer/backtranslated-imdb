The film is about Paul (Pálla), a young man who delves into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the "Kleppur" psychiatric hospital and his friends. Viktor (Viktor), who during his training in England began to think he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur), who took a lot of LSD and tried to fly on top of the roof, left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity, he is obbsesed with China. Oli Beatle Oli spent most of his time in the hospital, though Viktor is a little older than he says he wrote every single Beatles song and sent her telepathy <br /> <br /> The novel is better than film and covers All Pauls life from birth to his death, there is a long time since I saw the movie, but if I remember that the right movie does not cover Pauls childhood. "Englar Alheimsins" It's funny, sad and powerful if you haven't seen it! and read the first novel that makes the film better
