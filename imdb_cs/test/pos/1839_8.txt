This film has no pretense that it's great art, which is good. But it is a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it, I could do without the drama that surrounded my wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to thwart the main story of Minnie Driver's character. I think too often, Hollywood will refrain from attempting quality writing to try to accommodate a more visual drama when it is with an adult thematic film, such as this, emotional drama, everything that is really needed - and probably more believable. Overall, it is a very good offer and worth seeing.
