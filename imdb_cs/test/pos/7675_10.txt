Many of the others' comments were very informative, and I join in their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, a 1959 free movie I chose to join. I knew some of the voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was admitted to the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I'm confused about why CBS Records, Inc is available in Europe when I have no luck in local stores. Actually, I haven't seen the movie, but for years. have asked local video stores to get it. Now I know why it was never available. I add my voice to others who invoke the heirs of property and rights and agree to dismiss it, even though they are imperfect. the beauty of music and story has reached so many of us who would never have experienced otherwise.
