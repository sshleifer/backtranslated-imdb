Victor Sjöström was a master in this film, played in it, directed and even wrote the script! That's amazing. While today a few people have an idea who Sjöström is, he can be known to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of one of Bergman's most respected films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, it's a very mixed bag. On the one hand, you have to respect it because it is a very good film for 1921. The idea of ​​a Grim Reaper sitting with a dead man to discuss his pointless life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special Phantom Carriage effect is quite convincing and technically a well-formed film. On the other hand, it is an amazingly old and preaching film - something you would expect in a Sunday school instead of an honorable theater. In addition, some elements of the story make no sense. The employee of the dying Salvation Army, instead of leaving as a devotee or good, seemed like a sap - a very sad and confusing sap. Why is "in love" with this man? I miss something? So, my recommendation is that if you are madly in love with silence (like me) then watch it all. But if you are not a silent fan, this movie cannot convince you that this style of film is great because the story is so melodramatic and dated.
