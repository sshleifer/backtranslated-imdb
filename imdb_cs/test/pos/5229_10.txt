For the first time I saw this movie in video format. Even on the TV screen, the views were impressive. Seen on the big screen in its full glory, it must have blown people away. <br /> <br /> As one or two other comments pointed out, the story of the first pioneers and how they got into the terrain problems etc. on the way to Oregon is just as authentic as any movie. This therefore shows that it is absolutely useless to take freedom with the truth - something that filmmakers today should take into account - the reality is enough. The story is based on human struggle against elements and hostility to the natives. Subplots are few and simple. But the basic plot is enough. Elsewhere, I checked Paramount's rival with the Fighting Caravans. Despite having a more sophisticated plot and having better actors, battle caravans lack breathtaking scenes. The great trail should be a mandatory tour.
