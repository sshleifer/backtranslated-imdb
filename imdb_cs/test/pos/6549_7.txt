He watched Uzumaki last night and was immediately notified of two early films by Peter Weir from Australia, The Last Wave and Picnic on the Hanging Rock. They were films loaded with atmosphere, but short for real horror. It seems that Uzumaki is obviously influenced by these movies for me. It has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more immense the deeper you are sucked in by the film. He also has more scenes out of total horror, and although I don't think the movie really measures up to these two movies, it's well worth having the time of the most thoughtful fans unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair, but I have to say that the years after I saw The Last Wave, the movie still stays with me, and that's just the unsolved end of Picnic At Hanging Rock, which makes it so scary. p.s. All the people who criticize acting ... in this genre?
