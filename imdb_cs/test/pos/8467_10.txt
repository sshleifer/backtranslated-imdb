This movie is a scary but interesting movie. I'll tell you why it's later in this review. The film is interesting because it was the first movie ever to contain sound. No, it doesn't have to be an hour and a forty two minute movie, no, it doesn't have to include great action scenes, but for me it's still an amazing movie. This has sparked a well-known revolution if you want sound movies. It may be a little scary to watch because we know that everyone in this movie is now dead, I hear the voice of a man at the beginning who no longer walks Earth visibly and that the sound is cracked and broken. > <br /> I recommend this video to all who watch. This has created movies as we know them today!
