Hey Yall! The best drama is now on the Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website to see the plan and see what number is on your cable or satellite. She has everything I want her to be a TV show, a clean, family-friendly drama that doesn't worry me. A story about a man who, after losing his work, decided to embark on a great cross-country adventure. Along the way, they meet all kinds of interesting people and find themselves in the midst of all kinds of problems. This show was originally a spin off an Angel, another really good family show. Make sure you find it!
