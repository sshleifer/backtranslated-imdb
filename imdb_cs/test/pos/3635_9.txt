In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is his mother's youngest son, who cried continuously for five years. When he's a young man, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a 17-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becoming an actress. Antonia promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro she participates in a sensational TV show and promises to travel up to fifty years in the future or dies for love by a lethal machine he has invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to fix what was wrong with his travel. "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian movies I've seen recently. A refreshing and original story is a poetic and magical fable of love that will surely inspire the most skeptical and toughest viewer in a unique romance. The direction is excellent; the script is amazing; cinematography and colors are wonderful; the cast, led by Gustavo Falcão, icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with beautiful lines; The soundtrack has several beautiful Brazilian songs that are highlighted by Geraldo Azevedo and Rento Rocha's "Dia Branco". If this movie is distributed overseas, please push me and rent it or buy a DVD because I bet you will love the story that will bring you to tears. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina ?? O Combustível é o Amor" ("Machine? Fuel is Love")
