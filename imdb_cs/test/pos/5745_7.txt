When I saw this movie, I didn't expect much. I was beautifully surprised. Although the font was unpolished, it seemed, some of the dialogues were torn out and created, the script had bright moments. (My favorite line: "Life is like a rich baby, an-and I'm a diabetic, so I can't enjoy it ...".) The storyline was new and refreshing unlike some of the newer "major" -current "horror that most unfortunately, we are growing accustomed to it, and I believe that some scenes might be longer (and maybe even shorter). Excessive use of blood was camping, but it seemed to make sense in the end .... Oh, the end. The end would be a little better if they explained why it happened. (I don't want to mess it up.) It could also have contributed to a movie that's in the area "it's just an hour, how good could it be?" .
