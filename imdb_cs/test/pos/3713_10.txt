Two soldiers are an excellent example of fine film production. The director and producer took a cordial story and brought him to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography and very creative art. The relaxed lifestyle of the brothers in the back woods was captured with great detail and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle in which they were impressed. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with the hard but calm life in the backwoods of North Carolina and the even more difficult war life. a younger brother who is new on the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), on an older brother (played by Ben Allison) and a powerful colonel performance (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was very well cast. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and I highly recommend it to the audience of all ages.
