This film was full of great performances, great musical sounds that totally rid your mind. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", '06 was a sharp cat with girls and soon met Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma's House", 2000. Nina put her heart and soul into this role, and when he meets Darius, the first sparks fly and then there's a kind of hatred relationship. The whole cast of actors made him a very entertaining movie, with plenty of comedy, drama and lots of loving and cheating events. It is a very terrestrial film and at the same time shows how everyone has a life in life and is located in a small corner of this great world. Great movie, enjoy!
