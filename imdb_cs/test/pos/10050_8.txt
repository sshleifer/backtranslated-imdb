Custer Legend, la Warner Brothers Epic. There is no casting against the type here, with the gorgeous Flynn as the wonderful Custer in this exciting tribute, not just Custer, but for the 7th Cavalry Man. The story follows the life of the famous "Boy General" of his turbulent days at West Point and his last fight in Little Big Horn, where there are great freedoms with fact and we are presented with Custer, who is much more sympathetic. but this is happening on such a large scale that battle scenes alone provide employment for every extra in Hollywood.
