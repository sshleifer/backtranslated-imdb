A truly amazing, moving movie. The best quality female melodrama with lots of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Every woman can relate to the story because she is a classic: you are in love with the "true man", but he has no interest in you until someone who appears to be totally wrong and falls in love with the head. But of course it's not that simple. The characters are real and all performances are perfect. The movie is also cheerful, every scene skips the company. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can refer to each character and the action moves in unexpected directions. Great, unappreciated movie.
