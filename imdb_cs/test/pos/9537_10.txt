Maybe once in a generation film comes, that's perfection. "Railway Children" is the movie for me - a timeless classic that was shot and performed most beautifully. It depicts all that is worth in humanity and culmination in the conquest of love and belief over cruel injustice. Every feat is a gem, though Bobbie stands out and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy in front of her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine someone else in the role. The world is all the better this movie and today's kids would be better off watching it. Of course, like many young men of my generation, I was hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter and her hold was so strong when I was very lucky to meet her a few days ago - a charming smile and the voice like dripping honey was still there to send me weak on my knees, as they did all these years!
