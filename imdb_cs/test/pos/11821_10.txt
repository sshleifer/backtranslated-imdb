I saw The Cure when I was a kid, and then I loved it. Years later, I almost accidentally threw a copy and watched it again. Being a child, you do not really have the ability to cater for yourself, you are yours, it is usually your parents' privilege - but when I watched it again, I was sorry that I didn't do more to get a copy. This movie and then almost forgot about it to date. This is a really beautiful movie. It tells the story of an unlikely friendship between hard, misfit baby - who takes his allusions from his horrible, rude mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has AIDS. <br /> <br /> Right, you say. Another one of those. Tears of jerker. A bucket movie. Tail of morality. Yeah, I know, I hate you too. It's just not that. It is one of the few films that I have seen and that will rip out a very rare trick: it expresses a really sad story (and yes, a morality story), but without a single moment when it feels cheesy, forced or in any other way "Hollywood ". This shows the real relationship between two real boys who communicate as REAL children. And thanks to this interaction, the adventurous, loving figure of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "hard" man who takes charge of the kind of fraternal care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. . Together they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which seems to Erik just around the corner - so that all this silly AIDS disappears and can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> Production is top quality. Of course, what really carries this film is a performance by two leaders - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is simply overwhelming - passing on the feeling of fragility needed for ailing boy, but at the same time doing Dextera truly energetic and determined character. Shining on the scene where the boys face Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend tears him out, drives him to say what he says - and then he gets horrified on his face when he realizes what he's saying Truth: His blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, especially scenes with his mother: he perfectly portrays how this macho, the street wise child is completely frozen and insensitive when facing his offensive mother. and can't get a word to resist her because she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy from her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives an unforgettable performance as Dexter's mother, who eventually becomes the mother of Erik in a sense. I saw this film for the first time when I was at school in America and loved it - not at all about films of this kind. But the behavior of the children in this film was so real that I could easily connect with them. Ironically, the teacher who showed us this movie (a beautiful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got into trouble because some of the parents complained that they had a scene when two boys were watching Playboy ... Pathetic . Seriously, Americans sometimes get through this ridiculous phobia, I don't know. There was a hardly recognizable playboy cover in the movie, so it's not seen in schools ... how sad. Children must see this film. It's more inspiring and educational than all the "official" special schools that are together. And one more thing. I know I'm dissatisfied, but still ... Score. That's great. I am a musician and as such I know Dave Grusina from his recordings: he is a well-known jazz pianist and producer. Until this movie, I didn't really know that he had also made film results, even though I later checked that I had unknowingly watched several movies he was working on. Really, great work there. <br /> <br /> All in all, solid Ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'll definitely see it with my younger siblings - they can use this movie to watch all the standard special effects hysteria they usually see.
