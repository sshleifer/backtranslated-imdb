The Thief is a Bollywood criminal and why shouldn't he? It is driven by the greatest exponent of thriller crime in the Indian cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for one of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 Direction Vijay Anand 2 RD Burman's Music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Lyrics Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Although Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie, she certainly has babes. Helen, Tanuja, and mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some portraits.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is something other than Bond. Most of the story is out of control and goes where the story takes it almost always as confused as we are. She even flirts with Anju (Tanuja), who is trying to hit her romantic nerve just to be employed in her father's shop. Dev Anand might be in a double role - I don't want to spoil my movie, otherwise I would tell you. That's what most secrets are all about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there is a robbery to be at work - even if it isn't, or at least has a perfect alibi. We are wondering who did this, it's Dev Anand like 'Vijay' the person he claims to be or is 'Amar' someone we haven't seen yet, but many people say it's similar. Arrives 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims he is her fiancé, in a tense situation Dev Anand must prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone is wondering if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove the socks. Amar tells us he has 6 digits on one of his legs. While we are watching with twisted breath, the events that are going to unfold Dev Anand will even find time to joke. The real brother of directors Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand have a lot of movies with him, which is not the best of them, but definitely the best in Thriller Crime. There are moments of Hitchcock north of the northwest, but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, the treacherous female leader and lots of travel there are not much similarities. Dev Anand could be very well Amar except being Vijay. People saw him, identified him where he was going. There are too many to be a scam. Finally, Vinay thinks it's better to carry what's true with Amar, and it's a sad mistake. He gets too deep in it to save him from the twists of the Cinema. When I watched the movie as a child, I was definitely not having fun, the end of it completely confused me. Even now there are parts about the end that I don't like, but I would recommend this movie as well. Even as a child, I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a song in the voice of Kishor Kumar. I heard 'Rulake gaya ...' all day. Ditto for 'Aasmaan to neeche', which is set "under heaven" Gangtok (at least the story suggests that). "Raat akeli hai" is one of the most exotic songs that came out of Hindu cinematography representing Tanuju as a seducer. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helen's cabaret and we look at her. "Hothon pe ..." - now could be some better thriller song than this. As the song progresses, we are more tense than we have ever been, and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" add.
