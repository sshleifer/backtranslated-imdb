What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said a hundred times before? It's an American classic. This has produced dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is of its kind. I was addicted to the funny opening of the assembly / music to Bonaventure HOtel. Leon felt us all so young and easy. One question, however, was how did he have those two hot hookers all the time? And how did he have time / money to organize such an event? The cast is top. David Naughton is in the best place. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox (in his first starring role) is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and dork and mandatory black dude in a fishing hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox is doing bad things like trying and stealing cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and running into Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What kind of block trade is that? She's dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes, the name of a Mexican gentleman is a blade. The other one on the Flounder team has the best lines of film, I won't fool them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is Armpit. The quiet black man is also great. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians (two of them are 450 lb twins). <br /> <br /> You know the end from the beginning. But it does not matter. That's the best 80's genre. Do not rent this, BUY. and Buy Now.
