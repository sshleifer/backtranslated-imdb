Kirk and the crew visit a federal mining colony on a distant mineral-rich planet. The Devil in the Dark is Horta, a very unusual silicon form of life that tunnels through solid rock. Horta kills miners and decides to be destroyed. But how? It's hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead I focus on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its topics. Special effects are fine, but many scenes with Horta look a little absurd. Acting is quite average for TOS. Some miners are a bit embarrassed. Nimoy has the hardest part of all in Devil in the Dark, and he pulls it away. Why is it still my favorite? The Devil in the Dark is a truly anthropological and ecological moral game that is disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this big TV series bring home the importance of keeping an open mind and at least some degree of empathy with others. In addition, it includes one of the most interesting, if not probable, plot twists in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
