The film was very good. I am a passionate fan of secrets and usually find out who will be killed and who killed. Although I found out who would be killed, I didn't understand who did it. I was not satisfied with the depiction of the character of Gerda, but since the year was supposed to take place, it was possible that she would be a "cloning" woman. Please note that although these Poirot films are good, they do not have the same dynamics as the series because they do not have Jappa, Mrs. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw every actor who played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
