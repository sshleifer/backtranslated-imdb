Cinema, the best is fun. If every aspect of disagreement is to be called into question, and much of the recorded history is based on current views - often biased - one should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment. When I noticed that the plane was flying overhead in the 33BC movie, it amused me. The background scenery in "Casablanca" is absurdly false. So should I set the moans and say that the movie could not convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy great acting. Wajda's decision to cast the French and Polish protagonists was inspired. one was instantly aware of which parties each of the main characters represented. No need to worry about the authenticity of the wig. This is a powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - to have dinner - the Château d'Yquem with foie-gras; Puligny Montrachet with Entry; some Polish vodka sorbets and possibly 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with beef - and discuss political aspects of Danton until decline with fatigue. Would Danton agree?
