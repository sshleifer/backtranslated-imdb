Renee Zellweger is a housekeeper in Kansas whose dominant husband is mixed with drug trafficking. Two professional hit men - Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, murder a husband in his dining room. Zellweger, unnoticed by the murderers, testifies to and goes through a dissociative reaction, assuming a sister - the same name - Betty - who is the character of her favorite soap opera. Zellweger believes he's a TV character, so he starts his husband's car, who has a load of drug in his suitcase and travels to LA, where he hopes to connect with another character in this mindless afternoon drama, "Dr. David Ravell," Greg Kinnear . When she didn't realize she was being chased by two hitmen, she goes to LA, where she manages to contact Kinnear and is actually written as Sister Betty. A handful of men, including the local sheriff, are catching what's going on and also looking for Zellweger in LA. The end is believable and pernicious. If it sounds crazy, it's because it is. And it's the writer's responsibility, John C. Richards. It is interesting to note that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, have taken it all out with great help from the performers. This is not a plot that has been cast into a known form. No way. I give him bonus points for complete originality. Someone came out on the limb. Someone took a chance for a movie that wasn't a copy or a remake of something that made money ten years ago or fifty years ago. I imagine that the people who take part in it every night pray and pray fervently. I don't know if the film was rewarded, but it's mostly successful based on its own aesthetic expressions. It is what could be called the "first premise" of the film. You will start with a single transformation event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and her acceptance of a truly new personality, and realistically follow the resulting logical paths. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more complex example. "Sister Betty" has its logical cracks where incidents give up their credibility. For example, at LA Party, Zellweger finally runs to Kinnear, the guy who plays his ex-fiancé on television. She is overwhelmed (because she finally thinks she is Betty who has lost her fiancé long ago). She approaches Kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces herself as "Sister Betty", a character. She addresses Kinnear on behalf of his TV character, "David Ravell." The band is initially confused, then convinces himself to be an ambitious actress who insists on staying "in character" during the conversation - and after Kinnear fascinates her and the others were bored. Kinnear drives her home, and even if she kisses him good night, she still has a character and leaves Kinneare with astonishment at the relentless way she captures Betty. The next day Kinnear returns his love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, a species that is missing in "Groundhog Day". Towards the end of the night, One, Kinnear, like any other person, would realize that Zellweger is a pair of short circus clowns. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes many turns, will succeed beyond expectation. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his cheeky, nihilistic son is brilliantly refined. Morgan is flawless in her irritation. He manages to fall in love with Zellweger's image by discovering clues to her stay and activities, and finally cannot get to her. It's too sweet to shoot. After her conversion to Betty, she left a message in Kansas. "I want to help all life, be it an animal, a plant or a mineral." Who could hurt the author of such a nonsensical statement? His admiration for her comes as a revelation as he stands near one of the spotlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or maybe a good East witch - well, the characters who, like Zellweger are from Kansas, appear to Freeman and hug her and kiss her gently. It's a scene that is suddenly scary, romantic and a little scary. Once upon a time, I stood on one of the lights and threw some shredded paper into the sprayer from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by thousands of swirling bats who misunderstood glittering pieces like moths. <br /> <br /> Right. Where I was? Good. I tried to keep my room out of my way. Zellweger's performance deserves credit. Everything he does, every move, every statement, is naive and experimental. It's really a nice figure - despite the fact that Hollywood standards are not glamor girl. But - what an actress. Compare her performance as a spoiled 19th century hick in "Cold Mountain". Exactly opposite. But then everyone is in this pleasant movie. Allyson Jannings does a great job in a smaller role. Look at her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she's thinking about getting lost in the accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who wear ten thousand dollars of thin black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He laughed and said, "Oh, one of the castaways, right? Okay, how am I going to return?" Jannings doesn't answer. He just smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and leans his head mockingly. It is not a masterpiece of filmmaking, but a good, original, professional work of all involved.
