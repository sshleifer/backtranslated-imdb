We saw it on a DVD in our Paris apartment. We're here on the exchange program. We all laughed so hard that what happened in the movie happened to us! I think so, some of them were quite clich√©, but still true, I know what I'm saying. I think I was more connected to a quiet boy (Italian) than to Xavier, because I'm more of an observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France. It looks like he's cool in the movie and after seeing her last month when I saw her holding a Cannes festival. I have to look at the sequel that has just been released in France.
