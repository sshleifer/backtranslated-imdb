Author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker edited his own "Cabal" novel for the screen and created this amazing story of horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who is suspected of being a serial killer. The cops shoot him in front of Midian, on the graveyard's surface, but this is a refuge for the monsters that the company has avoided. When they claim Boone and make him one of them, it will cause consequences for everyone, including Boone's sweet friend (very cute Anna Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (David Cronenberg's most enjoyable). "Nightbreed" shows a kind of wild and twisted imagination I don't see in movies so often. For one thing, Ralph McQuarrie, an old conceptual art hand who worked on such films as the first three "Star Wars" items, helps Barker create excellent visual effects for "Nightbreed", starting with the opening credit sequence. Visual and make-up effects are sophisticated, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. Barker and the crew are doing a great job in creating this whole world with convincing characters. It is a varied and spectacular fun and it is a joy to be taken. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and fanaticism, not to mention the severe consequences that can result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great support appearances contribute to entertainment. Cronenberg radiates a lot of malicious intent and is a real gas like a bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a typical love-to-hate antagonist, rather an ugly police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley again gets buried under heavy makeup like a tired Lylesberg, and is rock solid. Hugh Ross is a great fun like Narcisse, just like Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (adding bonuses in one order). Simon Bamford, who has played "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" images, also appears here. The science fiction star John's Agar from the 1950s and 1960s is even a great camera. "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre movie worth looking at anyone who hasn't seen it. I give him a strong recommendation. 9/10
