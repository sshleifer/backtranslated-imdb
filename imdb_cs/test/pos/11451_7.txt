It's an old, old story: children have a party in an old house, demons are relaxed, followed by death and gratuitous nudity. You all know, it's still a lot of fun. Many people (all right, many horror fans who are supposed to be specific) have nice memories of this movie and it's always easy to go back to the old movie to see if it is still as good as you thought it was. Fortunately, it is. He has something for everyone (I think anyone who becomes a man). From a fun sequence of titles to fraud theft that includes the clever use of Linn Quigley's ass to "mirror" scene to demonic entertainment, it's a blast from start to finish. Girls are cute, guys are. . . . The male, death scenes are well done with some good gore effects, and unlike some horrors of the era, it actually maintains a good feeling of atmosphere and even tension throughout. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun and above all it offers some nice, weird moments that should please most of the genre fans.
