TRADE FOUR SEASON was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot on mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of only fifteen years, he managed to create a stunning set of work in film and theater, both as a performer and as a creative producer, actor and director. Although this movie may not reach many viewers, the film has something to offer. The story is quite straightforward. The man is expelled from his upper middle class family because of his emotional and economic issues and is unable to control his downward spiral. FOUR SEASON TRADE is shot by slave devotion in elegant detail, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Every subject on the scene seems to be carefully arranged to evoke layers of emotional structure. Many religious paintings and icons adorn the walls of different rooms, and they seem to be talking about Hans's desperate pursuit of spiritual meaning or direction in his life. The idea was devoted to how lighting and color were used to contrast and enhance drama. Several times during the film I froze the frame to admire the beauty of the composition. The film was filmed and the print was almost flawless and top-notch. Fassbinder employs his actors in an almost violent "anti-natural" style and does everything in his power to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial way, creating a somewhat hardened effect. "Hyper-reality" to telling, rather than introducing the secular melodrama, the actors, the almost militant lack of affection, forces the viewer to confront the film in a different way, Fassbinder's film deliberately prevents the viewer from connecting with characters. It takes and trouble, you are always outside, looking inside. This will be a disturbing experience for many, but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
