In Moscow, young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) love each other deeply. With World War II, Boris voluntarily joins the army and is sent to the front a day before Veronica's birthday and has no chance to say goodbye. Veronika is waiting for news from Boris, Boris's cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) rapes her and got married. But Veronika does not forget Boris and waits for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking romance during the war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story, including the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark. Working with the camera is amazing, with sophisticated planes and angles and long travel. Pictures of Veronica in the middle of the tanks or at the station with many figurants are amazing. The spectacular cinematography is highlighted by the restored DVD image. T. Samojlova has an exceptionally beautiful face and touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene is another great example of an anti-war film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas" ("When Fly the Stork")
