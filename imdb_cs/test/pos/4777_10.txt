This 8-minute gemstone is not only timeless, but also a milestone. It's Mickey's third cartoon and also one of his best. It's a cartoon milestone because it was the first with sound. And my good, even after 70 or more, is always so good and the narrative gives real weight. Black and white animation is excellent and character characters are convincing enough. Music is amazing, I love the soundtrack, it adds to the fun the cartoon has, no matter how thin the story is sometimes. A cartoon is funny! So many unforgettable moments like the teeth of a cow used as a xylophone and its udder like bagpipes. The characters are also engaging, Mickey and Minnie two landmark Disney characters are well expressed by Walt Disney, and Pete serves well as a "piece villain". "Steamboat Willie" is simply a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. Bethany Cox
