Mr. Bean shaped the face of a British television comedy. He proved that you do not need ungodly words or wit, massive budget, great intelligence or even no intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters you just can't forget. Some of these episodes me in stitches - yes, they are not realistic at all and they are all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the obstacles Bean broke on the road to size. Rowan Atkinson et al. you always manage to make interesting new ideas - and happy new gags - do you remember when Mr. Bean drove his Green Mini while sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that are never weak - the film was not as good as this, but Bean introduced a whole new sense of humor to the world, and children and adults will admire his enormous fun factor. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be damned - that's the best and most original British comedy. These escapades never get old! 10/10
