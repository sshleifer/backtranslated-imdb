Deep Water explores the pressures and ambitions of an ordinary person in a convincing document. Testimonies and archival footage are a fascinating view of the late 1960s and a breakthrough world yacht race. Personal clashes of duties with family, themselves and legends take place in one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. The story is mostly respectful to participants with heroes and villains implied rather than mercilessly exposed. Most interpreters are left open to the viewer, allowing space to personally address situations and characters. This film is a bitter sweet experience with a fun mix of thoughtful tension, joy and drama.
