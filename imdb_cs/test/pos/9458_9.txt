When I went to see this movie I thought it would be just another elegant swing I would have to endure with my sister. Plus too, Amanda Baynes's last movie wasn't so hot, so I doubted the movie for she's the main actress. He understood it, but very funny. The screenplay wasn't too complicated that I couldn't understand the love triangle, but was very faithful to the original Shakepeara game. I loved every minute so much that I kicked a guy two places from me in a bout of laughter lol !!! very embarrassing! I'm sure I'd advise people to see this movie, especially girls because the guys in this movie are hot hot hot !! (lol) so much that i could get the dvd.
