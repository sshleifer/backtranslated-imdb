What a surprise. Basic copycat comedy classic 'Nutty Professor' just naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men in stockings) is downright cheerful as anal retention Dr. Jekyll and sex crazy Hyde. One scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with her daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "How dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter's benefits." Operation. "<br /> <br /> Lanyon answers back," oh. * brain out !!!
