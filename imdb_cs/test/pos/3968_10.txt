When I saw this movie I expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on cheap with scary actors. I was really surprised when I found myself wrong. The film centers around Bartely or B, which have been rejected from all of their colleges - the actor who plays B is very natural and his character seems real and decides to create a pretense school to stop his parents bothering him. Lots of people see his fake website and join. The feeling that their sorrows B could not turn away from the best of their best partner. College is an ideal place to learn what you want or do nothing. The school faces opposition from a regular college that ends it. The film ends at a high level and I encourage you to watch it. Its got the drawbacks, but it's a good cheerful movie feeling with some unpredictable twists.
