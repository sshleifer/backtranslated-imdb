A surprisingly well-functioning, well-written film about a hard rockin-but-decent young man who has so much hope of a ticket to fame: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace his lead singer. The film is not very attractive and tries to keep things in perspective and does not go beyond them. you will definitely change your mind about the persistent fantasies about being in the music business. However, despite a solid dialogue, the script builds on a tried and true sample pattern and is implicated in its own clich√© in the final act. I liked it much more than the sweet fuzzy "Almost Famous". He has a nice, bitter edge to go with his heavy metal decadence, but a stronger surface might have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 from ****
