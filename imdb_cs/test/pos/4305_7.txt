Double Shock is one of many good Columbo episodes that achieves good film levels. <br /> <br /> Has all the elements we like in Columbo episodes. We get laughter when Columbo does something clumsy and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you choose to watch this episode. We also played as usual with almost perfect murder, but something about Columbo's murder problems. The end is usual, we get a story about how Columbo solved the mystery. This is another good episode of Columbo and I rate it 7/10. It is close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just One Question" - Acting? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
