Well, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see. In fact, there is not even a little "sophistication" in it. It's cruel, teen, harmless, idiotic .. And totally cheerful. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other, try to get the rent money from a single resident who is stupid enough to stay, have a whole night of drinking binge with the boys from the power station next door ... And fall into lust with a beautiful An actress who comes to avoid printing. Try it if you're a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Don't take the movie. Simple like this. <br /> <br /> * I'm not fat, that's a word from another of Rik's fab junts into the world of film ^ _ ^
