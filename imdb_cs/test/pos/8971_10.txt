Charlie Wilson's War is an excellent example of how films should be made. This film is of the highest quality and is perfectly cast. Tom Hanks plays a leading role and delivers exceptional performance. Furthermore, Tom Hanks is praised by the unique acting ability of incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly. The film is witty, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts also plays in this movie, but is easily overclocked by the other two leaders. <br /> <br /> I rated the film 10/10 and I am happy to recommend this movie to anyone interested in quality cinema.
