This movie might be somewhat boring for some people, but this movie seems very interesting to me when it comes to trying to reveal tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. Before the film, the film showed music throughout the film and this film seeks to achieve similar things by having a film-like image. Another thing is that the story is written by director and philosopher Kim, who is a well-known scholar in Korea (holding many titles - including Dr. Havard), not saying that educated people are making better films, but that The philosopher is an expert on traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit to this movie.
