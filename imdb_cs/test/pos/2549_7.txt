I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart and this movie is just as good. This piece of life is almost documentary about how life lives on the edges. Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do a great job as a 12-year-old brother and sixteen-year-old sister who live in a small room above a car shop. No parents are; they are on their own survival. Ali complements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy to the subway. Izzie completes her income by selling herself. They're trying to make money, but their own truck. One is tempted to express indignation at the fact that these two children are left in charge, and can certainly be upset that Izzie sells his body to willing truckers, but the fact is that today it exists in the richest earth globe, not in some backward country. Save the indignation and do something.
