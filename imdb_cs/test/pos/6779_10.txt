The game was made in 1996, but today it's still good. the graphics are not so hot and the actors are not oscar-worthy, but the plot is twisted, devilish and very pleasant. The dark story is convincing from the first film and continues throughout the game. We played several people together for several reasons: 1) use all our minds together. 2) not to be so scared. <br /> <br /> Play this game and you won't regret it, just don't try to find the earthquake engine there.
