My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably hopelessly mixed with the events that have occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I just landed after 8 months of unemployment and returned to school for retraining. The money was still tight, but I didn't have to choose between watching a movie in theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the feeling of gratitude and gratitude I felt back then was huge. As a result, my enjoyment of "Italian employment" was probably far from its true value. Yet, a few weeks ago, I picked him up on a DVD and watched him again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I've never seen an original (though I heard it's an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is extremely observable if you want to see modern production values ​​applied to older movies and themes. <br /> <br /> What brought me to this film at first was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the noisy, textured, and audio-friendly audio tracks. IJ opens with a crafty, witty, pulsating pattern that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brushing and quiet moments - it has won me completely since the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of chimping, pulsating sound music because Stewart Copeland left the police and started making soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs here, along with some pop remakes that range from "OK" to "Inspired". This movie is a pleasure for people who are important to the soundtrack. The film: I can marry or leave Mark Wahlberg, but it's fine as a leading man, and the film doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest "main" actor in the movie, but that's because the rest of the support cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in the small part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron, all in solid, fat-free performance. Norton seems to be mostly on the phone (rumors that he doesn't really want to be in the movie), but it's still natural, even at 1/2 power. My only casting and acting argument is the character "Wrench", which seems to be a male model that pretends to be an actor. It seems his part is blown away in the movie, and he has the rest of the chemistry with the rest of the cast (though you can blame some of it for part size and "late walk" on the character's character). If I were cynical, would I wonder who the actor slept to get into this movie in such a supernatural role? No, it never happens ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, stunts, conspiracies ... everything is brewing nicely and Gray and its production crew get along without any problems (except "Key Character") , see above). The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfactory major and minor payoffs on the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he has just lost a surprise element. Wahlberg advances to Cold Norton with the right cross, and then asks, "Were you surprised?" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there ... Of course, the film requires a certain level of "suspend distrust" to work, but if you just relax and go with it (and don't think too hard under the water cracking mechanics, or the probability that someone Will be able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via laptop, etc.) you will have a fun ride. "The Italian Job": It's a light summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it's not trying to be anything else. It's not good enough for "8" but I wouldn't "7.5".
