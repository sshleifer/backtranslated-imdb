That was my favorite movie of my late wife. I'm sorry she didn't live long enough to have a video because I'm sure she would wear it. What can we say? A great romantic story and a reflection of two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, he's a late Brian Keith, who gives us a solid performance like mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Backup is provided with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as a hijacked American widow. The big back-up also comes from the great John Huston as Teddy's plagued SecState, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis of Clint Eastwood is great as a hesitant US Ambassador Gummere; Late Vladek Sheybal with his demonically evil gaze is as great as Beshaw and another is given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen, whose faces we have seen on several backgrounds. All in all, it is a film full of wonderful romance, noting the time that is gone. Mindless story? Not at all. The issue of the great nations, which pushes the smaller ones for their own hegemonic interests, is as true today as it was then. Too romantic? Not quite - certainly not muggles in any sense. Fun to watch? You bet. I own a video and watch it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
