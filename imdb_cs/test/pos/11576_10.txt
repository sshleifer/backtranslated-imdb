Almenábar again gave us a quality film. This director is amazing and proves to be as talented and effective in crossing genres. Excellent film development in the form of dialogue and personality oddities, but also with finer details (Ramon's father's view) allows viewers to identify themselves with the protagonists. the emotional impact of events that take place deeper. Occasionally, the visuals are simple, sometimes overwhelming (dream on the beach), and I think that Almenábar's films really benefit from the fact that they also compose music - it flawlessly matched the different moods of the film. More than just a film about euthanasia, which is an important subject in itself, this film deals with the duality of a man who sometimes seems to enjoy life (albeit to a limited extent), yet the one who is unwavering in it. his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the film is interrupted by the well-timed shocks of humor that seem more fun because they provide a welcome response from the melancholy you will definitely feel. While this is clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film has an excellent work that represents the innumerable opinions of Ramon's friends and family. Ramon's father was the most annoying when he said, desperate, "There's only one thing worse than losing a child. That a child wants to die." Excellent writing, playing, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
