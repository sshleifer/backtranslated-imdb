He was excited to open hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal" but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Maybe the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This film is an exciting thriller masterpiece even without religious considerations. You can explore the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN, where the "Particle of God" or the greatest amount of antimatter is created, is an immediate guide that predicts the perfection of this film. Who doesn't love Hanks? The storyline and twists of this film are simply amazing and well-developed until an incredibly twisted peak. This film suggests a satisfactory compromise between science and religion, although there will be a lot of closed heads on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." A.Einstein
