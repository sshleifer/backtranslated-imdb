Voting for this film is interesting (at least for the moment). Those who are expecting a documentary are overwhelmed or at least not disappointed. I suppose those who gave the film 1 out of 10 are those who were expecting a war film or re-enacting the invasion of Gallipoli. So - if you want to see actors, shooting and gore, this movie won't suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without any bias towards either side (the only enemy in these events was the war itself), then you will leave both amazed and sober. I found this very moving movie, and I really liked Captain Guy Nightingale.
