Most of these reviews are dead, so I'll be cutting to other chases and answering some of the questions I saw here. While the characters look and look young (ie controversy), the actor / actress himself was 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over 16 barriers. Here in the US, it is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film will compensate a lot. I'm sorry I didn't see Sean any more; in this film at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; You know exactly what a character feels, whether he is angry, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, but unfortunately, at the end of 2006, her life was shortened by cancer. She was a beautiful and talented actress. FRIENDS VHS tapes can be found occasionally on Amazon.com, but usually for a significant price; I saw it as low as $ 60 or so and as high as $ 152 (as of this commentary, there were two for that prize). Continuing the PAUL & MICHELLE video is not so expensive and can be obtained (if available) on Amazon on average between $ 16 and $ 70 on average.
