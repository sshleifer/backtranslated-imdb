Finally, I got a chance to settle down and compare two versions of this film that is currently being played - First, a good old scum, a sleazy Embassy VHS print called SCREAMERS, and then a new fully restored Italian DVD from every new favorite media company, None shame of Italy. American ads about "men who turn upside down" are, as they all say, completely misleading and suggest that Roger Cormanized has taken over what would otherwise be a fantastic adventure of fantasy. adults. The complete Italian version is somewhat large, well designed and deliberately walking on "Dr. Moreau Island" and there's nothing wrong with it. It's a sumptuous, nice Euro Horror trip with brains, good drawing, character development, photography, period costumes and sets, etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that a 14-year-old weed is still lurking somewhere in me I got a bigger kick from the harsher, leaner and unkempt version of Roger Corman, who has a nice over the top gore, a flashy but absurd introductory segment, and then most of the original Martino movie, though, somewhat simply, to create a space for Roger's fun. The stimulation was somewhat faster, the shock sequences closer together, and you see just as fantastic the form of Mrs. Bach as in the extended Italian version. I still don't have much thought about what a particular story is about: there are a number of twists and random characters that were somewhat hard to follow. The local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminated in another fistfight between the noble prisoner of the losers and the mad scientist. I will say it: Film fans should use one of these PAL imports and look at what is actually a movie, rather than just another dirty old home video - the widescreen composition once again revealed that Martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting things. No one gets their heads torn, as in the SCREAMERS printer, but it's still interesting, and again proof that while his standards were largely confined to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman had a new good kitsch fun when he did it for him. , and they are actually better movies than they have to be next to each other. <br/> 7/10
