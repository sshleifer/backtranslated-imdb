"Footprints (on the Moon") is almost certainly the weirdest, most intricate and most typical Giallo ever made. It may come as a restraint to some sub genre fans, but this film does not represent many of the regular Giallo trademarks as a bloody murder knife (best committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), opulently modestly dressed beauty and unpredictable red herring. However, to compensate it all? and much more ?? "Footprints" benefits from the most trustworthy and unmistakable impressive atmosphere I've ever experienced in this type of film. The secret level in this movie is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you uncomfortable and frightened. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi, you have no idea what's going on or why, and this feeling of utter helplessness is undoubtedly the main strength of the film. As a viewer, you want to help this poor woman understand things that surpass her, but you just can't. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly realizes she has no memories of the previous three days. He finds a torn photo of a hotel located on Gama Holiday Island and decides to go there to explore what happened. There seem to be a few people on the island, including a lonely girl, knowing Alice, just using the fake name Nicole, wearing a red-haired wig and acting as if she came to the island to hide from the unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the nights of the poor girls are restless when they return to the dreams of astronauts jumping on the surface of the moon, and a mysterious scientist called Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slowly chasing, and especially the cosmic sub fence is really hard to connect with the rest. Alice assumes that they are just images from the Sci-Fi movie she saw long ago, which sounds like a reasonable explanation, but you feel that it is a deeper meaning and a real connection with all other events. Fans of turn-based and stylish Italian film can't afford to miss this movie. This is a psychological tour of director Luigi Bazzoni, with incredibly beautiful photos and music that changes mind. Despite the lack of violence (or perhaps that is why), the film is truly disturbing and the emotional suffering of Alice goes through the audience emotionally. Unfortunately, because it is too often in Gialli-cinema, the culmination suddenly comes quite violently and almost does not give a watertight explanation of all the unpleasant events you have witnessed for the last hour and a half. However, the content of "Footprints" will be a long time after the film ends and its strong impact increases. Florinda Bolkan is exalted as an embarrassed senior lady and receives excellent feedback from a limited support cast, including young Nicoletta Elmi. The prominent Euro-cult star Klaus Kinski also gets top-billing, but his role is only a widespread portrait. In fact, this film is much better than Bazzoni's (and much more affordable) Giallo "The Fifth Cord", so here's the hope that "Footprints" will also get a fantastic DVD-release.
