Unlike some former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of carpenters. Face to face, Christmas would never be a carpenter-free Christmas. That means I believed that the film did a good, not great job in portraying Karen's life. The movie was nice to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a bit short. I suggest you all look at getting some carpenter specials that were introduced in the 1970s. You can't believe how great drummer Karen was. Cynthia didn't catch the range of Karen's talent. Karen was also beautiful, but she had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. I'd like to see a more factual story, because Karen was more than she was seeing eyes while listening to We Only Only Begun. I have tons of unreleased carpentry music and it's absolutely great. (Her singing California Dreamin has to die).
