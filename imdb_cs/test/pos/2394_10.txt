I loved this movie, Independent Film Production. Cinematography, stimulation, rhythm and acting have been perfectly synchronized. Fred Carpenters so far the best job! The film is well written with plenty of twist plot that will take you to the big end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was most impressed with cinema. Lighting creates a mood and beauty that is usually found in a much larger movie budget. This gave the actors a big screen to start from, working their magic. And that's exactly what they did! The great performances of all the actors and each of them was well occupied in their roles. As I said at the beginning, it's a great movie and one of Fred Carpenters' best movies. You'll love it.
