I absolutely love the promised land. The first episode I saw was when I was on a mission in 2003-2005. I really loved the rich family background shown on the show. Here was a family with their own struggles, but instead of staying on them; they would love to reach out to others who had the same problems in trying to forget about themselves and go to work. That's what made me fall in love with the show. All actors; especially Gerald McRaney; has shown the true meaning of "family" that has left an indelible mark on my life. I was on the same path as they were, but it took me time to create this kind of character. I love this show so much that I wanted to share it with friends; But I was really overwhelmed when I heard it was taken from the air. I thought and still think it should BACK! So many lives can benefit from media inspired by heaven. I sincerely believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings spirit every time I see only one episode. This show really (in my book) really defined what the "Promised Land" is. It is the Love you hold in your heart for others; which will lead you to a higher goal. The Spirit of Love is one of the strongest messages in this series and all I can say is: Bring it back. -Robert
