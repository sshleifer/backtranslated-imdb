Johnny Crawford is great in this film troubled teenager coming of age in a generation that was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, occasional but honest way. It gives us a look not only at the social scene, but gives good, solid advice that applies today to morals, decisions, generational abysses, dating teenagers (some of the statistics presented in this film are stunning. Today's statistics). Seeing Billy in his younger days is worth seeing. It's an amazing movie. I realized that human nature does not change, even though hair, fashion, and language can change, people still face the same problems they have been faced with for thousands of years.
