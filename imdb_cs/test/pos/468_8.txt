I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). A haunted, intimate portrait of loneliness and the consequences that allow it to grow and turn into something darker. Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage is excellent and makes a wish that you have met these characters before they become so damaged. It reminded me of the theme of Atoms Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I Call). The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and strengthens the moments in the movie without any attention. /> <br /> We highly recommend the movie and the soundtrack.
