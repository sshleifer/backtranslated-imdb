On the Indian Ocean Reunion, the owner of the cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is dedicated to Julie Roussel and does not know her. When Julie arrives on the island to marry Louis, he waits for her on the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in a passenger ship and discovers she is completely different from the painting she sent to Louis. They got married and Louis shares her bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie, who is missing. He also found that the woman had charged her bank accounts and left the island. Nurse Louise and Julie rented an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France to find a woman, but in Nice she has a nervous breakdown and undergoes intense sleeping therapy at the clinic. He restores and discovers that a woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works in Phoenix Privé in Antibes and lives in a budget hotel Monorail. Louis breaks into his room and when he comes from the club, he says he's happy with him, but her ex-dangerous lover, Richard, blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the landscape. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie. "La Sirène du Mississipi" is the film of noir by the great director / writer François Truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. Femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is overwhelming, probably on top of her beauty and is wonderful to see her face and topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the succession of escalating the hotel's wall is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worthwhile and gives credence to Louise's passion and lust. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sereia do Mississipi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
