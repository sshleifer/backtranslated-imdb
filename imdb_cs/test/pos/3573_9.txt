Actually, I went to see this movie with low expectations because it was the only one that suited my plan. And I found it amazingly original. I commented on other Colombian movies before, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have a similar system, and always try to refer to average vulgar people, especially trying to make jokes from a continuous curse. Let's face it, the language used in this movie isn't too exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak. The storyline and pace are brilliant, and it could be extrapolated to any country in the world Acting was great and the script is one of the best ever made in Colombian soil for me. I think anyone around the world can get a good hour and a half of fun, with a beautiful bluffing black humor comedy. It reminded me of movies like snippets and more. I highly recommend and hope that more people will see it because Colombian films have become more internationally focused since last year.
