This is one of my favorite Disney movies. He has everything you could hope for in Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, ugly villain and lots of adventures. The story begins in Paris, where the aristocratic Duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until Edgar, the possessive butler, shows that he intends to leave his cats. They realize that if they have a chance of claiming happiness, cats will be out of the way. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece of the 1970s - at a time when Disney created several animations - which include songs like the title number "Aristocats", as well as "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat", this will charm the audience young and old permanent jazz.
