I didn't know much about the movie that got into me. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really pulled and held me, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The screenplay is very clever and witty and the cast with him makes great things. And the best part is that it was fun without any explicit sex or violence! If this movie comes anywhere in your area, you should look at how to stand up for this little movie, it's worth it!
