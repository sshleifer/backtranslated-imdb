I watched the premiere of "Journey to Paradise" and was impressed by the dramatic license and everyone. I lived in New York (Brooklyn) for several years and I remembered. Today, given the ties to groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see this as a warning our government does not recognize. I blame our bureaucracy and leaders for this. 9/11/01 was a new tactic to get two of our branches gov't and there is no excuse for our gov't to prevent that period. "The Road to Paradise" was just a dramatic look at the '93 insight and no one cared. Now, almost 3,000 deaths later, even years in a row, are trying to find the answer that is decades to solve.
