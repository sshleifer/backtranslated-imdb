I saw it for the first time when I was a teenager in my last year of Junior High. I was riveted to it! I loved special effects, fantastic places and a test method and a flashback method to tell a story. A few years later I read the book and when it was interesting and I definitely saw what Swift was trying to say, I think even though it's not as perfect as a book for social comments, like the story is film better. It makes more sense to make it one long adventure than to have Gulliver return after every voyage and make a profit by selling tiny Lilliput sheep or whatever. It's much more arrested when everyone thinks he's mad and DO sheep are making a portrait. As a side note, when I saw Laputa, I was impressed. It looks very much like the Royal Kingdom of Chrono Trigger (1995), which has made me even more like this mini-series. I saw it again about 4 years ago and I realized I still enjoyed it. Really high quality material and started a great run of mini-series Sweeps for NBC, which followed it with solid Merlin and interesting Alice in Wonderland.
