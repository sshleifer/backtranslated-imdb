This movie was great! I love the way he mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think that there is no possible way for you to laugh at the presented situation, yet you will experience a surprising giggle. It is wonderfully acted, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with a stylish, surprising ending. I'm not the one who says he'll like it just like I do, but gives him a chance and leases him. The DVD has great special features, including director, Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch's feature comments, and one Sigourney Weaver that gives you interesting movie information. I hope my comment is useful and you enjoy the movie!
