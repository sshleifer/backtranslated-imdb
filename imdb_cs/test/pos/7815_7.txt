"Minutka Pray, Second Die" is a quality western spaghetti with a solid cast and an interesting story. It is filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for the film in this genre. Alex Cord is doing an amazing job depicting Clay McCord, an outlaw who still suffers from debilitating seizures. He searches for an amnesty before his enemies approach him, but is too cowardly for his own good when asked. Robert Ryan brings the best performance in the film as Governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here. This movie is very good, but it doesn't look like one of the best spaghetti westerns. It's too much in style to be in the same league as one of the big ones. He has some super spaghetti, but overall it's a bit too much like an American western. This is particularly noticeable in the music score that is fine because movies go in general, but quite boring Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me of the music from The Unforgiven. While there is an interesting story, it is said to be too conventional for my tastes. If spaghetti fan and Hollywood fan had to watch the movie together, this would be a perfect compromise. All this doesn't mean somebody should avoid this movie. I've noticed a lot. As I said, it is a very well made film and I recommend it to anyone who likes the West, Spaghetti or otherwise.
