I feel that this film is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who are really interested in themselves. They may have defects, but they have no bitterness or constipation with these girls. Try to find it on TV or regular movies. It's the breath of fresh air when we see the girls are female - they have beautiful female dresses and shoes. Contrast that with clothes in stores today, ie shabby and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story has a bad thread flowing through, but that's what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know he's animated, but he still gives you the feeling that families can stick together and come out fine. I would recommend this movie to both boys and girls.
