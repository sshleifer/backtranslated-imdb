You know, it's very interesting to watch ... half of the people connected to it are now dead ... <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been watching anything Muppet was watching, but this thing is pure gold. I'm a great toy fan and this movie is pretty well placed, but one of the amazing aspects is its pace: it's not really fast child stimulation, where creators randomly decide to move a story without giving character's depth, it's just a kind of movement along with characters where they want to go. Kermit Frog is just amazing character. His voice and expressions on his puppet face are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he is popular - "can sing and do jokes too!" - but better, why he's so cute - without any effort, inspires everyone to seek his dreams. Meanwhile, he also has to deal with himself, which is an unusual theme in family films. It also contains a total set of comedians who perform here and there, some in great effect, others a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a bit overwhelmed, wasn't it?). Some parts of the movie are a bit strange. But it is very imaginative and takes the same goal from a very different direction. <br /> <br /> Move right ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
