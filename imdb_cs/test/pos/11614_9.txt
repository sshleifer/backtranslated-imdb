Karim Hussain is a masterpiece of art / gore - this cat is definitely a talent you can look at. We have a couple of longer medallions in it that blend with shorter gigs. This is all in a very powerful movie that relies on its intense graphic images and symbolism and is not for all viewers. The film begins with the short name OVARIAN EYEBALL. A very short segment that has a naked woman on the table naked. An invisible woman's hand covers a woman's back with a red cloth and a incision in her abdomen is pulled out of which the stem of the eyeball is pulled out. I have nothing much to comment on this report because of its brevity. LUMA LUMA is one of the movies that are lynches and it's a totally unflattering depiction of a perverted act committed by a disturbed man, having incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those "must be seen to be believed" type things. I will say that this film has some of the best effects I have seen in an independent horror movie, but for most of them this topic will undeniably be an unpleasant experience (not me - I live for it!)> <br /> REBIRTH could be from this movie cut together. This is the weakest segment of the movie and has a lot of naked people who bloody bloody holes in the field. Very short, but this kind of film strikes. Think P is Christ or the Virgin Mary's menstrual images. In this work is presented very heavy sexual violence / sexual violence / gory, which is definitely not for anyone who would be offended by the sacrament. Cruelty's subconscious is one of the best movies I've seen under the extreme horror banner will be a very controversial film between horror fans and the movie public in general. Some call it garbage, some call it brilliant. I don't see much in the middle. I thought this movie was pretty damn original and I would recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try. 9/10.
