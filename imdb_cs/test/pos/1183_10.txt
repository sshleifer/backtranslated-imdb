For people like me who were born long after the 1960s, we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts, one of which is "Hair". This is certainly a well done tour de force. One can imagine how it was for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when a group crashes on the side of rich people. As far as the last scene of the film is concerned, it can be interpreted as the symbolic end of everything that represented the 1960s. But no matter how he interprets this film, it is important to understand that even though the 1960s themselves may have ended, the movements that characterized them still exist in small enclaves. It is a time when people will not forget soon. Anyway, this movie is the one I definitely recommend. Milos Forman scored another great, right between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he do a piece of bullshit later like "Man on the Moon"?!). Starring John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
