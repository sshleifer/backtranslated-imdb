OK, I don't think it's a typical homosexual love life, but because when in real life are there romances, what are they on the screen? This film is well-balanced with comedy and drama, and I've been having a good time. It was a revolt to see Hugo Weaving playing a sex-obsessed gay realtor who uses his clients' homes for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And when I saw him in the Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert just the day before, she is probably one of the safest actors in their manhood. :) By the way, the plot smoothly and male ties were hooves. Thumbs up! 8/10
