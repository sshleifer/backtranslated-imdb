Mark Blankfield (from the old TV show "Fridays") plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a slightly trained surgeon who makes up a powder that turns him into a drug-spreading animal. It wasn't, of course, his intention, he had higher ambitions, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, as soon as a good doctor realizes what he has done, she's ashamed, but he's not over doing it again and running over Hollywood like a crazy sex machine with messy hair and gold chains. There are several subheadings, such as Jekyll's fianc√©e, who is the head of the chief physician at our Lady of Suffering and Pain, Jekyll's employer. And there is Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly several "real" parts and tastes for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who will make a few people rich in a complete set of organs. transplants, including testes. Yeah, humor is shabby and stupid, and overall, the whole thing is pretty tasteless, but if you're not in the gutter, you're probably gonna like it. It is also available on DVD for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10.
