Before I start my review here is a quick lesson in Australian slang that can help you watch the movie and understand some other reviews from Australia and overseas. In Australian slang, "thong" is a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word for underwear), "stubbies" is an Australian short, "stubby" is a small bottle of size Beers and "Stubby Holder" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. If you like black comedies about small criminals, then you will love this movie, unfortunately many people on IMDB with weak stomachs and without appreciation of dark humor have reviewed this movie, which unfortunately makes this movie seem more average than what it is. Many reviewers have also compared it with Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it's the same genre, it's a completely different and original style. Many reviewers also this movie went through to use Heath Ledger's dead brother characters to open and guide the story for this film, without watching the film enough close to realize that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill the heath character , this is explained in the middle of the movie, but not clearly enough for most to understand. This movie is also reminiscent of Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs in that it is a director / writer debut feature, and for debut features as well as these two movies in fact as Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs I rate this film as 10/10 for the director's / writer's debut, unfortunately, unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan, he can't meet expectations in his subsequent films like Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This movie is one that you shock uld sure to add to your DVD collection and is one that holds up several views quite easily.
