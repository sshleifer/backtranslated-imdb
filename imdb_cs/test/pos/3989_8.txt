I've always liked this movie, I've seen it so many times, but I've always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P This is not how they look in Romania this way. well, but as someone in front of me, his English must be improved. And there were fun moments and some tragic / sad parts. It is worth to be seen, I thought it was sweet that the defender wanted to find his love. I recommended you all. It's not the best movie ever, but it was nice!
