"Manna From Heaven" is a wonderfully impressive movie. Within the changing paradox of middle class values, Americans 40 years ago to the present, the conspiracy fears and hopes of an interesting scale. from the characters "Damon Runyonesque". Their struggles with moral dilemmas about "what could have been," hopes to still fulfill teenage dreams, romantic desires and "hit to big" to create the funniest movie. The evolving relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle, but clear to rely on "face to face" sexual pronunciation. His loosening of the knot in her shoelaces at the Art Gallery and their warmth in poker is excellent <br /> <br /> Scenic sharp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and accompanying cast. One of the few films I've ever seen twice in the opening run, "Manna From Heaven" definitely guarantees national distribution. Conrad F. Toepfer
