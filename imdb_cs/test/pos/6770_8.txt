You're not sure I've seen a black comedy from Denamar before, but that's pretty good. Humor is properly low-key and dead to go with some of those terrible activities. Svend and Bjarne have enough work to do for their boss because he always puts them down (in fact he mentions that they weren't clear enough to be tousled before they looked at one point). They do their best to set up their own butcher shop, and when a worker is accidentally locked in the cooler overnight while fixing the light, he encounters something that makes their butcher shop much more popular than their old boss. In fact, he was the one who sold his first "fillets", and it was partly his fault, because he served them for a rotating dinner at his house, and the guests were running around and appeared the next day in Svend and Bjarnes. Bjarne is somewhat scared of what Svend did, but he doesn't stop there. Svend has risen above his sad little existence to become someone who is new to him, which is new to him and does not want to give up, so the freezer is still filled with all kinds of acquaintances (and in one place a "little Swede from the park") ). But there are suspicions because former boss Holger thinks something is wrong. Bjarne is also being persecuted by his twins, Eigil, who lived in a sanatorium for years in a coma and whom Bjarne wanted to pull out the plug in order to receive heritage money to help open the store. When Eigil was taken from the respirator, he was revived, much to Bjarn's horror. And Bjarne is also interested in Astrid's love of cemetery work. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-groomed and so things are getting out of control. Dead humor really does, and although it can't be laughing loudly, it's definitely fun. It is somewhat creepy, even when considering pieces of meat and body parts that lay casually, especially since these two things take it all. If you're a fan of black comedies, it's recommended, I liked it pretty well. 8 out of 10.
