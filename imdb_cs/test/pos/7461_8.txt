When I found out that this was an interesting scene and read reviews, and I was a fan of Angel, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original and pretty fun. David Boreanaz is Keith. He's a hungry married man, he stays at home daddy, and in his marriage he feels a little underpaid. He will make a mistake by entering a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing it with an older man. They do whatever they can to get to bed, including begging, lying and blackmailing, but mostly trying to push buttons. The nutrition that follows, sends Keith to reel and pushes friendship to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a little skin on this matter - and he looks eager. Yes - he plays a weak cheat - but shows enough vulnerability and tenderness to goofy juveniles, which you eventually cheer for. One more thing when someone moans "oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH!", It's hard to see them as a rape victim.
