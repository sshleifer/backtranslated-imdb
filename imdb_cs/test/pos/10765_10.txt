I was lucky to see it at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was impressed by how well and how fun this amazing little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne did a great job of putting together this film, which has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and smoothly. The main story relates to the family and it is a very provocative and entertaining story in which the viewer engages in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, yet it has this commercial edge - the "indie" film for the masses if you want. The cast's performances are excellent, but Diane Lane is the brightest. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this beautiful movie and should be nominated for an Oscar. I know soon, but Lane has socks here.
