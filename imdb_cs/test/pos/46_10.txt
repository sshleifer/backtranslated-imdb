I watched this movie almost every night that was on HBO. I believe that this could be successful in the theater if the advertising that would lead to it would be as high as possible. I was absolutely amazed by the actress who played the nanny. She's an excellent actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very underrated actor and deserves much more credit than he accepted. Ebony made a nice article on it that gave him some of his proper helicopters. Lakawanna Blue, gave me an understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They were from a similar city "Philadelphia, PA", they had to have fun in juntas and so on. I would also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his call. I saw him in several movies where he played different roles, from a criminal to a doctor and has things! Overall, please mention Lakawanna Blues for video rental.
