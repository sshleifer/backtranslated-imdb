I was surprised to read the comments of the one who doesn't like this movie. It's really funny. There are definitely a few laugh lines that my friend and I quote each other. Some of these situations may be worrying (bisexuality, drugs, especially the child's curious view of sexuality), but also credible. It's about communication and misunderstanding between men and women.
