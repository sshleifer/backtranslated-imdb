I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I'm a real disaster fan and this was great. The cast was made of really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in his own league. In the same movie he can play both comedy and thriller. The story is also great. The idea of ​​being able to follow the timeline of what happens and to use this timeline to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this film brings it almost so believable.
