I've never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting, so I thought I'd do it. I found it very pleasant. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old man who works in a lousy job and wants to start doing some serious dough, so he goes and asks for work from gangster Bryan Brown. I won't go into details, but things are bad for Ledger and they get in trouble with Bryan Brown. From their on the film just gets better and better, with one scene involving Ledger hook up with a pair of bank robbers. And don't forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I would definitely recommend this movie.
