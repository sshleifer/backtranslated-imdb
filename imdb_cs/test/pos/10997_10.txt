This film is not your typical Hollywood fare, although picking is so bad that I often tend to stay away from movies rather than being disappointed. However, this little low budget gemstone is thoroughly loving and enjoyable and definitely a goalkeeper. The actors are as diverse as the characters they portray, the setting of Buffalo is charming (what a pretty city) and the story sparkles. Lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the word "f" will not hurt the least! Take the kids, take your grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I give him 11 out of 10!
