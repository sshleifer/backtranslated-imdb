Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first Angels & Demons adventure, which Hollywood decided to make after the Da Vinci Code, given that the latter is more controversial. The Catholic Church was in the first arm over the first film, but seemingly unwavering. And it is not difficult to understand why Ron Howard decided to do a piece of action that would serve as a great tourist video from Rome and the Vatican, and would probably increase the number of visitors due to the many beautiful places on the site. for St. Peter's Square and the Basilica, which was used as a scale model. So I think that with a large part of the budget for the sets, the cast file had to be reduced accordingly. Ayelet Zurer tried to enter the female emptiness left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character, who has a much larger share of the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had less to do than just wait on the wings to exchange some batteries. canister filled with anti-mass. Of course, in the book, it is feed for Langdon to talk about his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati, and the great dispute between them, but there is neither love nor his intellectual equality. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, chews every scene he is in, like Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the papal office, while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. And he plays with Patrick with such a flash in his eyes, with zero deviations, to let you know it's more than just an eye. There is no surprise for the readers of this novel, but McGregor's performance is one of the highlights of the film when Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. The book itself is rich with probably accurate content as always, and has had much more plot points on science versus religion, and the amount of information Dan Brown has researched and combined into an engaging fictional work. When I read a book a few years ago, I thought it should be a movie, it's easy to leave it and more to deal with action figures. It's sad that this movie, Ron Howard, did it at a pace that doesn't allow temporary rest. Unlike the first movie, where you had characters sitting for a while to discuss a cup of tea, this one moved so fast that it's like reading a book again, a page after skipping a page just to get to Catholic reviewers tagged Angels & Demons for harmless, because I believe it did not touch many disputes, unlike the Da Vinci Code, which hit the raw nerve in the center of faith. And if anything, this movie served as a great promotional video of tourism with a nice showcase of many major tourist sights that would attract many people around the world to visit. Of course, certain areas, such as catacombs under the Basilica of Sts. Peter and the Vatican archives, remain outside the boundaries, but walk along the path of enlightenment, which is now almost free. Nothing new for those who have read a book other than seeing it come alive, but for those who do not, this film can only make you pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a little more about the significance of monuments and characters like they are Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini, who are intricately tied to the land, but have remained silent. It satisfies pop-corn entertainment and leaves nothing spectacular to you.
