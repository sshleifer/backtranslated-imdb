By far one of the best sci-fi movies out there. However, it takes multiple views to grasp the concept of film and are able to appreciate not only a particular effect, but a major plot of the film itself. It is my own feelings that this film movie has received such bad reviews because no one has chosen the time to watch the movie as it was seen. It has some moments that you want to hurry and walk around, but there are few and far away. Hooper, who drove TCM 1 and 2 along with the remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and FUNHOUSE do their best job here. Great scores, good performances and great effects make it a movie you add to your collection if you get a chance to see it on a widescreen DVD version, which is highly recommended to anyone who is a science fiction fan.
