Sure, this film is right about it because it thinks it's based on real events at the Marine Base. He deals with an attempt to cover up with a local naval commander of unacceptable behavior by a naval commander, resulting in his being shot by his former girlfriend, Captain Marine. The man and the woman were lovers, but the captain tried to break the relationship when she found her boyfriend was married. He continued to haunt her, so he reached so far that he suddenly fired from the side. Finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife and was shot twice by her service gun and killed. The civil prosecutor decided to kill self-defense, but the Marines decided to accuse the captain of murder. Major, you know, was a decorated Vietnam hero and an old friend of the commandant colonel in the naval base. The captain also made several enemies in his motor pool command and rejected some male advances in very butch style. There is a considerable psychological cost that motivates and directs the activities of the main participants in this drama. that very capable cast gets nicely. However, the director and editor seem determined to disguise events as much as possible, with frustrating flashes and shifts of perspective. You're lucky if you know where you are most of the time. But carry with you; it is a useful story about how the Captain's war trial is evolving, and every man's hand seems to be against her, sometimes even her attorney. <br /> <br /> Verdict? After all, it's a rather exciting story, so you'll have to see for yourself. There is a "pacifist" message in the movie, but forget it. Sure, "war is hell," but sometimes it can't be avoided. We will then need those Marines, even though they are not always the best fair play champions. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy and Tommy, And Tommy's waiting outside. But it's a room for Mr. Atkins when he's on board the troops."
