When I saw the uncut version, I thought this movie was beautifully made. She caught my attention from start to finish; the tension was amazingly handed over. Nasaan Ka Man portrays a typical Filipino family with precision in their presentation of secrets and lies. Even religious culture, the human tendency to retain semblance and maintain a pure reputation is shown with a sharp liveliness in Gloria Diaz's character. There is no scene in this film that makes no sense - cinematography is excellent and brilliant writing. Even though the plot is great, I personally found it to be a twist at the end. The revelation with Jericho's character wasn't as shocked as it should be. But then maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nasaan Ka Man is a very cleverly made film. Casting was a good start, but Deither and Claudine acting was the icing on the cake. No one is missing if you are looking for a Philippine film that surprises and exceeds expectations. Thumbs up director.
