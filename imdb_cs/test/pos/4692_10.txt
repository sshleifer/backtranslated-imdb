Some people appreciate the magical elements in ROS, but they are what distinguishes this series, and the fact that the producers have really decided to wear actors in the right period clothing and armor - not anachronistic caps, multicolored stockings and plate armor! But I really write to comment on an earlier article. Michael Praed did not leave ROS to make Jules Verne! There have been 15 years between these two series. Yeah, I agree, and Michael could also agree that leaving ROS was not a good move - but it was the longed-for role of Broadway that bothered him in 84 and then the dynasty with payoffs for megabs.
