I love the movie ...! I saw it 1000 times on DVD and I can't say enough about it. It has it all, comedy, amazing action and incredible bits / fx. Samuel Jackson is following this show. I don't think there's a moment that he's not funny! "Everyone knows that if you make the assumption, you will make your ass and umption" !! F / x are great! The bridge / truck blast is incredible, although the sound is not so great when Samuel leaves the truck, the sound is off and I think what he says is invaluable !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, put audio in French !!! That's horrible! Even emotional moments are great when a bad guy finds out that Sam's / Charlie's daughter is his, he's great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Besides all the negative publicity , it kicks !!!!
