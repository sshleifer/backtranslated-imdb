First, I rated this movie 10/10. For me, it's just one of the best I've seen since I was born (I'm 23 years old, but I've seen many movies). The story is cruel, but not reality? She went deep into me and moved my intestines. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! Second, there is no "national preference" (this term is a direct translation from French) of this film. It's not because it's a French movie I put so high: it really caught me when I saw it. Besides, I don't know Marcel Carne's filmography well, so I don't know if it is or is not his best film, but I know it's not his most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis are the most famous. Third, the film is in CB, but it deals with inter-temporal problems of youth (not acne) such as love, friends and study in a modern way. It could even be redesigned by frame-by-frame with real young actors, Dolby (tm) sound and special effects (car accident), it would still be a great movie! Problem: Maybe It's a movie that young adults (from 16 to 25 years old) will see - and of course - to make their message well understood ... I said it was great film?
