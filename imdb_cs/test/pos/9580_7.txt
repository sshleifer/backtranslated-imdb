... the possibility that I looked at Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the advantage of seeing it with my mother, who came from Cork, and we were having fun watching and I learned a lot. from her about what happened then. Things like Deasy et al. how rain could actually destroy the harvest; how farmers had to harvest crops; both in the dance halls women and men really had to stand along the opposite wall before the men went forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bellows that held the fire running; how the priests actually called on the Church's donors list and their gifts, and a little about the currency that my father had then helped me by showing me the case that depicted the pence, shillings and crowns that were used at that time (which were legal tender in England also)). I did not pay so much attention to how good the film was, but I was very grateful that I had the opportunity to look at the time period that is for some Irish History, but for others, including some of our parents and grandparents is just their childhood.
