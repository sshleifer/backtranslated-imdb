There are movies that are just another version of another, not a remake, but like others, it's not. Although he speaks of a mafia, he is being followed in a different way and often seems to be just a secondary theme. I went to watch the movie in case (because the second theater was full) and I was happy at the end. It surprised me because of his black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting things to analyze. There's no classic way of making movies, it's just different and I think it's not the only one. I am also very happy because he is an Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change themes. You can also watch a new Italian style in this movie, but it is not blocked in clich√©s. I hope I will be clear enough, I know it's hard, I hope this movie can be exported from our borders, it's a good product for export. I also want to point out music, a very good soundtrack, the film needs it because of its long silent pause and is perfectly covered with this music. Many compliments to the director and thank you, the cinema needs these movies.
