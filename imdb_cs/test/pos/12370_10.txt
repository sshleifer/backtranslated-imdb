This is, unfortunately, a little known film ..... I say "unfortunately" because it is included with the "classic" American silent screen! It is a legend of a "phantom car" that travels around the world and recruits the souls of those who have died. The legend says that the last person who died on New Year's Eve is doomed to drive the car for the next year. It reminds of the sequence of "The Spirit of the Future That Will Come" Dicken's famous "Christmas Carol". The Effects of Dual Effects of Spirits (Especially When Communicating with "Living" People) Are Favorable! <br /> <br /> If you like silent movies, YOU MUST SEE THIS; it will "blow you up"!
