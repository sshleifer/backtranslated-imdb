Although slightly more than a pleasant 11-minute musical distraction (it's billed as "Tabloid Musical") EVERY Sunday is one of the most famous and most valuable documentaries in cinematic history because it provides an invaluable insight into the emerging talents of the two most talented and popular musicians at Screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. Although they are often cited as an on-screen test that produces MGM to test the adolescent appeal of contractors Durbin and Garland, whose options were this claim, which is allegedly coming to renew, is not entirely accurate. By the time each Sunday was made in July 1936, Deanny Durbin's contract with MGM had already ceased, and she was immediately signed by Universal one month earlier, in June 1936. However, the Durbin Treaty allowed the MGM to allow the studio apply the option for her services for up to sixty days, provided she has not yet started working on her new studio. As Durbin's debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, was not yet ready to start filming, MGM decided to use his option, and although officially contracted with Universal at the time, Durbin found himself back on MGM lot filming this nice short theme. Teenage Teen Singing Promising, Judy Garland. This, along with Garland's much more extensive past professional performance / training (which included performances in several earlier film shorts), can explain why every Sunday, Judy Garland seems to be in favor of Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more the lines to speak and the original song ("Americana") sing, while Durbin offers a popular classic art song, "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Sure, it would make perfect sense that MGM would like to favor one of his' own contract players over another from a competitive studio. Ironically, although Garland's character is apparently more proactive from the characters of the two girls in this short, it would be Durbin's wild and impulsive "Little Miss Fixit" screen persona on Universal, who would propel her to Instant worldwide super star as the world's first "Teen Idol" with its debut vehicle, THREE SMART GIRLS, while Garland is a more passive "wistful wallflower" teenage picture would see her generally cast in support roles opposite the frequent screen partner Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) up-and-coming Lana Turner. Not until her fifteenth MGM feature, 1942 'FOR ME AND MY GAL' (which was also her first full-grown role), Garland would achieve superior solo billing and 'solo attraction' as a true superstar that Durbin achieved. that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of both girls, because Durbin had achieved this status with public press for almost ten years. before her MGM rival. Literally at the time of the closure at the time of signing, the evidence on the screen strongly suggests that Universal was much faster to realize that Deanna was full of superstar potential than MGM was with Judy, and it is worth noting that almost every remarkable success of Garland reached on MGM, from superstar billing to playing specially written vehicles to showcase their talents and attractiveness to be invited to plant her tracks in the Grauman's Chinese Theater courtyard to receive an "honorable" Oscar "in recognition of her talent" Deanna Durbin accepted before her talent. MGM present. In any case, every Sunday is a wonderful, absolutely unassuming short music story, whose plot lines (Durbin and Garland use their singing talents to save Durbin's grandfather from leaving the town hall forcibly). organizing his Sunday gigs in the park), lectures the storylines of both Garland's "Let's Put On a Show" with Mickey Rooney and Durbin's 100 MEN AN D GIRL. Unlike Garland's later BABES movies, the short never treats an insignificant story seriously, and therefore its "11-minute runtime". True, the true magic of EVERY Sunday is the observation of the remarkable performances of talent / screenings Durbin and Garland at the very beginning of their legendary career. Both girls, even at this early stage, had remarkable visuals and were absolutely natural and unaffected in their presentation as singers and actresses. Garland quite explodes from the vitality screen when it literally hits the lyrics of "Americana". As she bears over the number with the appropriate hand gestures, Judy literally seems to be chewing on the lyrics of the song when she screws her mouth and bugs her eyes in her intense eagerness to show what she can do. In contrast, Durbin's performance "Il Bacio" is much more spoiled and subdued. Though fully suitable for her "classic" selection, Durbin van Arditi Waltz is much more of a traditional "stand 'n sing" variety than Garland's physically emotional turn. However, although "miniature diva" Deanna does nothing to draw attention to herself, with sincere eyes, dazzling smile and formless childbirth, she easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" Judy, and their gorgeous duetting "Americana" in the short is the finest doing one regretting it more that producer Joe Pasternak was never able to implement his dream of pairing Durbin and Garland in a musical feature film (because Universal refused to borrow a "number one Asset" Durbin out). An invaluable documentary about the emerging talent of two remarkable and unique talents. Look at this if you have a chance!
