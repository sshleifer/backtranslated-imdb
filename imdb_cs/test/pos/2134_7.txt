This great movie never appeared in my city, so I wasn't able to watch it until the late 1980s when I captured it on German TV. I waited for something unhappiness and instead I found a well-functioning western with an excellent location. The tiny trumpet couldn't really hurt her, and in this 4-hour movie it's not nearly a boring moment, so I hope to see myself on the big screen again. What a spectacle it would be! Don't miss it if you have a chance. Unfortunately, the cruel treatment of "Heaven's Gate" when it was opened destroyed Michael Cimino's career and he moved from open-air ("Year of the Dragon") to the boring ridiculous ("Sicilian") and screechingly stupid ("Desperate Hours").
