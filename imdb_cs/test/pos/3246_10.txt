This film gives you more idiots as Australians act. Even though The Castle is a great Australian movie, it's a little outside. This movie is by far the best Aussie movie I've seen (yet seen by Dirty Deeds yet) and probably would be my favorite movie. The thing is, if you haven't seen it, go look. If crime / action / comedy is your thing.
