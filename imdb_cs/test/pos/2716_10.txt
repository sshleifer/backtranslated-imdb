I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite the recommendations, so I destroyed the film as a clich√© of extreme emotional dramas and top acting. Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come and sweep you off your feet. The film grabs your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to relax after that. Aparna Sen did a great job when the viewer stuck to each movie. Impeccable character development, "fair" emotion and mysterious ending to match it all ... <br /> <br /> I have renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays schizophrenic Mithi. After that, Page-3 and Mr and Mrs Iyer again beat expectations. Role of prof. Anjali is very well developed and Shabana has complete justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman add an incredible taste to the movie. <br /> <br /> I define "shower moments" as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you endlessly think about in your shower until your wife / girlfriend hits the door. 15PA brings many "shower moments", especially an interview between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is careful when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. He immediately brings Anjali's personality to the audience. The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too Western for the Indian audience; yet, it adds elements to support the film from "good" to "big".
