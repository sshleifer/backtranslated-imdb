This is an incredible movie that starts slowly. It leads you to imagine it as a typical Maudlin family drama. Then, in the second half, it is a conspiracy that totally transforms it into a deep global story. no reason to stick to this movie. Especially beginning with the other half, you'll find this movie an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler here ************ * I have only one movie complaint. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring war as a force that changes people's lives. This was implied all the time, but it was supposed to be something about the importance of the fight for MDS.
