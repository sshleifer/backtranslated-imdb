Huge fun both in the movie and as an excuse to sit and play the game "oh it's whassis name". Every star of the golden age of English movies seems to be in this and it was a pleasure to see them. And the biggest of them, Richard Wattis, was as huge as ever. There is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely, there is also some wonderful jokes and comic moments, but the key to this triumph movie is the characters in it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six-grade Scottish cattle can be the director of a girls boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard, he is the star of Joyce Grenfell. It's an absolute one-time thing and brings a smile whenever it's on the screen ... its rolling pavement and plum accent is perfect. And for those who play, it's a whassis game, you can even watch Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look carefully.
