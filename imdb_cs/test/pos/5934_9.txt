Shawn Michaels Edge-8- It's hard to believe that Shawn Michaels is in the opening match, yet a great match between the two men, Edge, whether you like it or not, is a great performer in the ring and Shawn Michaels is just ageless about his performance The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2 OK, after a good opening match, now what a lousy match. The Undertaker made some great matches in the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match, but it's so worse than the match. Kurt Angle vs. Kurt Angle Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's all right, I feel that all three men could get a better performance, that's really not shown at best. Randy Orton vs. Randy Orton Triple H. The World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H gets a clean victory, you can believe it, will surely marry Sledgehammer, but will not use it. Randy Orton did great when he acted like a concussion, but as he got into a concussion, he's really ridiculous. I really liked this match, it was the best performance I saw from HHH forever. Royal Rumble Match-7- It was very fun and I usually don't score royal rumble match this high. The winner is again very predictable, but it has had a lot of moments that have been very fun to watch Segments with Flair and Guerrero are cheerful, the best segments I've seen in a while. Overall, this is a great PPV and must own for the fans of the match.
