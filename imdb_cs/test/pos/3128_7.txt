Western can be divided into many sub-genres. One of the most extensive divisions is that between urban western and Plains Westerns. Most Westerns are a combination of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have images such as High Noon and Rio Bravo, which are almost exclusively in the settlement, rarely embarking on a real environment. At the other end you have those like the Wagon Master, where there is hardly a homestead in the desert. Director John Ford normally thrived on a "bit of both" westerns, filming interiors Emphasizing their low and limited attention, and then unlike the widely open exteriors that seemed exciting and dangerous. The car master has a typical scenario of Frank Nugent, with some interplay of experienced oldsters and green young people, but still introduces some new challenges to Ford. In this picture the dangers do not come from the roughness of the landscape, they come from inside the group as Clegg. What's more, the absence of real inner scenes means he could lose his influence outside. However, Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. Shooting scenes from camp or cars, so the frame is surrounded and we get the same sense of enclosure as if we were in a real interior. In fact, compared to other Western states, too, it does not impose too much space, because the car path passes its way through the canyons and passes, instead of crossing solid and empty plains. One of the few moments that throws the landscape wide is when the Indians are seen and there is a possibility of threats from the outside. Wagon Master offers some surprisingly spectacular moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the unpredictable cast. Harry Carey Jr. he has formed into a fine actor like his pa, and that is one of his better early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointed in She had a yellow ribbon, but she seems to be fine as a character with a little sass, and is actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won the Oscar in John Ford's Dirty Wrath, ten years ago, appears here with the only function of running a running gag in which a faint old horn sounds. Yet, with her great timing and movement, she does the job. Francis Ford, in one of the many roles he played in his little brother's film, is at his bold best place. And now we're at the lead man Ben Johnson. Although he was by no means a bad actor, he never became a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his carefree ride and carefree drive, he was one of the most authentically "Western" players. And that brings me to my last point. This was probably one of Ford's personal favorites, despite the fact that it seemed quite unpretentious. The Wagon Master has no great theme or dramatic intensity, it's just a genre that plays alone. I think that's what Ford loved. It's a picture for Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jrs, not John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small range but worthy of class.
