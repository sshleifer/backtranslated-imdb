This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or "cowboy" here. The appeal of the film is based on careful manipulation of the atmosphere and theme. It is a Gothic story that takes place in the Civil War, and as such the "action" or lack of film takes place in a house inhabited by Southern Belles of all ages and shapes. Horror comes from looking through the whole story through the eyes of Clint Eastwood. Seeing him imprisoned in a house and captured by women is really a "charming" experience. And who is "deceived" here? Are Women Deceived by the Incredible Look of Eastwood? Are we, the audience, deceived by both his sexual attraction and the potential deviant sexuality he deletes? Or does it refer to what the director does here - he keeps us fascinated by the short space, just to (maybe) let us go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most spectacular and disturbing movies I enjoyed watching.
