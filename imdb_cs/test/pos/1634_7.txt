Before I saw Angels & Demons look at mold today, I got rid of all the uncertainties that could distract me from enjoyment; a huge amount of hatred of Dan Brown, the fact that Dan Brown wrote it, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all posters. I went open-minded and expected it worse, but instead I got a 2 and a half-hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that all means good value for fun. The film hangs freely on the novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) flew to Rome after the sudden death of the Pope and the re-election of the Papal Conclave. Organizing all this is carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). Soon, however, he soon learns of a new threat that lies in a secret brotherhood that makes his presence known, a time bomb that the Vatican is now targeting, and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Using his intelligence (and believing you will hear the LOT), Langdon's job is to find and save them using a mysterious path of lighting. CERN Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) is also a co-creator of anti-matter. The film itself runs unevenly. One minute, Langdon and the Swiss Guard accelerate to save a branded cardinal, the next minute bored with nonsensical information about every random object that goes through, which seems to slow down the expected action / thriller sequences of the book. This makes for an interesting reading on paper, but it can go in both directions on the screen. The character's character is decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor makes a compelling performance as a quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, a famous accent. Tom Hanks is a bit more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last appearance in the average Da Vinci code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the direct leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance is worthwhile, and instead of participating in the story, they are simply eliminated as assets. However, Angels & Demons achieves what DVC could never do; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfactory explosions, beautiful props of St. Peter's Square and the basilica (including many churches) and a throbbing bomb counting down midnight. Ron Howard does a decent job of managing this second adventure in Langdon, this time with great criticism and almost completely exchanging a boring dialogue for tense chases (almost). While newcomers might call it "National Treasure 3" with a much larger threat, there are still enough contagious tensions / thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe. It may feel different than drastic changes to movies, but due to the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does extremely well on keeping the viewer locked up on the screen this time, rather than on their sleepy shoulder. Good adaptation between books that appeal to and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
