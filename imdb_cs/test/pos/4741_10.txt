After watching "Waco: Rules of Engagement" I just sat in disbelief in what I witnessed. Big FBI cover, gung-ho / massacre trigger of happy government agents? I clearly remember Waco's distance, I was 17 at the time and I was watching it all on CNN. I remembered how I thought about all the children when I watched Mount Camel compound burn in April 1993. I remember being sorry for the children, but I clearly felt it was the fault of their evil leader David Kores and the other Davidians. Gazecki's film shows clearly and without doubt, even though he is concerned that the FBI has been lying again and again. I think this film was a great contributor to the reopening of a new incident investigation in 1999. The outcome of this new investigation was, in a sense, predictable, a judgment based on a fact that was as gray as the facts that Davidians submitted. I was very disappointed with this verdict because, as far as I know, I did not consider all the lies, disinformation and evidence that the FBI and other officials were covering. Why is no one being prosecuted for preventing Texas Rangers investigators from working? Why was they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and burn the mixture shortly after the incident? These are the questions the government has not given me answers to. And children? In this new investigation, I was not informed who was responsible for spraying CS flammable tear gas into a compound with many dangers to ignite this gas and found no answer to whether the muscles of the children had decreased due to the effects. gas while they were alive. If they did, I would surely think that Janet Reno or who was at the head of the raid should be charged with murder or mass murder. The question raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is; Was it a direct plan for the leadership and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building with intent? (a plan that would be met with 112% efficiency) or were the responsible officials so incompetent that they were unaware of the consequences of their actions? They're both just as scary. Even though the Davidians set the mixture on fire, the officials in charge certainly gave them the opportunity to do the job. If the officials in charge knew how they claimed that Davidians would set fire to the mixture, why f? Did the tanks make all the holes in the building that got into the furnace, and why don't they have plans to deal with the fire they knew would happen? Dark Questions That Will Not Go Away The ultimate and most relevant issue of this film is the way in which Davidia's government demonizes demons through the media that just keep it alive. I remember clearly the resistance I had in the evil Davidians I had seen at CNN in 1993. Now that I am older, I see a clear line of communication that comes out of government every time they prepare for a civilian massacre. goals. Demonstrating people with similar words; "They have different illegal values ​​then we" "They have no freedom" and "They are a threat to our freedoms and the way of life" makes them so much easier to kill ????
