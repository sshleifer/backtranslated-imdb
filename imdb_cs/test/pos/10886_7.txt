This game has cartoon graphics, not too much violence and really short levels - then why do people say it's so great?!? Because you are always interested, you will be captivated and refused to let go! Try to find a damn flight recorder for a few hours, try to figure out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, etc.! Levels are short only when you know what to do - until you spend hours trying to find out where to find correspondence, where to find helicopters and so on! And you will have fun all the time when you do it! Well worth the rental!
