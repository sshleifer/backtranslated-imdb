"The Last Frontier" is a superb western that overcomes numerous weaving deficiencies in his story of hunter Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationship with the army, especially Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to Indians, Jed, Gus, and Mungo, he has adapted to the life of "civilized" fortress life at the edge of the "last border." The poison, who was brought up by Gus, inspires and looks up to the "older" Gus and Mung, and has a particularly difficult time dealing with "civilization." His real problems begin after being heavily attracted to Colonel's wife Corrina. Colonel Marstonis is a ruthless man who threatens everyone around him with dreams of a reckless victory over every opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed by her station and a sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he can be, and Jed for what he is. In the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and sympathetic man, torn between his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the Colonel's ruthlessness. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (as well as fun) is that in most cases the weaknesses and strengths of "The Last Frontier" EXACTLY are the same elements (forget the invalid title and dated music)) <br /> <br /> First scenario. Almost all subplots (particularly, the unscrupulous colonel) were made better elsewhere, but rarely were assembled with such eccentricity. Just as you THINK that you know what happens next, this is going in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Last Edge" of the movie "Production Code" (back on the day when the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the factor of adultery was processed in such a mature, tolerant way. I expected either Poison or Colonel's wife to be rewarded for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed film did not take advantage of this expectation to create a less predictable end. Second, casting. Mature is at least ten years old to play the role of Jed, an innocent wild individual who grew up in the forest. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "The Man Who Raised Jed" is actually five years younger than the older. However, Mature is very cute, playing a character who is an innocent civilization but is by no means stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played a role at the time (most notably, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could play Jed Better. Preston (also known as Mature's junior) plays Colonel Marston, lacking the tics and influences one would expect from such a driven man. However, Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor that someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a ruthless fool to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly smart choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair died blonde, and that achieves the same effect as Winony Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow"). This means that I felt contrary to the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have significantly different skin tones and shades of eyes. In addition, Bancroft has always anticipated a toughness that borders on hardness (but here blonde hair softens). This allows 24-year-old Bancroft to stand at the tip of his finger, both with a 40-year-old Mature and a 37-year-old Preston; Yeah, it could be Colonel's wife. Madison walks carefully and balances like Riordan, working with a complex role and sometimes ugly dialogue. The game, which is similar to John Wayne's role in "Fort Apache" Madison, has more skill in it. <br /> <br /> The movie has a friendship of Silverado. This alone is worth seeing. It also has an unforgettable performance, beautiful scenery and great action and direction. I just hope there is a letterbox version available (many of which have been lost) because this movie is fully utilizing this format.
