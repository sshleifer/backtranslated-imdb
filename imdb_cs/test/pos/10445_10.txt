It's like your usual T&A teen movie, but the sentiment is incredibly grim. If it were today, it would be considered an artistic film. This goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are cruel and cruel and unsatisfactory. The whole teenage flick formula is being followed, but nothing appears the way you would expect. Imagine a director's cut "It's a Wonderful Life" where James Stewart couldn't return to the real world at the end. An incredible film that cheats all genre expectations. Then you feel dirty: there is no redemption for the characters. I'm impressed that it happened. A detective story from the 1980s.
