Many comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I think it's only secondary. It's really about life in Japan, and it really succeeds. I've spent several years in Japan and I think the reason this movie didn't do well is that you have to do something. have experienced Japan. I looked at it with a well-traveled friend who had never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My answer was that these events were absolutely unprepared truth about life in Japan! I think this film is definitely worth watching, especially if you have lived in Japan or are interested in it.
