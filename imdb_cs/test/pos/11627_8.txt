I have to shake Barney every day; Well ... I think there must be reasons. First, I believe that our children are not stupid, they are just children, but they know (my 1 and a half year old son "chooses" what to see), what is nice or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your children MUST know the reality, what is it? Maybe ... or maybe not; we (adults) have a responsibility for what we want for our children and what we should teach them. Drug Dealers Movie? news about Middle East massacres? Of course, children must know that there is a real life, but ... they are children; Give them some mercy. What do you want for them? If you want to have children trained on arms or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, save them a deadly weapon, kill Bill, any manga anime, tell them that Santa is spoiled to enter the chimney to break them. I want an illusion for my son (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Barney and Friends are the best, in fact the show has a lot of flaws, I read more comments and I agree with most); perhaps happiness is made up of dreams or illusions. At the very least, I want to teach him to grow without fear, but to learn to think and believe that everything is not a serial killer or a kidnapper for which to grow. At the very least, he may be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, don't underestimate your children; they know what they want.
