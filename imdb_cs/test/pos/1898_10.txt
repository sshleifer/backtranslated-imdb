Yes, this is one of the greats of the black action genre. This confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching a disturbing pitch, even for a genre fan) is not your park's shaft. The wonderful pieces of the comedy Rudy Ray Moore stand up that they don't seem to be funny, at least not a white boy like me, but great in context. Much better than his different sequel, "Human Tornado"
