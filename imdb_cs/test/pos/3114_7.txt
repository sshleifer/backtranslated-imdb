George Cukor is and will always be one of my favorites. The hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Sugar as much as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, and yet look at his filmography. From the Sparkling Comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Ribs" "Holiday" Psycho melodramas "Gaslight" "Double Life" Great Half-West "Heller in Pink Stockings" Not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Traveling with My Aunt" actors, never caught in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness that observes the "rich and glorious" flashes of the old master, which are still very much evidence. For the first time in her career, Candice Bergen sees a stunning comic about to stand. Jacqueline Bisset is returning to Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner stepping in, teasing us, promising something spectacular that will eventually take place in 1989 with "Zero Apartment", Meg Ryan, because Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan. As tired as the formula, it remains Cukor's film and for what I collect one of Almodovar's favorite movies.
