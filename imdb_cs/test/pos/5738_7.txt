A group of teenagers decide to take a sleep at an abandoned school where a terrible massacre took place 27 years ago. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the defeat is still lurking in the corridors of the abandoned school and is not satisfied with their presence. This film is not like most modern teenage puppets we've seen. It's much darker, much more exciting, no wise murderer, and so on. It's not great in terms of making a movie. The activity is below average. Writing was bad enough and clich√© enough to contain randomly thrown links to American horror movies, others that didn't make sense (like ... "Did you see Scream 3?" so it has nothing to do with this movie). But, hey, this is a slasher movie, you are part of the fun. Also, the underutilization of the characters was heavily exhibited in this film. There were six main characters (not including security guards) and, being honest, only three or four were really used. Two characters (token black black and some other girl who wasn't important enough to marry the label) barely spoke: I'd estimate a total of five or six lines between them. Also, girls (other than one) were not created well enough to distinguish them from each other. They could exchange each girl repeatedly throughout the film, and I wouldn't notice the difference. However, stimulation works well because horror starts right from the start and rarely stops. The atmosphere is well used and the direction reveals some really cool moments. . . Although, the overall look is a little cheap-looking due to what I suppose is a low-grade camera device (and traffic). The end, even though I liked the idea they went after, was pretty bad. He felt rushed and without explanation enough to be effective. With the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing, they could spend a little more time in the end to make sure they didn't feel like a random event thrown for any good reason (which is the fault of many modern horror movies affected). However, overlooking a few troublesome problems and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film, rather than the end, it's actually a pretty good modern slasher that should be checked out, especially if you're a Spanish fan and / or atmospheric horror. Mandatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There's a little blood and gore, realistically done, but not buckets. Violence is very well done, not excessive, but quite brutal in points. Sex / Nudity: A little, and with the hottest girl in the movie. Cool Killer: Well, security guards are hardly considered "cool", but this guy is pretty bad. His gruesome smile was freezing. Scares / Suspense: Voltage is superior. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely scary moments that have melted the jump of fear and scary atmosphere. Mystery: None at all, really. Awkward Dance Scene: Of course: between a couple of guys and a half-reluctant woman in flashback. <br /> <br /> - The classic movie quote: "One more trophy". <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 7/10. This may be stretching, but Session 9 fans would just like to check it out for a similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
