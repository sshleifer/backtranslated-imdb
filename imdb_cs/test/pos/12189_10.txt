After Lestat slept out of total loneliness, he woke up from a 100-year-old sleep to the sounds of new music he wanted to be part of, and the band "The Vampire Lestat" was born. His desire to end his loneliness and his "livelihood in the light" attitude along with his music, anger his fellow vampires and awaken the evil that has been sleeping for thousands of years. This film is not for those looking for a real adaptation to the book. Those who have read the books and expect to see them on the screen are disappointed. This film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the film "Interview with the Vampire". There are several holes and irregularities, but as a whole, this film was satisfying. Stuart Townsend recounts Lestat with sensuality and sexiness missing in previous movie. The relationships shown in the film were very sexy and hissing. As a film, the story forces you and attracts you. Casting is amazing. He loved this story and the film. If you love the warmth of sensuality and sexual tension, you'll love this movie!
