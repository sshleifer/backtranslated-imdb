Evidence that it is not necessary for the film to have a deep multi-layered story and other sophisticated elements that would be a good film. Although the story could spread in many ways, especially in a more sociological way (people long for money), it seems to be just as it is. Thanks to many sudden changes, the viewer gets to the end without unnecessary complications and without the viewer leaving his eyes on the screen. But acting is not so good for me. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, others were average or even worst. In some scenes, they stared blankly in front of them. Except Lindsey, who was more convincing. It's a really simple movie to remember and enjoy. <br/> 7/10
