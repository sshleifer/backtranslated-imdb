There are 3 of these movies, all similarly created and each very fun. Red plays radio Miss Wally Benton, aka The Fox, who plunges into real life crimes with her fianc√© playing your typical war girl next door, Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-piece and gags are stupid and probably in the forties I was expecting. But like many, they actually made me laugh aloud, which was at least unexpected. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong presence on the screen, surprisingly saying, because I grew up with a much older version of a man who is really a spell in my amazing year. I have to get these movies moving, even if it's in the mood of this kind of nostalgic fare. I almost thrown into the light, but in fact people wasted and beaten and dare say that the tension is sometimes above average. As with most movies from this era, PI (politically incorrect) scores for reasons you can imagine. War is funny, I think, and so again these movies. Watch them, watch them all.
