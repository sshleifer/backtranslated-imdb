The film is not half as bad as people want you to think it is. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's the last Laurel & Hardy together and isn't it their best? Or is it because of the lack of Laurel & Hardy regulars? Or because Hal Roach or 20th Century Fox studios are not made? Definitely true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring it to the 1950s. It is also certainly true that the film is far from their best, but honestly, the film still enjoys good, making this movie also far from their worst. It's not the best farewell movie that can be imagined, but still fun and good-bye. Both of them left the movies after completing this. The film still contains some great grotesque moments and the chemistry between Laurel & Hardy is probably still very present. It also makes this film better than most of their movies together since the 1940s. Quite surprisingly, the slapstick humor still works as well as it does, considering that the slapsticky comedy days have been over, sometime since the 1930s. The story may not be as fun as him. It could be, and it has too many sidekicks and characters, resulting in the film losing time for the boy. Too bad because they are still the ones who really carry and make the movie. It is sad to see in what poor form Stan Laurel was at the time of making this movie. He really looked sick and old, which of course was. He was already over 60 years old. But after the operation he fully recovered and still lived another 15 years before he died in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. Funny, though not perfect, farewell to boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of three decades of fun, funny, quality slapstick fun movies that are still being watched and loved by people around the world. <br/> 7/10
