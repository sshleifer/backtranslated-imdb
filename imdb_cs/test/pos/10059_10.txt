Why do they all feel that they have to constantly reduce this film? It's cute and funny (exactly what it should be). Madonna didn't want to show up as Oscar Calliber artist with this movie! She only did what she called for the character, and did it well. I loved her in this movie; it is my second favorite movie of the Madonna after Evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's no better or worse than any 80's dude. Don't take it so seriously to all critics, and you can talk to him. Madonna is a goddess !!!
