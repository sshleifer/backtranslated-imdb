Forget all the spy movies you've ever seen - it was life in the USSR and still in many places in Russia and former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of a life of leisure as the West imagines; its reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father and ubiquitous alcohol. And her future prospects are not much better. She finds a man and tries to fix life together, but he is affected by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this film is brilliant, sits comfortably in a society of post-apocalyptic films, but of course with no special effects; they just walked in and filmed anything that happened in front of the camera. Forget your stereotypical, cold Russian spy movies. This is a real deal: people are passionate, alive and present in a way you will never see in Western drama.
