Although I am not a golf fan, I have taken a sneaky look at this movie and loved it absolutely. Historical environments, shameless class honors and the vision of good and evil on both sides of the dividing line gave me attention. The actors and their characterization were fascinating. And I was at the edge of my place during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but also easy. Towards the end of this film, "Seabiscuit" came strongly to mind, though "The greatest game ever played" is a far less complex story than that movie. In both cases my interest aroused the fact that the events actually happened.
