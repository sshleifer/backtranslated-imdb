It's not often that the TV series catches me from the bat; a recent chance to take a pilot for Surface stuck me to the seat for the episode, after which I immediately embarked on a frantic search to learn everything I could learn about this wonderful series. To my commotion, I found out that he was canceled after only 15 episodes, despite his strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. Such a pity. Since then, I've got the remaining episodes and found that the first 5 or 6 are the best TVs I've watched. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as commented by another reviewer, LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge surface. I imagine I would watch him every week that I would be shouting with tension and just enchanted, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. I grew up, I always heard that it was how morning serials did, ending with a huge cliffhanger, to get the crowds back to the theater for the next episode. Well, it seems for some reason or other suits have decided to kill it off, and apparently the people behind the show must have seen writing on the wall because after episode 6 things will definitely turn to worse. I wouldn't say episodes actually become BORING, but a lot of conspiracy elements will become a clich√© and I must say that the last episode really let me cheat. I just wish the exhibition creators had a fair chance. First * ONLY * was the first Stargate SG-1 season to resonate, feel very "true", soulful and heartfelt. The surface was a great series, and maybe someday, some well-heeled TV lover will see all the spills of emotions about canceling the show, and bring back this show. At least we can hope. :)
