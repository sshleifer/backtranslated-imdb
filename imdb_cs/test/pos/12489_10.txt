The director loves the actress and shows. The actress lives in a character we love at first sight and sound. The character loves her jealous, unprecedented husband and loves her. His childhood friend secretly loves his wife, and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks her attention is beyond the secret love of her husband. Then there is a murder and an investigating police lieutenant who only loves his poet's son and disagrees with his company taking the above-mentioned characters who have had unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one or else, deciphering the mystery with some of the most accurate and accurate procedural details that have ever been captured on film. And then there is the atmosphere of post-war Paris, where coal is in short supply, the music is full of erotic desires and angry memories, and innocence has long been washed away by rain. All in a magician's environment whose tricks don't always work, dogs that walk on their hind legs and express criticism of music, hungry journalists and exhausted cops. And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who have been directed through some very bad ye ars to come full circle, a man who is in love with his main actress and who, with full justification, was a respected friend of Picasso. I saw this movie often and love everyone and that.
