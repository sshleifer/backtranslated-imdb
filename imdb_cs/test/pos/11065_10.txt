I gave this movie 10 simply from my ill obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think she was the best actress who ever gave this country her talent and all her films are absolutely amazing (even if they're horrible) because they have SHE. If it wasn't her and Vivien Leigh (as it was originally desirable, I hear), I'd give it 9.0 simply because I love Viv, but probably not as much as I like Ingrid. And any other actress would do it maybe 6. It's a good story, two wild people in love with a society where it's bad to be bad. It reminds me a bit of GWTW except snapping with a more highbrow attitude. Gary Cooper is very nice as usual and his voice, of course, never changes the whole movie, but the Ingrid flock makes it so amazing and lively and 20 times warmer than it should be.
