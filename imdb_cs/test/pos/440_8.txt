Although it does not look promising for a long stretch, Renoir's French Cancan will end up in a carefreely charming film. The story is a cliché: a girl in lingerie, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), discovered by nightclub owner Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker's friend and drops her present girlfriend, both of whom return for their former lover. Nini has to decide whether to return to her humble life with a baker, continue with the show with her employer, or become a princess, as the prince falls in love with her at one point. I am glad that the film did not go beyond the most obvious choice because it will certainly have a smaller film. The film ends with the opening of the new nightclub Danglard, the Moulin Rouge and several beautiful numbers of songs and dances. The first, "Complainte de la Butte", which also provides the basis for most of the music scores of the film, is simply one of the most beautiful songs he has ever written, and Renoir wrote it himself. If you are a fan of the Baz Luhrmann 2001 Moulin Rouge !, you will know the melody that comes close to the beginning of this film, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although not very prominent in this film, everyone I know who owns a soundtrack loves him. In addition to having one of the most beautiful songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leaders I will ever ever grace on the screen. It's hard to fall in love with that girl. 8/10.
