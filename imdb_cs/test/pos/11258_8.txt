When I saw the MTV preview, I had no intention of watching wastage, but since I had nothing better to do or watch on Sunday night I watched it. a very good movie considering it was made by MTV. One thing that attracted me to observe was the Pheonix summer, the sister of the late and magnificent Pheonix River. I suppose talent runs in the Pheonix family because it was good, and so is Jaquien even if they are River. Nick Stahl also gives great performance as junky. There is nothing else to say about wasted. It was a dark depressing and insightful look into the life of three small urban junkies. I recommend it to those who like the subject. 8/10
