I got a DVD of public enemies and expected it to be the 2009 version, but it wasn't - it was! Sure, it wasn't the biggest movie I've ever seen - not by any means - but the hell it cost more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw that the IMDb was an abysmal rating, I was wondering what I was going to get, but since the disk was on the player, I settled down and watched it. As other commentators have pointed out, public enemies are NOT a historical film per se - and I noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I haven't seen before), IMDb is not categorized as such. Come People! It's a STORY based on some real people - that's all! If I wanted a lesson on history, I'd sit at this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (real name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) NEVER was even accused of any crime, and as other commentators have already said, she probably never even took part in her sons' activities. They sent her to movies when they "worked"! (I hope she wasn't as critical as some of those watching this movie!) Theresa Russell has never had an easy task of portraying a woman from 17 to her. death at the age of 52 - from a young girl running from home to a hard mother of four sons hoodlum. I think she did pretty well. The cheeky smile she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I agree with some of the critics that the direction of this movie is under the steam and I sympathize with it. Theresa was to tell the director to forget about topless pictures - she did not contribute to the story. Perhaps some of the stars with a bigger name could have injected some of their own experiences to overcome the wrong direction, while the other graders were not so brave. Who knows? But even if it wasn't blocky, it was more than 2.8 !! I have all my DVDs on a personal database where I score them before looking at the IMDb score (although it sometimes affects minor changes later). I take what I get for my own merits instead of holding one movie against the others of the same genre and the one I felt was fun enough to get 6.8. (Yeah, I accept that such a practice tends to depend on my mood at the time, but then it doesn't apply to those who vote on IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I looked at the IMDb and saw how it got scary score. Given the surprise, I decided to read a few more notes in the hope of understanding low ratings, and I noticed that they were quite polarized. I agreed with those who said the film was worth watching and concluded that some people are hardly pleased. Well, because some were absolutely scary, why don't they get there and do better movies? I will look forward to the gems that must be able to develop! On the other hand, if they don't, why don't they just snatch?
