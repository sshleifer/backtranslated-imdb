The breathtaking story of two evacuees was turned into a nice little movie, the BBC. Most children who love a good story will enjoy it. The characters are very well played with a very good cast. Not sure if our American friends will appreciate it, but they will be mentioned when Aunty Lou runs with a gorgeous American soldier.
