I saw this movie about 4 times and every time I am impressed by the work of the second camera assistant. It looks trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as stated in the comments. The importance we are dealing with is now as important as it was 40 years ago. The activity is a little tense, but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar! This person has to go back to the store - maybe overhead? What is this person waiting for? I'm gonna watch and wait and cheer out of seclusion - Bob
