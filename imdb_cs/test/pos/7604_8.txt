It turned out that this film is almost what I expected. Of course it is content, of course it is predictable. We all know a fairy tale. But knowing that when you go watch, it's nice to watch. It was funny and sweet. I found it uncomfortable that it turned out that Geeks either children who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore math t-shirts. I was outcast in high school and I didn't do these things. It goes much deeper. To do with many things, some of how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness, and how willing you are to be with other children. Anyway, I won't get into it. I do not agree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing as a geek. With brackets, without makeup and unwashed hair, I don't think too many people drool over it. And even if he returns to high school and gets rid of those things. She is still wearing "bad" clothes, "bad" hair and has a "bad" attitude to be considered cool. And her other "geek" friend can be beautiful, but no matter where I come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and outside)
