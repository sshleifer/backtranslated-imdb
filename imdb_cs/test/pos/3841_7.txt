I've seen this movie only once, a few years ago. But I remember that I like it very much. Spoilers ahead ** The old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. Her servant hears it and the plot to get rid of the cats so he can be lucky. The keys to milk. When they wake up, they find themselves far away. She has to go back to her house before it's too late. With the help of an independent cat and other animal accomplices, avoiding the butler and defeating his plan. It could have been better, but it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
