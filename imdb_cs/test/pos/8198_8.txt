This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. It is interesting to see the tragic fall of the king and everything that happens around him. It reminded me a bit of "King Lear" and some other Shakespeare games. King begins with noble ambitions, unite the kingdom under one ruler and stop all quarrels so that people can prosper and lead better lives. He and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by Li Gong, devised a system in which he pretends to go into exile in a competitive kingdom to hire a killer who kills the king, giving him an excuse to go to war. But while he is gone, the king becomes sad in his desire for power and continues to kill. <br /> <br /> There are many side lands that keep the action going. There is an awning that pretends to be stupid and foppish, but which is really very clever and wants to become king himself. The father of two children with a royal mother has been keeping her secret for years. Then there is a prime minister, a political opponent with a king who turns out to be his father. The killer is a complex character himself. The Adept swordsman and the killer go through the Reformation when a royal lover comes to him. He wants nothing more with killing, but Li Gong wins him (who wouldn't be?). When he sees the cruel and cruel king become. Some magnificent cinematography, especially the battle of a scene that is being done on a large scale - as they said, thousands of people, literally. Acting is fine, nothing special. It's a story that's interesting, though for more than two and a half hours, it pushes the limit. Definitely worth seeing.
