Very great movie. Great love story. Lots of sword fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heroes and villains. Real history. Few in the West know much Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The earth is actually named after him. Some are familiar with the terra cotta army that recently appeared. This is a historical epic about how the Period of Warring States ended and the united China. He founded a dynasty that only the last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that has consistently defined Chinese civilization since then. Chin (or King Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire) was roughly contemporary with Scipio, Hannibal, and Fabius in the west. Parallel Roman world domination (Western and Eastern worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like Chin. It wouldn't be for the next century before West made Caesar — ​​the closest comparable Western figure. Chin is very sympathetic here at the beginning, but in the course of the film he develops in a reckless despot. History merely records the reckless despot part, but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for the true evolution of the character during this long film. The famous killer story is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote. Gong Li is beautiful. It's the emotional core of the story. All this makes a great movie making.
