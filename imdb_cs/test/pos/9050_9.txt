Despite being old, Inki and Minah Bird are, in my opinion, fun and charming cartoons. The work of art is not extraordinary but good enough. This cartoon doesn't have dialogues, just sounds and music, but this combination works pretty well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, fun and fun. This cartoon also makes a difference because it focuses on just 3 characters: Inki (a little black woman), Minah Bird (a very weird bird) and a hungry lion who wants to have Inki and Minah for breakfast - so chases during most cartoons. I actually find that the lion is very handsome, cheerful and cool. I really like the lion. The poor lion is so stupid and defeated that you have to apologize. For me, the real enemy is Minah Bird, not a lion. Almost a lion in one place - too bad, that he can't absorb him because he deserves it. Back to this short animated movie is not the only boring or boring moment. At least for me. The only piece I found stupid is the end because the bird has a big fight with the lion, steals teeth and puts them on. Other than that, I have nothing major to criticize about, except that the steak should definitely go for a lion and not a bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underestimated little gem, which should definitely get more credit.
