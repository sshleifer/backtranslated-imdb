This is one of those films that have never been published, and so they lacked when they originally played in theaters. When switching TV channels, I met him and was immediately involved in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose ruthlessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I often wanted to see the movie again, but I couldn't even remember his name and never saw it in the rental shops. James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles and rodeo footage was the first. While being an action movie and having a Western setting and a theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in the movies.
