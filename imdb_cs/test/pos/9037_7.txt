Look at those faces next to the prison entrance. It's not the faces of Hollywood accessories. Someone in production was really smart to shoot in Oxford, Mississippi, because you can't get that kind of authenticity from the studio backlot. Cut down the narrow, dusty roads, the frozen ground below, and the skeletal trees barely hung. No wonder these faces look hard and merciless; they only reflect the ground from which it stems. Old Man Lucas (Hernandez) is more afraid of his life, but then stems from the same hard country. The film works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentiments, and even has some tension. Old man Lucas is not very likeable. It is a sacrifice and we sympathize, but it is also haughty and hostile. The script wisely refuses to sweeten him. So we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on less sympathetic. The scenario also wisely avoids direct dealing with racism because it tends to preach and be less effective. Instead, we have shown how easily prejudices can condemn an ​​innocent person and condemn him to terrible death. So it is through our common instinct to see the righteousness that the effects of racism are revealed, a much more effective way. It also makes sheriff and lawyer actions more understandable because they are otherwise part of Jim Crowe's system. Note how the film does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that old man Lucas would like to mix with the whites anyway, and there is no indication that even lawyer Stevens (Brian) wanted to cross the color line except to see justice. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future, as the child (Jarman) symbolizes, whose head is not yet filled with "concepts". He's not exactly friends with Lucas, but he has seen the ordinary humanity that he made friends after falling into a frozen stream. The last line of the dialogue also shows that it is in place with your uncle, a lawyer, instead of his more hidebound parents (the dining table scene is important and easy to overlook). The lawyer could not join the future civil law, but the boy could. This is a real hopeful aspect of the film. During this short 3-year period, 1949–51, a number of racially motivated films appeared (The Well, No Way Out, The Home of Brave, Lost Borders). . Even the superbly separated MGM got into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, McCarthy purges in Hollywood to end the "troubled" movies that may not serve the Cold War ends. But each of them is worth catching up, not just because they're good movies, but because after 60 years and Jim Crow are still relevant.
