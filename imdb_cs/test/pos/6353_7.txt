Hummmm, ... ANOTHER Keystone comedy in the park !!! It seems that the place where the number one was filmed was in the same local park because there are a lot of Chaplin and Arbuckle movies! And even though it's still another, it's pretty different and well done that I've always enjoyed it. I think he's supposed to be a little younger, although in his mother's eyes, TOO is young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty doesn't share her feelings, and soon she and Mabel run for innocent fun. Things get complicated when mother's watches are stolen. Fat finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift ... and a lot of problems. cute and nice little movie.
