Another great performance of Tom Wilkinson is interrupting "Separate Lies", a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning, where husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy. An accident near their house at night, having a party, brings the police to the neighborhood. This is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes a neighbor suspect, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did and promises to go to the police the next day. When James comes home, Ann is upset that he's making such a big deal and says he's driving a car. Of course, James is not so eager to rush to the police. He suggests calling Bule and telling him his decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's just it," Ann says. "I'm f___ing Bule." James's devastation is just the beginning of this well-developed drama. It's a good example of how sex change is changing the story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into the lake and her children drown. He gets life in jail. What if my father did it? Chair. You would be surprised how often the result will be different. The same is true here - if it was James who would have an affair and do the following, viewers might feel different about the story. If Ann was at James's place, it would be appalling. How it is, it's extremely sad. Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blind to the woman he adores, and Emily Watson does a beautiful job like Ann, who, once free of lies - her participation in an accident and a happy marriage - knows what she has do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - unobtrusive, ascending and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings and no one is good or bad. There Are Separate Lies - James, that his marriage is happy, Ann is as above - and there is one unifying lie - an accident that all the participants are silent about. It's enough for Ann, who Maggie knows. In the end, they all have to deal with the individual lies revealed by each lie. Brilliant film.
