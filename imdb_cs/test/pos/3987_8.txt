This modest comedy with a heavy bitterweet subtitle that contains Billy's famous humor is a great departure, pleasantly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This film has a variety of tears-jerker, dramatic, serious basic themes (especially with the scene with Steven Seagal). This film was both fun and serious, a film about lost love, relationships with father-son, wife, friendship and values ​​with a good deal of humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always preserved as in the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this film remain firm. The discovery of a talented talent agent Billy Crystal in a giant man in Romania reveals and a remarkable look at the film agent behind the scene is fascinating. Yet, attention is focused on sensitive bonds of love and learning about oneself. Eight out of ten stars.
