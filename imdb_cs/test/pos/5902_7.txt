This is not the best Canadian movie ever, IMO. I won't get off the track and names 3 or 4 better. Just a few nights before I saw a "thief on a bike", a highly rated Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers filmed their film at a particular time and place, with minimal set and casting resources. The result in both cases is fascinating and the joy of watching the realistic environment and characters themselves. Long-lasting shots on the faces and the landscape make it almost in itself. As has been said, this is not entirely in the same league as the Italian classics. The film is shot in the freezing, barren city of Quebec. This frigidity contrasts with the warmth of people and the eyes of director Claude Jutra. Basically what you get is a series of medallions that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not ha, ha funny - but engaging, and probably sometimes difficult at the time, but now heated with patin nostalgia. The film curls; There is little voltage. Somewhere about half to two-thirds through the story begins. All you met here are involved, and you know these characters well; so at the beginning a little patience. The story is good; it leaves you thinking and includes sex, love and death, all the essential elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all these things, you won't be disappointed.
