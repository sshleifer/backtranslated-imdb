"Committed" is all about Graham as an irrefutable optimist who goes looking for his self-confident husband who was looking for himself, all leading to some kind of kookie, an optimistic comedy odyssey that includes a lot of side characters and problems. A fresh, fun and unpredictable little fluctuation that "Committed" lacks in a story that creates good character and subtle morals and maxims. If you like this little chick movie, which has received slightly above average reviews by critics and the public, you may want to check out Lisa Krueger hit India "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
