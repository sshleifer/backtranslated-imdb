All reviewers make one big mistake. This film is not supposed to be taken seriously. It was made for children and youth in the late 1980s or early 90s, and as such it was really a movie of time. If you hated this period, or you love the first movie so much that you can't even joke about it, then it's a waste, but just because it's not meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of the commander of 1 beast at the box office (grossed to four miles. With nine miles of Budget) were probably the reason for abandoning the seriousness of the original and bringing it to the present day. You can complain about story, dialogue or logic, but again it was done, not to win races. If the film tried to take it seriously, it would be a total failure, but it won't do that for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees the movie theater advertised by The Beastmaster 2, enough). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry's films: This film knows its limitations. It is rather a comedy / parody than a usual adventure. The soundtrack was also great. The actors do not take it so seriously, so even the usually irritating role of "spoiled rich brat" (playing here very well by the young Kari Wuhrer) turns out well. So, if you are nostalgic for the 80's and 90's (cheese) culture, or you liked the first part, and you don't mind going out on a cheese limb, you'll have a lot of fun with this attempt to revive Dar in the 1990s (literary). This isn't really a continuation of the first, and don't look at it if you want it. It's more like a fantastic sequel to "what if". As for the question of "why another dimension and not just a different time": When in history we had those high winged humanoid beings that suck the flash of bone (from the end of Part 1)? By the way, the film ends in the Zoo because of an attempt to make a cheap big money. It is believed to be the best place for Dar to show all his movements (it's an animal manipulator).
