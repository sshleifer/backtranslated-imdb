Previous commentators have noticed a similarity in appearance between this film and the Third Man, a classic film by Caroly Reed, who plays Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity hits the viewer almost immediately. It is a really high praise that we can compare to Robert Kraker's cinematography in The Third Man. The stolen identity story was also defined quite precisely, but rather in common terms. I found it very creative and fun. As common as "mistaken - or stolen - identity" devices is in theater and cinema, it is only a device and not being mistaken for conspiracy, itself. As a result, while the viewer saw this device "a thousand times", the Stolen Identity plot is full of surprises and twists based on this device. It is an unexpected turnaround that makes this film much fresher, more original and witty than a conspiracy could convey. The stolen identity does not rely on the tension that characterizes most of the film noire because there is no real mystery. Instead, he relies on a constant, less surprise. In short, the Mistaken Identity is rather common; but this story is not. Finally, although I was not familiar with the cast, I found that the negotiations are uniformly good, sometimes excellent. Perhaps I could have imagined that other actors would turn this film into melodrama, with bombast, huge gestures, and obvious facial expressions. Negotiations are always more limited and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly reticent and trustworthy, never "blowing his envelope" with an obvious facial expression, because we see too often in films that are dependent on underlining to maintain dramatic tension. The only disappointment of this otherwise subtle film was the very weak development of the subculture of the love story. As it looks, it seems to be a follow-up idea - a slight surprise, in fact - to the end. Or perhaps during their joint suffering, the actors simply could not convey the tangible level of chemistry I could appreciate. This sub-plot should be clearer when the story unfolds. All in all, I thought this movie was a great little gem, and I wondered why I hadn't seen it before. Try it, you'll like it.
