Haggard is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. It features a cast from CKY (Movies) and also has a great soundtrack. If you've seen any CKY or Viva La Bam, you'll notice that everyone (of the two) is in it. Including parents Bam and many other people. The story is about a girlfriend Ryan Dunn Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) who cheats on him and tries to come back. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) destroy her house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> Great music on the soundtrack. Bands like Him & Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and Stooges pop and new order. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Viva La Bam or CKY (movies), I doubt you like it. If you like it ... this movie is great.
