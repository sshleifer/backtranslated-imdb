Why couldn't the end of the film be Sean Connery's men fighting France instead of Germans. Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, tribes from Morocco and Algeria had raided French military and civilian settlements. This film could be consecutive of that historical aspect where the French seized Rasuadli so his followers would not attack Algeria, and then his followers would attack the French to free him. The film is still stereotyped for shootings between Germans and Americans. When Americans fire German, their weapons (even pistols) emit loud noises, create large bloody wounds, and their enemies shout after the shot. When the Germans are firing at the Americans, their weapons do not produce large sounds, they do not produce bloody wounds, and their enemies emit little or no sound after the shot. In real life, the American Krag Rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produced until the early M-16 appeared. Krag was hard to keep, not reliable, and the rifle was always distracting. The German Mauser was one of the world's best rifles. We were so impressed that during the Spanish American War, we made a copy and called it the Springfield Rifle. Finally, the people of Morocco must have the word for artillery because the French used their raids against Morocco. I didn't like it when Rasuldai felt stupid that there was no word for artillery in the artillery dictionary. Instead, Rasuadli said that Europeans had guns on wheels that make ground vibration.
