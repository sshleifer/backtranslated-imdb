Exclusively for Coop lovers, though Clint Eastwood is a very strong, though inconspicuous presence is a great asset to this very good documentary. It's a biography of Gary Cooper, based primarily on his filmography, but also on private archives that show him as a young man as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.) as an older man, eventually ill and close person. After the "end" I didn't feel that I knew the man much better. However, I spent a very good moment looking back at the many best moments of his films; and my respect for a very talented actor and a great professional has increased tenfold. The film shows what is most interesting how Cooper's career can be paralleled with the development of American society before and after World War II. Two big moments are the time when Cooper has to answer justice for communism in the film world; and when James Stewart (very brilliant too) received a Cooper Award a month before his death. I'm not crying, but ... that was tight! Watch if you can: it's so much worth it. ... If you love Cooper, that is. Or older America ...
