Murder over New York is one of Chan's better mysteries and I just saw it for the first time. In this, Charlie Chan visits New York to attend a police conference. At the same time, people who deal with aircraft plants are murdered and decided to help investigate, along with their son number 2. These murders have proved to be sabotage in aircraft and Chan helps identify the killer ... <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan plays well Sidney Toler and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as his son number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I liked the mystery and it is worth having, if you like it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
