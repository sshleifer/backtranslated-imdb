After five years in jail, Tony Le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and Italian Mario Ferratim (Robert Manuel) and invites Tony to steal some of the jewelry from the famous jewelry shop window. But Mappin & Webb Ltd is falling. Tony finds her former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the nightclub owner L 'Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset) and he humiliates her, beats her back and takes jewelry. Then she calls Jo and Mario and suggests breaking into the safety of jewelry. They invited the Italian safes specialist and elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and create a perfect robbery. They are successful in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things wrong by giving a valuable ring to his lover. "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a wonderful film-noir, surely I have seen the best. The scenario is credible, backed by the amazing direction of Jules Dassin, the stunning performance of cast and great cinematography. Jean Servais has an outstanding performance as a criminal with the principles of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of robbery is amazing and extremely tense and certainly belongs to the best in the history of cinemas. I present this great movie in my favorite movie list at all. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Rififi"
