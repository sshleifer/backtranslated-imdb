I would like to say that I loved Campfire Tales! For me, it was one of the original twisted-up horror swings. As if the content of the movie wasn't frightening or quite strange, you're over. It's a very amazing movie and I'm so happy to be released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to make a copy on that day. because all these other movies came out shortly afterwards and were recognized, but if it weren't for my brother to tell me about the movie, I wouldn't know. Which stinks, because in my opinion it's much better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer", or any other horror for that time. So I hope you can watch the movie yourself and at least you will see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror junkie, Campfire Tales was like a dessert for me!
