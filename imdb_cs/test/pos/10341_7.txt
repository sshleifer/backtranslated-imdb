This film is still alive and kicking today thanks to Alan Ladd's presence. This is good in one direction, because the film has some interesting things, but in another it is bad because everyone who watches expects that the tough guy Ladd is going to bypass his usual steps, he will be mighty disappointed. Without fanfare or performance, Ladd is suddenly introduced in the Third War. True, his role is crucial, but he is small and likely to be lost in random order. In the ambivalent scenario of former journalist Martin Mooney, there are many key roles that have hit all the political alliances and totally recklessly denigrate reform candidates. She is a beautiful and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who combines the various elements of a wide story together. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually continues a series of jumps, much like the movies later turned out by the French "New Wave", though easier to follow here, especially if you're aware that the movie's original title was Paper Bullets. . However, some of the film's narrative and character switches are a little worrying, especially in the role played by Jack LaRue, who wisely chose to act in a strangely non-binding manner. One of Jack's best games, but no one will notice it!
