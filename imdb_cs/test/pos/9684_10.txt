I like everything about a family boy. My favorite characters in the family include Brian and Stewie, and I love episodes that are mainly about games like "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2). very good. The comments they make just have me. Peter's behavior is also very funny because some of the things he does are so great that they are retarded. Voice-playing is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, who provides voices for half the Griffin family and their perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire, and how he manages this range (especially with singing). He deserves his two Emmy for giving the voice of the evil genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and utterly insane regular character Mayor Quahog. What I like about Chris (expressed by Seth Green) is what he says shows that he comes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. UK Fox has decided to change the season to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program itself, but rather marketing. <br /> <br /> If you like Family Guy, then I would recommend Seth MacFarlane another American American project. Dad who uses a different style of humor but is still very cheerful.
