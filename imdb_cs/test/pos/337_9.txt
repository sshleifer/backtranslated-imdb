Finally, I snorted a copy of Kannathila Muthamittala on Netflix and spent the new Yerin Eve watching an amazing drama. It started with the fact that Shyama (the amazing Nandita Das) married Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then their war took over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp when she gives birth to a child. A few years later, we see Amudha, a playful sweet child (P. S. Keerthan), who is a pet (or a burden) of teachers, parents and classmates in a very similar problem to Maria. On her birthday, her parents told her Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she was not their biological child, she was accepted. This leans her confident world filled with love, and she constantly dwells on why her mother left her. Several attempts at truancy later adoptive parents will take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her mother. The earth is torn by the raging civil war, and the trio is inevitably caught up in disorder. But this also leads to their meeting with the new Shyama - the one who is finally confronted with Amudha and asked why she left her daughter. The story of a child who has to deal with being abandoned at birth with her obsessive effort to reunite with her mother of birth, the unconditional love of adoptive parents, the demons that drive mother of birth, the normality of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterpiece that blended many ingredients into a saga that is mixing souls. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and charming moments in the film. The film has excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandity Das, Simran and the absolute stunning role of Amudha - abandoned - by the child artist P. S. Keerthan. This performance won the National Prize. <br /> <br /> The camera is a visual poetry - every shot is a beautifully created and breathtaking shot. I am fascinated by the connection of Mani Ratnam to terrorism, love and obsession. I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely excellent. Mahadevan's character was absolutely unique - his passion and idealism did not cause him selfish, but rather well-cared for how much he cared for the little girl. His one liner was cheerful. Simran's mother was also quite multidimensional - she was idealistic, loved an adopted daughter, but was also worried about her biological children. The shock, anxiety, and obsession of Amudha's child was exceptionally portrayed by P. S. Keerthan. Wide accusing eyes enjoyed her most. In fact, Nandita Das and her husband were mysterious characters. Mani may have deliberately made them mysterious not to give us obvious ideas as to why they were the way they were - a mystery why a terrorist becomes what it becomes. It also prevented him from being judicious - it was another conflict in which he did not take any parties, but only reported when he showed human tragedy. Kannathil Muthamittal is a visual poetry and a drama that touches the soul - I rarely cry movies, but this left me wet eyes and a little heart. It's a beautiful movie - treasure and breeder, if you can find a copy; please today borrow or steal and watch a movie!
