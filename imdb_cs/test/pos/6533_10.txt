I have to say that this film was probably the funniest movie I saw all year. And that doesn't mean it would be good. This is probably the most aesthetic movie I've ever seen, yet it's so cheerful. you can say that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately they don't do such a good job for them, so it's also the lines delivered in what should be a serious tone, they sound really funny. Basically, Aaron Carter plays a character that is very similar to a character in real life, yet he can make the character seem sinister and not realistic at all. This movie is one of those movies where everything that sounds serious is going to be really funny and all the things to be funny are just so stupid and crazy that you have to laugh because you know how hard it is. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. Certainly I would recommend it if your mood for a good laugh.
