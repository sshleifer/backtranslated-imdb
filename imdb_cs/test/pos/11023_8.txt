Wow! I caught it on IFC recently after I watched it but Im Cheerleader. Id never heard of this movie, but the description sounded remotely interesting. I went with low expectations and now I must say that this is one of the best love stories in the movie. Robin Tunney has a great job of showing a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and only the smallest detail in the film is just right and credible. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this movie really touched me. I recommend this movie to anyone who has a vision ability.
