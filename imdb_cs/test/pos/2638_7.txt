Wildlife has an obvious resemblance to the _Fast Times in Ridgemont High_ and Wild Wild__ comes short. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Some others tent wrote a comment above. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the 80th flica quintessential. However, Wild Life is pleasant if you're not stupid about mindless movies are mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). Little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he is straight rude ("I have a Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge!") The colonel also makes an appearance ("trial ..."). RIP Colonel 1931-1997. This film is no worse than 6 compared to other genres, btw. This is no worse than 7 in terms of the next 80 years of teen comedy on it. It has a very good feeling from Cameron Crowe. Only staniels gave it 5.
