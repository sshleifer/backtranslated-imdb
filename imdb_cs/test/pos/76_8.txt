I suppose I like the movie as much as anyone I know; This is not perfect, but under the name "The Americanization of Lily," this charming and unforgettable semi-musical satire may propose to be more appreciated, and still loved by those who have recognized his peculiar spirit of subtlety, clever reason, created by Blake Edwards. humor and solid story. An unlikely but stunning story follows Lili Smith, a spy spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black and white war; Lili Schmidt as Smith helps her uncle, who is also patriotic, for Germany, but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic. Its goal is William Larrabee, the charismatic leader of the American squadron, who can provide her with valuable information. The story thickens when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, opens her eyes to the effects of playing her spy and sees the effects of fighting on the wounded men in the hospital and realizes what that might mean to his men she met. He is jealous of his opponent's Larrabee's affection, then realizes that he can no longer do what he is doing and gives up the espionage. The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI ended, as she sings the thematic song of the film, "Wish" in a darkened theater, one after one of the members of Larrabee's squadron appears, including her lover himself, showing them forgiven her and their former adversaries; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins the singing "It's a long way to tipperraree". This is a daring and sometimes brilliant idea written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of John Goldfar; and it's a wonderful story. Larrabee is a squadron, including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other loving types populating this live movie; and the feeling of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic, both in its scope and in its realization. Credits must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets, Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate music scores, and for Russell Harlan for his vibrant cinematography. In beautiful shots, the main actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp excellent as Uncle Lili's Kurt, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as inebriate pilot, Gloria Gloria Paul as Lili's stripteasing rival, and many other great actors in smaller parts. It's hard to say enough nice things about the tempo or the cleverness of this righteous side of the broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to omit the horrors of a real struggle, for example, an almost comical opera approach with which people have made war in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization. This comedy also helps to pave the way for Lili's conversion from the uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to accept the reality of what it does and potentially what it can cause. It is a rare film "the meaning of life" about Lili's "Americanization", its promotion in the real world and then, among other things, the tragedy. It's scary, in many ways it's beautiful and beautiful. I consider this to be a master director of Blake Edwards. and under the title "The Americanization of Lili", I believe that almost no changes that could be recognized as a polished sapphire film are what I know.
