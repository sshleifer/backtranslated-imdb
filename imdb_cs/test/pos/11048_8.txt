This film is worth it, despite what you can hear. Marie Dressler's performance (I hope I tell the truth) as a drunken old sot is a reason to see this film. It's amazing performance. In three scenes, he is stiffly drunk in return, and twice as long. In fact, you can feel alcohol when it's done. Amazing. And of course Greta speaks with her first lines about the film and is great. Eugen O'Neill's story is solid and like most O'Neill stories, very deep and intense. This is not easy fun, but if you appreciate the great characters of actors from the 30s and 40s you will enjoy it. Some film is technically unclear, but it's all worth it.
