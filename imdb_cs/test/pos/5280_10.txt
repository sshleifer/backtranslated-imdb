Obviously, Ponyo can only be seen as another stupid animated film that the studio could release to survive. It's far from it, and it can be easily described as a captivating, beautiful movie experience. Miyazaki really has another masterpiece. Now, to many, this has been said to be at least his achievements in filming-making, due to in his part "a certain strange factor" not being there. This is true - the morals and insights that are not so obvious in his previous films are in the back of this picture. Ponyo is not too hard to understand or understand. I think his idea was to make the children's film as suitable for adults as their children, and not to be too complicated. It has perfectly accomplished and has not lost any substance on the way, which is why it gets 10. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film itself is so stunning from the beginning and the way its presentation is so beautiful sometimes left me in astonishment because I remembered how they were all hand-drawn by Miyazaki himself. I wasn't so enlightened and happy when I saw the movie since I saw him come back once in a while (another movie you shouldn't miss). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; Even the music was pure perfection for her. The only bad thing I have to say was English dubbing. Don't get me wrong, they were also good, but I saw Ponya about 2 weeks before it came out at national level, and I believed that in some parts I would like some of his Japanese dialogues to stay (not all, though , enjoyed the "English Way" too). Everyone should see Ponyo; it is absolutely flawless and in another film production league. Finally, and don't hold me to it, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ponyo got the nomination for Best Picture because it is now 10 movies that can be nominated for it. It's just so good.
