UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly fun. While the plot triggers too many directions, making a long-time movie, it can never be charmed and cleansed. Several conspiracies, one warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, provide plenty of smile, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. It shouldn't all work and sometimes it will hit, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit down and have fun. It's charmer!
