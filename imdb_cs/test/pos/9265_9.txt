I became a fan of the TV series "Killing: Living on the Street" late during the series, but very quickly became a fan. It was a police show, unlike others: visually different in the use of hand-held cameras, everywhere with viewers, with multi-ethnic and mutation casts and their diverse and fascinating personalities, and that it covered everything good and bad. police departments, including corruption and personality clashes that appear on the surface. Murder: A film that follows the series is as good as a movie made for television. After being shot Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now the mayor of Baltimore, members of the series are back to help find the killer. In addition, cast members who have left power and those who have died will also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the return series, and the bristle scenario with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, an amazing TV movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
