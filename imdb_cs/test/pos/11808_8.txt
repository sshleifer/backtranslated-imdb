High and high school teachers will find "The Cure" as an excellent teaching tool, as a companion to "Huckleberry Finn" or as a separate lesson. Though AIDS is to be a major theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love as developed between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers. Especially effective are the calls for writing focused on the symbolism of tennis shoes. I also suggest a controlled discussion of how Eric is evolving from a manipulative user to a loving friend.
