To this day, there is no movie I have seen more than The Chipmunk Adventure, nor has any movie brought me much happiness. It is by no means the biggest movie or the greatest animated film, but the 1988 eight-year-old was the most amazing, funniest and most exciting movie ever! I am equally impressed today with music numbers, each of which is a unique song with beautifully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of the 1980s (I think Pat Benetar on helium, just smarter). The controversy was outraged at the apparently suggestive tone of Chipette's "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which seemed to me a lot more innocent at the time. But when I look at it as a rational adult, I can fully understand the concerns; You have three young girls in modest harem clothes, passionately proclaiming "happiness" what it is about. Chipettes were definitely tenfold for this film. But this controversial problem is not so close to alternating Chipmunk's otherwise wonderful adventure animation, encouraging parents and adult adult children to check this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early 1990s like me. :-)
