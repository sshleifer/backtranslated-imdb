Super original. Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller on the screen really go along so well. I hope it comes soon. I saw this film for the first time at a screening. Because of my age and sex, I was asked to stay on "conversation." We all have to comment on the film and many people did not like it. I really liked it and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was good. Go when it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go ahead and know nothing about it. I didn't know anything when I went to the show than it was, it was said, "Camile." It's really worth seeing.
