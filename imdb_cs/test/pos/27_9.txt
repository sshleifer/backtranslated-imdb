Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are great as Sir and his Dresser. Of course, the game is great and nothing can be compared to the theater's immediacy and collegiality, and I think you're listening better in theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are "up-close" more than we are in the theater, we are witnessing subtle changes in expression, "seeing" better and listening. Both the game and the film are amazing: moving, intelligent, illuminating - from behind-the-scenes story of society, historical context, two main characters and parallel characters in "Lear" itself. If you can't see it in the theater (I don't think it would be a lot these days), then please do a favor and get a video.
