This is James Cagney's first movie I've ever seen. I was never interested in his films because I thought I wouldn't like anything in this movie theater and because I heard most of Cagney's movies are the same. I have to say I liked it. According to today's film standards, it wasn't strange, but I found it surprisingly fun. Cagney didn't look like a tough guy, but he played the role very well.
