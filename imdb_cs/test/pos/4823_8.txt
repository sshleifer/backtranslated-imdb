I honestly found Wicked Little Things to be a very cool and funny horror movie. My friend gave it to me, and I really saw it as nothing but a miserable low budget horror movie. very cool and very good and while I say it looked a bit unnecessary at times and when it may not be the best horror movie still good. I thought acting was very good, especially from the girl who plays the mother (it seemed that very believable and very sympathetic to me) .And while it's a little clich√© and over the top of its good.Overall i have to say if afterdark horror fest movies aren't your style, then you shouldn't have any business watching this but if you like horror movies or a bad time before you check out Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
