Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest movie I've seen, and it's also the first silent movie I've seen. I've heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I pulled the tape out at home and watched it. When it ended, I thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. You don't think so, but some of them were sad and disgusting. Sad that the mother dies and the stroller rolls down the staircase and the disgusting creature has to eat spoiled meat with worms in it. Today it is still considered one of the best silent and Russian movies ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they find it.) You'll be surprised at how good it is now. It must be a classic. 5/5.
