I highly recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I read the book first and then saw the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion), the movie was still great. My son and I agree that even though we like the best version of the book, we liked the ending of the film better than the book ends. The scenery is just huge and the soundtrack must have. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and provides music is an added plus. Luke Wilson does a decent job as Officer Delin and is pretty much what I thought Delinko would look like when I read the book. I'm surprised that it was no better in theaters and I would wait for the DVD to come out.
