I loved it. Others have uncovered spoilers, but I don't. It was an unusual assumption, actually something special, but I went with him completely. Camille was a difficult task to get convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills allowed her to get closer to the part - without being muggling or ridiculous. I don't know why she was interested in a loser like James Franco, but she married him anyway. I like him as an actor and also thought he did a great job. What is not to be ashamed of. There were movies with similar settings, such as "Ghost". I just love Sienna Miller and I went along with the situation as written in the script. I feel that her great acting talent is extremely underestimated, and I hope the public will recognize him more. I thought all the actors played their games very well and hope that more people will see the movie. I warmly recommend. I was surprised that my local Block Buster had about 10 copies. I'll definitely buy it.
