I am amazed that I have a real affection for this because I am not a lover of action and adventure. But hey ... It's hard to go with Robert Carlyle. I read a few bad or mild reviews on this movie, pulling them apart for a period of error or improbable plot development, but no one seems to mention a rather interesting transition of character that is characterized by how stiff, down-to-his-luck robber ( Carlyle is transformed into a somewhat noble, unselfish hero, and as a handsome boy, a cowardly wanderer (Miller) develops a real appetite for life on the highway once he "gets the impression of it". Plunkett & Macleane is filled with a lot of bad humor, opulent scenes (especially using the "fireworks" of former apothacary Plunkett) and a gracefully eclectic musical score. Certainly worth seeing for CLIMAX SCENE! Shoot it, boys!
