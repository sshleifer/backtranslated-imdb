Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye with this film, mainly thanks to Bogosian's electrifying performance on the screen and the biting, brilliant scenario. Every moment bursts with ever-increasing tension that culminates in a truly unforgettable movie experience. If there was a hint of the writer and the director's ability to divide the two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless connection of creativity, then it is it! The result is a powerful performance that is now being implemented on time, perhaps because of the disturbing fascination of our celebrity culture, and it is a distorted interpretation of fame. The final accusation of the growing morbidity of our society and the suicidal hunger for further great excitement. <br /> <br /> A movie that can't be forgotten. I highly recommend all those interested in the darker side of human nature.
