I will not lie. To say that this movie is confusing, it's like saying that the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen previous films by Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know that means something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. About half of the audience has already gone to the movie an hour ago. By the end, there were only 15 people who wondered what they saw in hell. For one I could only understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even this can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because for one, we get some spectacular performance (Marsden's Big and Langella come back as a familiar haunted character), and most importantly, two because it's totally original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to to tell a story that dares to be different. Frankly, it's ONLY ONE way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be narrated as intended. Finally, if you don't want to spend some serious thought in smart movie (and then all this can mean nothing), stay FAR from this. But if you want to look at the profound, rich, complex and provocative part of spirituality, existentialism and the predictability of human nature, look at this. Be prepared for lengthy discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If you accidentally read this review, took my recommendation, saw the movie and still believe you have spent 2 hours your life unnecessarily, I would like to share my views on the whole meaning and action film. See, that's why I liked it very much - supports the discussion! As hard as it may be, I will try to summarize this by paraphrasing the somewhat depressed quotation of Langell's character, which explains the importance of a simple box for employees: "Your house is the box in which you live. You went to work, is a box, on wheels When you get home from work, sit in front of a box of moving images, watch the mind and soul rot and the box that is your body gets worse when you are finally placed in the final box. .. relax under the ground and the ground.
