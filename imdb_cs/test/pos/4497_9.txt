I did not read the novel from which the film is based. So I can't comment on what's missing or if changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, I had an amazing experience watching KITE RUNNER. . The actors in this film are from Afghanistan and other countries in the area. There are 3 young children in this close epic movie there first role, They were amazing. The scenes that were reportedly in Kabul were shot in different parts of China, I suppose the area is similar to Real Places in the book. Mark Foster directed and found that NEDRRLAND had created the same spell. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are the first. /> <br /> I found a better film than those who were nominated and won the Oscars. The film is a subtitle, it is very readable. It has the correct rating of PG-13. SPOILER ALERT --- Baby rape scene is very well processed. But I can't give this 4 stars as a general story and a story we've seen many times many times. Less is a very valuable movie you can watch .. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 (of 4) 95 points (of 100) IMDb 9 (of 10)
