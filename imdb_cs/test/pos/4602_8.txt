There is no other word for it ... Fox fired it, with no marketing of any kind. No one in the country, except those who have been looking forward to this film, know nothing about it. All red flags flew. It must be a mess, can't be anywhere near as well as an office space, is it? Poorly. Although Office Space is not, this movie definitely has a satirical bite and a joke. It is a failure of ignition at certain levels, but who is to blame is left to the secret. Based on what is currently shown in theaters, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes laugh-loud funny. It's effective, sometimes brilliant. What is not what I can say is done. We'll see something that comes out of this movie again, whether it's a cut or reshooty. It may be merry. Sometimes it's crazy. When I left the theater, I looked around the mall, surrounded by advertisements and billboards, business and stupidity. It's not as damn dystopia as it was in 1984, but this film is ruining the ugly future of our culture. And it doesn't seem like anyone can do that. By the way, look if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried.
