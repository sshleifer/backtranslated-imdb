So I summarized it! There were others who said Naked Gun would meet James Bond. I think mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral at this point ... o) <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of past explosion. It reminds you of old movies (from the 50s and 60s) and it's not just because it plays in this time period (1955 to be exact, except Flashback), but it's the mood in which the movie is made. shows on the screen! The main actor here (who, as I said in my native France, is very popular) is perfect in his role. It's a spy with the number 117 attached. There is one character who sums it up in the movie when he asks if he's good or not ... you'll see when you watch a movie! Very funny it's really, and if you like your spies mixed with an old school taste comedy, but it doesn't take on its own or anything else it comes seriously before you need to watch! :O)
