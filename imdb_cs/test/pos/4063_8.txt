"Showtime" is somewhere north of what some critics said, and a little south of what I expected a few months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro who were comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As a "real life" crime or cops go-- and conspiracy for that matter - it's pretty illogical, but DUH --- that's comedy. Also, while special effects, chase, aerial photos and skyscrapers were blown up, but a lower key than the Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tedious and overdone. 9/11 sensitivity aside, for yourself, all the pyro-techno hyper-effect things were old enough in the last few years. It looked like a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. I hope the smaller amount in "Showtime" is an indicator of the trend in Hollywood. A downward trend, less using a stupid, less exploiting exploding building. Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their on-screen presence and charisma - and even the depth of their characters - have been "the joy of seeing" for many years. We cannot refuse this here - they are engaged actors and entertaining and attractive in this film. I can't give it a finger, but maybe explosions, excessive FX, and it all diminished the final product ??? Perhaps or maybe it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives a person the feeling that the film has not reached its highest potential. Whatever it was, "Showtime" was fun ... I guess I'll buy the DVD when it comes out - but I had the atmosphere that it wasn't all that could be. At least not everything I hoped for. Very good movie, but not a great movie. I gave him 8 out of 10.
