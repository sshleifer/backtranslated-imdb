I'll make it short and sweet. No wonder you didn't have any benefit for this movie. This is a story about the strength, beauty and possibilities that are part of meaningful education. Based on your pathetically composed comments, I see that your own education has been woefully neglected ... or worse ... completely useless. Your comments are comments of a truly ignorant person. I'd like to advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case, I feel like it's too late. I hope you do not want to go to the teaching profession yourself (especially in film studios) because you could only harm it. Oh ... last piece of advice. If you plan to write more reviews in the future, you should really correct your work. It'll take people more seriously.
