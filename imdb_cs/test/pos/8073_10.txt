For those who appreciate the silent cinema junction and social commentary, it's a unique film. A tribute to German Expressionism, partly an allegory, the film is full of visual symbolism and artistic style that destroys rivals anything seen since the 1920s. In addition, attention to the details of the period and the visual composition of the scenes as a tool for advancing the story is overwhelming. In addition, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its influence on social voice, perception and opinion. In fact, it is not so much the silence that penetrates the film because it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and the expression of the idea that inevitably follows. In short, this film is something that is not often seen, and as the film producer said in the Q&A that followed, he will let you think about its importance well into the next day.
