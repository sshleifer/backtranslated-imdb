If you like his show, you may be a little disappointed. This movie has some very funny moments and laughs are pretty constant, but none of them is very unforgettable or as fun as the stuff at the show. The initial sequence is really stupid and funny and a great start. Yes! borat makes a portrait look. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan, watch it! if you don't know it or don't like it, don't bother. 6.5 / 10
