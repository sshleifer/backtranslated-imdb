GUTS OF BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor GUTS OF VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a continuation in the sense that it has nothing to do with the first installment, I found that BEAUTY is a bit stronger and better than VIRGIN ... but then again, it's not much to say too much. BEAUTY begins as a pretty rough and straight-faced exploit movie. A couple of Yakuza cats hold a jailed young woman and start cruelly torturing her. When this ugliness happens, the guy tells the girl that they have done the same to their sister and sold her to slavery in Africa, and that they will do the same to her. Then he shoots her with some drugs and rapes her even more. Somehow he gets away and ends up in the clinic where the nurse listens to her sob. Violence breaks out of stress from its previous experience and commits suicide. A clinic worker relocated by the story of a young lady decides to avenge the gang by seducing one of the lower boys and trying to hypnotize him to kill him with the Yakuza leaders. The whole plan is turning, so now Mrs. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is subjected to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (followed by a pretty rough blunt rape along with preliminary gang rape ...). She, too, is dazed, but the cure has a special side effect on our seemingly unfortunate victim ----- transforms her into a furious hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON !!! (without sh! t, that's what's really happening !!!) That's when BEAUTY really takes off with some pretty f! cking crazy killing scenes - including a very neat chest-burst rape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and bad porn, and my favorite - killing a head-engulfed demon-vagina (complete with a vagina-slime demon) that must be seen to be Believed ... <br /> <br /> Certainly promising things are happening in GUTS OF BEAUTY, but still a very discontinuous feeling. BEAUTY almost feels like two different movies that are incompatible. But I have to give the film credit - rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and killing scenes are absolutely out of the wall. Fixed 7/10 for another crazy J-horror "classic".
