Okay, so this show will go the way "here we go again!" Week of the week, the character of David Morse helps his ride, which is in a little cucumber - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest actors in the world, and certainly the best, and have him in the series created by David Koepp - the great writer - is heaven !! Due to the lack of Love for this many show, I don't see it going to the season season - but you never know? The amount of garbage that has overcome me will excite me - hopefully something good can do for the first series !!!
