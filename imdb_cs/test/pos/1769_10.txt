Pavarotti and the cast are excellent in this beautifully shot opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's best composer of operas. Coloratura soprano is especially spectacular with its perfect playground. The title role is well enacted and well sung. The whole production is as perfect as expected. A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
