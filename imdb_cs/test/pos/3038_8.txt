This movie is a piece of the time it was created ... Realistic. The films were not candy coated during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Producers did not try to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy ending in the viewer would provoke a stir that would hopefully prompt them to action. At least it looked like it. In today's film world, this film is unlikely to be done. Certainly this end would not be, though realistic. The sad fact is that the film depicted a situation that could not have been improved without negotiating to improve the relationship between white southern traditional thinking and the progressive movements of that time.
