North and South are miniseries from the "golden age" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was the time for long, extensive epics with high production values ​​and lots of stellar portraits. This is largely excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer a less soapy opera as the elements of the story and an overall sense of history. James Read and Patrick Swayze bring an excellent performance - especially reading, which George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor in the often melodramatic storyline. The series also features cutting-edge work from Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. Costumes, filming, sets and music are also top-notch. Don't take it as a lesson of history, but take it for what it is - a well done, extensive epic of the past. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would advise viewers to skip Book 3, which was 8 years after Book 2 and was not as good as the first two. Books 1 and 2, however, are classics, even with their soap elements and worth watching.
