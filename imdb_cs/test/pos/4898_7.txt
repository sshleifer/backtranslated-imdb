There are two ways to turn a TV series into a movie. The first, most common and least successful is basically to create a long-time television episode - to see the Steptoe & Son disaster movie. The other option is to do something else - something else, Monty Python. Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series went to the second option and came up with something unique. , smart and witty - couldn't feel less like a TV episode. Try to get your head around this - writers, acting alone, are confronted with their Royston Vasey alter-egos, played, of course, they, and said to continue writing the series, otherwise the apocalypse will turn in the village. <br /> <br /> High-concept, resourceful and easy to screw? Yes, but somehow they managed to pull it out. Perhaps not for every taste, and the end stretches, but fans will be delighted, and it can even win over the uninitiated.
