I admit that I have never seen "Waiting for Guffman", in 1997 a critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town that is the stage of the theater. When the Best in Show ad had the slogan "From the team that awaited you to Guffman," a large number of critics in their reviews suggested that only people who are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time to see this movie. For shame, criticism, shame for two times! Any critic who suggests something like this with any movie probably doesn't want to share film wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one movie that I hope people will experience, now its video / dvd. "Best in Show" is undoubtedly the best comedy of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a mock-documentary style that represents the main competitors (not to mention the screwdrivers) of the annual Mayflower "Best In". Show "competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog." We have a nice and cocky Harry Pepper (guest) with his bloody greyhound, a simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with his terriors, Hamilton's Hamilton Case & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins and McKean), and airheaded millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with her coach Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their opinion on one simple object: a blue ribbon that will be given to the best dog. And ... do I have to tell you the rest? Director / Writer / Star Guest's idea of ​​humor is the one that assures me that there are comedies that are worth laughing at and that the idiots of movies like "American Pie" or other pointless "teens" movies will not beat the world. His idea is simple: to make your comedy not just funny but SMART funny. But instead of following the brilliant steps of movies like "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity", he used a somewhat unusual approach (and as I understand, he also used this approach for "Guffman"). Whether you notice it or not, improvisation is a very large part of the film. In other words, what the actors say and do is probably not written in the script, maybe not even about the guest and co-founder / star Levy dreaming about it. But with a gentle hand from the guest, he and the actors withdrew the hilarious theatrical performance that would probably have fallen if other, less knowledgeable actors had mastered it. Now it's smart! Of course, the cast is what makes improvisation the most. All of them are a (comedic) miracle, especially a guest of Pepper. But the real standout must be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, a helpless announcer at a competition that can scare the worst funny stories and comments that neither announcer would dream of ... that is if the announcer tried to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly continue and how much the bench press can. There's even a part that gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: to have sexy women in tight shirts and shorts with dogs and they mean something like "having a dog's time style". Its invaluable as well as its performance. I hope people will be involved in this 90-minute "dogumentary". The film deserves so much recognition. She was nominated for Best Picture-Comedy at the Golden Globes, but did not win. I don't see why. It's the best show in comedy. GRADE: A
