This deceptively laid-back, unobtrusive, unobtrusive, unobtrusive thriller, Aussie Crimes, melts with casual ease and relaxed self-esteem, a pleasure to watch. Jimmy, the eager working class beaver (the appealing, easy-going Heath Ledger), longs for something that will make his inexorable ordinary life. Jimmy gets his big break when local criminal pando pando (brilliant Bryan Brown) gives him an easy courier concert that means the old lady gets $ 10. Jimmy finds himself in deep trouble losing Pando's money. Writer / Director Gregor Jordan is an engaging simple story about how things aren't always what they are cracked to be, young love, all the actions that have consequences, and that hoary old chestnut about how crime doesn't pay work as magic thanks and amazing wealth the well-observed tiny unpredictable details, the strong subtext of the man's dueling ability of both good and evil, the nice sense of unwavering irony, the cool, physical way in which violence is presented, and the amazing grounding of all the complexly drawn warts'n'all low-life characters in instant a recognizable and absolutely believable banal day-to-day reality (eg, Panda is shown playing Scrabble with flunky and in one place breaks a business conversation with a cowboy colleague talking to the son over the phone). Judging by his gently shaded and two-fingered imagery of cleverness to keep up with Pand, Bryan Brown no doubt qualifies as one of the best actors to ever boast of cellulose. Robust and satisfying little sleeper.
