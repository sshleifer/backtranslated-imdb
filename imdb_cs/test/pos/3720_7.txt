It is a subgenus of post-apocalyptic future films, a stylish and very intimate installment. The most remarkable element of the film is his silence; nobody speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is apparent in most of his later works, would mean that it is any kind of great trick. I think what makes it so smart and so effective is the fact that without another way of communication, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and emotional transmission, no matter how easy. Even though I haven't been stuck on the screen, I see that it is a very moving and sensitive view of human nature. His vehicle is a stylized sci-fi film. Part of his reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of his people is not necessarily played as a perfect human being: a hero, a lone drifter in a desolate new world, is taken into an older rapist who refuses to keep his part of the food exchange between him and the husky , a brutal character played by Jean Reno, and so Reno tries everything he can, predominantly using brute force, to get what he wants. So the antagonist is right, though not a good man, and the protagonist and his likeable foil are both bad, even though they are both good people. It is a picture in bright and sharp black and white, modified and captured in a low-key, but misty and small scale, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? Like their characters, they are left with the bare needs of communication. This is one of the few really good movies written by Luc Besson. His earlier work is almost always better than the fluff that he spews.
