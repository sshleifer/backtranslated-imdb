It's a simple fact that there are many of us in the 80s who grew up loving those John Cusack comedies that Savage Steve Holland created, and while I prefer another bizarre, out-out movie, better of the dead, it's hard for me Don't Like One crazy summer, a movie that I grew up loving with all my heart as a child. OCS followed up with Better Off Dead, returning from this film by Cusack and Curtis Armstrong. Cusack's Hoops, followed by the graduation of Joel Murray (George) Palace at Nantucket for the summer for every beach fun. Hoops finds himself involved in a dispute with a blond, buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has proposals for bulldozing through neighborhood houses to build a giant condominium. One of the houses that needs a mortgage is Demi Moore (Cassandra). There's a sailboat race that could be their only hope of saving Cassandra's home in his grandfather (who recently went through), but in recent years Teddy has won him and Hoops is afraid of a boat over the water. But with the help and motivation of the newly found friends Nantucket (like Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanic twins!), George, and the promising love interest of Cassandra, maybe Hoops can cope with his fears and win the neighborhood rescue race. Armstrong has a support part as the son of a scaly, manic weapon vendor, General Raymond (Joe Flaherty's SCTV in an inspired casting piece), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and society in their goals. win the race. Memorable Scenes Include Bobcat Stuck In Godzilla's Suit (!), Annoying Throughout Aguilla Beckersted's Model (Mark Metcalf, Barely Recognizable as Teddy's Condominium), Hoops Who Is Chased degenerate young scouts wishing to perform first aid, George is a victim of toxic bloating, Bruce Wagner is a nutty Uncle Frank growing madness every time he tries his best to win $ 1 million from a radio show, and the gorgeous Billie Bird as George Grandma who actually charges the group after the meal! Jeremy Piven, as you guessed it, is a brutal jerk who joins Teddy and causes Hoops and his position, Kimberly Foster's fabulous Cookie (.. Teddy's girl trying to climb Hoops while attending lunch with his father) , and one and only William Hickey as an old man Beckersted who will not reward his son and grandson's legacy if he loses a race on a sailboat. Demi Moore is cute, but this is Cusack's vehicle, although Bobcat and Villard steal most of their scenes. Again, some beautiful animation from Holland is sprinkled over the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriately). If you like his movies, I highly recommend underestimating how I got into college.
