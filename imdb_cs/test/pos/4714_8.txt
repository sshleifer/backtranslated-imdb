I came across this movie on television. I've heard about it before, and I almost changed the channel, but it quickly caught me. The story of the struggle of Burmese people against the military dictatorship provoked. The difficulty of brutality that some are willing to use to maintain power is hard to believe. I am grateful to live in a country where the government is likely not to shoot people on the streets. Laura Bowman's story was a good way to keep the story of the political struggle together.
