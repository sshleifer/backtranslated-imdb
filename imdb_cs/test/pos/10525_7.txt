This interesting lost film (written by Terence Malick) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two miserable, southern brothers on their way to opening a fish restaurant. Margot Kidder was never nicer and Forrest was to be nominated. Originally named The Dion Brothers, this jolly film with a violent end is pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I've been looking for 30 years. Keach was still great at the time and I'm surprised he doesn't have more cult following (maybe he does). These guys are cool with more ambition than brains, but absolutely nice guys! And 7 out of 10. If you can dig it somewhere, you will have fun.
