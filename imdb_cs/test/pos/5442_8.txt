Political satire comedian (Williams), who is forced to run after the collapse of political campaigns and presidents. But we win in shock and make a mockery of the office. "Man of the Year" is not the funniest movie or the best, but it works in small doses. Williams once again joined Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam". These two seem to have great chemistry and work apart. I compare them to Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can imagine. Although I wouldn't say that you are going to dive in and see a movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but it also has a great satire, please, if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4" it's not for you, take your brain with you to see. - ***
