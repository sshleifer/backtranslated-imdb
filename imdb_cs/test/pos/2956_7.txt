The Lone Ranger was one of my child heroes and I never missed a chance to catch his adventure on Saturday morning in the mid-1950s. But this movie came to me until I had the chance to taste it today. Several elements hit me during the story because you have a new Lone Ranger right from the start before you hear the traditional opening of a TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a pretty widespread role, even though he has his share of lumps all over, defeated and shot more than once. Perhaps most interesting of all is that Ranger is actually shooting to kill in several situations, putting his character in conflict with the vision created for the TV series that he never uses his weapon to kill, just to hurt or protect himself and others. . In addition, you have a rather traditional western adventure. Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are murdered by hooded robbers trying to track down five medallions that together make up the key to a fairytale treasure. Interestingly, the villain leader is already a wealthy woman Noreen Nash has inherited. Her top follower is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it wasn't a surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the baddies. Bradford's character was one of the men shot by Lone Ranger, who was wondering how many times it could have happened in the TV series. The quick check revealed that he appeared in the 'Lone Ranger' show, which appeared fifteen times while Kennedy appeared six times. What might be the most interesting of all that is shown is the attempt to portray Indians in revisionist light at a time when television and film western films still portrayed a red man as an illiterate savage. Character dr. James Rolf (Norman Fredric) is the brightest in this regard; it is an Indian who has achieved education and has become a doctor returning to the country of his tribe to take care of the needs of all his citizens. For the purposes of the story, he had to impersonate a white man to be admitted by local farmers. That was the hardest thing for me to actually accept a story because Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of Elder Chief Tomache (John Miljan). That nobody in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew he was really an Indian is something that happened to me. I suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age, but without this story, it made no sense to me that no one else in the tribe knew who he was. I don't know why I'm so interested, but after watching and watching more than two hundred Westerns on this site, I came across three films using a blanket like one in the past month. made by Tonto Scout Horse in this picture. Trigger Roya Rogers made a similar stunt in 1952 "Son of Paleface", and I caught it again in 1958's "Big Country" horse named Old Thunder in that flick. It's like a little comic relief in a situation that wouldn't normally happen to a horse, and now makes me curious when the piece could be done for the first time. I'll have to keep track of old Western times. Not to be exaggerated, Silver also had the chance to shine in the picture, so save the Indian child that was supposed to be used as hostage to the bad guy Brady. Speaking of tricks, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the TV series by donning a disguise as a southern gentleman to blow out the bad guys as hooded robbers. Whenever he did it in half-hour format, it was always smart enough to hide his real features, usually with a beard. One of the most exciting episodes I remembered had to do with Ranger posing as an actor in the mask of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a few clumps I've noticed on the way. In the early stage of opening, the Indian is shot dead by one of the Capuchin robbers and there is blood on his shirt but no hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson go to Indians after they kidnapped one of the jailed villains. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but it turns out that he and Wilson are on horseback.
