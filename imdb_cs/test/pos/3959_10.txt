Film author Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depth of love, passion and fraternity and the devastating consequences of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT. The BLINDSPOT's dead world explodes with tension and takes viewers to a twisted path. the core of the human soul. As a director, he can draw the human spirit from the performance of his actors. With great adjustments, especially in flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is an idea that evokes tension from start to finish. Thriller that leaves a lot in mind. <br /> <br /> What a great success Stephan Woloszczuk has. Cheers Stephane! Angela Sander
