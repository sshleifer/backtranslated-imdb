I have a vacation in Hong Kong now and I saw the cops in the cinema .... what can I say ... it was sooo cool !! <br /> <br /> Everything you could wish for in it! Basically ... you just see it if you can ... I'll have my friend to send me vcd when it comes out .... <br /> <br /> Just a bad thing was a lengthy American style spoke employed by some game actors ... like Edison ... "What's my husband?!" but it has added even more humor iy ... hhehe <br /> <br /> Look at it ... especially if you like any of the following genres: HKfilm, action, comedy, sci fi! SEEITMAN !! Edison also did a good song for it ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
