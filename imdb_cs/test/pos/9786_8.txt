Milo is an overlooked and underrated horror swing from the late 1990s, but the feeling and atmosphere is more than the horror movement of the 1980s. It seems that a bunch of girls will marry to "see things" in Milo's father's office, a gynecologist, and as a reward for seeing what's in the jars (yes, gynecologist and something else ...) one girl playing " doctor "with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and lost her. Now Milo is a scary little child who always has yellow rain, rain or shine, and he speaks funny ... but it's nothing special about him. Fast forward to the present, where these girls are adults, and one of them is scheduled to marry, but the tragedy strikes and leaves one girl out of town with the choice of replacing her friend with a school teacher or not to replace her . she does. And then weird things start to happen again. Which of course includes the little baby in the rain slicker. It is not too violent or graphic, but it has a distinct ghost that you will not find in many modern horrible swings, and it's well worth seeing. One wonders why it's so hard to find some good horror flicks on this day and age, but here's one that is criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you try it out. 8 out of 10.
