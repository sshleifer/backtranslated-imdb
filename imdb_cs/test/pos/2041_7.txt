SPOILERS IN THIS SUMMARY <br /> <br /> Goodnight's long kiss is another example of the common suffering of many modern films; starting with a very interesting concept - a trained murderer whose memory has been erased regains self-consciousness - and the initial setting is engaging, but then it seems that writers don't know very well where to go and the whole thing goes down still confusing and / or indistinct paths, leaving an unsatisfactory taste of something that was fine, but promised to be much better. Baddies are remarkably remarkable, and even Jackson's comical sidekick turn seems more like something of his days before Pulp Fiction; It seems that Harlin, like in Cutthroat Island, has made every effort to ensure that no one can handle his wife. Her character is by far the best of the movie and this fact just feels that you feel even more frustrated that they were not able to do something better with it. However, there is something else about this movie. which distinguishes me from a running Hollywood action player and places it above average if just. It's something very subtle. it is a disturbing, cold, dark, even sick edge, a fearsome and unreal feeling, decadent air, an average band that is still developing in different ways. It's in a dark reddish photograph and the almost constant night the characters are in, it's in Samantha's dream in front of the mirror, it's in her evil eyes and smiles as she prepares to kill a man or when she tells her how to watch her nemesis is dying with a listening daughter, it's in the mitch's comeback behind the wheel of a car, while so much blood can hardly talk from his mouth ... I don't know, it's an atmosphere, something I can't define but which gives me horror (a bit) and It makes this movie oddly interesting to me.
