As I said earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (which was written in this film by writer / director / producer Skip Woods) it's a good movie. It ranks very high up there in my crime flick list between Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically, I think this movie is for me what was for many people - for cult classics - even though I compare it to Pulp Fiction. I don't really like Tarant's first effort, but I'm sure I liked this as much as I did with Pulp Fiction. Great story and good actors. The budget might not be as big as Godzilla, the Mission Avengers on Mars, but surely how hell beats a live crap out of those movies (and many more). This film is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane) who settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, his old friend comes by disrupting his life, revealing his secrets and basically making his day a living hell (and also bloody). . So based on this first and last quality I can assure you that if you like this movie, you will also like Swordfish, which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one, but is just as good (though not bloody and not both sexually tinted). I saw this movie for the second time in the night and I really enjoyed it (again). I think all the characters and actors are good, though I have to give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Poriz, who were the best players (and had the best characters) in the movie. I also have to thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Perhaps, but surely, how the hell a nice and exciting ride to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
