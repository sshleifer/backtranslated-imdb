This film is really worth seeing - Robin Tunney stands out and Henry Thomas proves that it is one of those rarities, the child 'actor' who grows up to become a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn and in the wrong hands due to their depth, they could be unconvincing - but all the actors are simply overwhelming. The cast of this film must stand where it is "Girl, Interrupted" (both films match the great Clea Duvall). Selections and music selections fit perfectly, and there are plenty of actions to prevent the film from becoming a mere character study. If you want a story, you won't find it in this review, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
