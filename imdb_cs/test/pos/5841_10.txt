I've never seen a show with so many stories, secrets, tensions and hard excitement. even barley watch TV but also own every season of this show and it's amazing. Each episode is very well-acted, written and rendered. at the end of the show, I felt that the stories were getting too far because they were in jail, but the actors withdrew it. Soprano sucks huge compared to OZ. in fact, any show that is on the cable network, HBO or not just cant keep the candle to the OZ. I wish he'd come back for the next season. If it happened, they probably would kill every character at the show, but hey, we all have to go sometime. As for the characters, I'd say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. Both were tough in the scene together, but their individual stories that I thought were the strongest of all, except Beecher course, but still ... the best show ever, the best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!
