This movie began to be confusing and grew into one of the best movies I saw ... Acting was absolutely superb, and when I didn't dry my tears, Meryl Streep, who got off, was extraordinary. The film deals with the distant family's troubles, which will cope with a mother who develops terminal cancer. The film was very hard to watch and heartbreaking. The soundtrack tosses this film to the tee. Brava Bette Midler !! From 5 stars I give this 4 1/2.
