The film begins with a board meeting in a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on board for no reason other than being black, and the agency needs a "token" on board. Swope ignores the meeting, reads the Jet Magazine at the big table and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly the Chief Executive curls in place. There is no unnecessary time. The director is called to get rid of the corpse, and the board immediately and recklessly resolves the deal with the election of the new CEO. And as the voices add up, the tension builds up and eventually plunges into a cheerfully ironic culmination of voting that gives the viewer an excellent meal of logical consequences to enjoy the rest of the film. If you've ever spoken back to some silly TV commercial, you'll love to see this movie. Too bad it doesn't seem like there are any real Putney Swopes in the world.
