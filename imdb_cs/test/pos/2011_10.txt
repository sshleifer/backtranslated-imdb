It was a modern television classic! The story looks like this, Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to marry. Bob has a name called Owen he works with. Owen is jealous of Alicia. She likes Bob. Now Owen hangs with Bob and Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very vulnerable to injuries. She's also, if you didn't guess, she's a little lonely. She also hangs with Bob and Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wishes Bob had no friends. By the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen had finally found himself in a real long-time girlfriend. Bob and Alicia went on the night before the wedding and went to a small car and then got stuck. The way out in the middle of nowhere! What happened next? What about poor Heather? Has anyone got married? Sorry, the series is over. Even the TV Guide statement from FOX thought twice about putting it back in the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I also loved Heather. She looked cool in those glasses and was cheerful. I miss this show a lot. This is like reading a good book with the end missing ...... sad.
