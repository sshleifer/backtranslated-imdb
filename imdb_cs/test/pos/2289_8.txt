Many believe this film is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about baseball, but the movie isn't about baseball. Some think that this film is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. This film is about culture. The arrogant American Major Leaguer and the strict Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cannot understand each other. It is after they have succeeded in breaking the cultural barrier they have succeeded in. Ballplayer is becoming more Japanese in its team mentality and the manager of more Americans in enabling individual success, and they will meet on Wednesday. Baseball and romance are subject to this critique of both cultures. Many of them, who have no understanding of Japanese thinking, miss this fact and think it is a film about baseball or romance and see how culture clashes with mild comedy relief. It's not - the clash of culture is the film's gravel. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think that this film has proven quite well in that it has made the Japanese culture too romantic or exaggerated in its portrayal. Overall, I think it is a pleasant and relaxing movie if you understand what it is all about.
