Like most people, I was interested in "More" just because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album I still listen to after all these years. It was quite a surprise to run through the movie in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. It was even more surprising when I realized that it was a pretty good movie. Visually it's pretty beautiful, especially when there are two main characters on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of the music soundtrack, which, if I can say, is exclusively Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a pleasure to watch a movie with my copy of the album next to me, mentally ticking every track as it was used in the movie. Dave Gilmour's Short Interview "The Spanish Piece" was the only one I didn't hear, and several songs are used prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". This second song is lengthy on the album's soundtrack, but works very well during the movie's title sequence, resurfacing at least once. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visuals in my mind. The "More" plot is sometimes difficult, especially when the film seems to be just a vehicle to show how those who are involved in it. But in the end, the film proves that it has more to offer than because the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does ANYBODY use heroin and fully know the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but Stefan's use of heroin seems to be a logical extension of his pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to every Pink Floyd fan who has received the award-winning "More". I also recommend anyone who is interested in counter-culture in the 1960s and how it has been portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this film is because I am too young to experience the first 1960s, but it seems to capture the spirit of time in a way that no other film does.
