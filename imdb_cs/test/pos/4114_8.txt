Much better than generally due to this, this version of "Lost Horizon" had not only great music and beautiful scenery, but also some stunning mountain photos. A few years ago, a special laser disc was released that added more than 30 minutes of previously removed material, extra music and lots of bonus material. So why isn't it on DVD?! Studies are hard to find sometimes. Certainly roles could be given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodic pipe? The man with the song and dance Bobby Van is great fun, Michael York is a good tragic thief and when he saw Sir John Gielgud interpret as Chang, it may sound stupid, but actually works very well on screen. Believe me, you have to check this movie - if you find it!
