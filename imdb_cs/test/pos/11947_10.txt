"One crazy summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when one crazy scene is done, another one will appear. It never allows you to relax. One thing after another. The soundtrack is great. Songs are the right ones for scenes. It's also a clean movie. Little what's dirty in it. Of course, he has a story of guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch money, challenge yourself, and win over people with more resources. Who would want to see it if they failed? There is a serious aspect in which parents and children do not live in the dreams of others. One should always have an open mind and consider all possibilities. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer", parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
