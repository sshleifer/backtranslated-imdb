It is always interesting to catch a line in a movie that is somewhat prophetic for the actor's future. In this case, I was impressed by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the valley" when discussing that lonely screams are trying to control the entire country at Logas. Ten years later, Stanwyck would star as the Barkley family matriarch on "The Big Valley". Somehow I thought she might look older at an earlier picture; I think all those bright clothes and fashionable clothes have a way to bring the youthful side to life. As for my summary above, it is Lee Wilkison's rating John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those keeping outs mentioned earlier, shortly after Parrish uses his military tactics knowledge to with several Wilkison's hands after raiding his ranch and torch his home. I liked the way the film explored his character, starting with the way he dealt with Master Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in the calculated showdown. Setting for ambush was also a clever maneuver, vastly different from the strategy of rushing bad guys with both sides fighting against the last man. For this, Parrish also had something to say - "Never meet the enemy on his terms". "Violent Men" is a good title for this movie, and was probably at the forefront of it's class in the mid-fifties, though today's standards are approaching blood to let one find in "Tombstone" or "Open Range ", where bullets are exactly ugly wildness. But it is shaped by subtle performances from principles, with a partial plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic because it was Stanwyck's character who cheated.
