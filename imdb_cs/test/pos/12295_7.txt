This movie starts somewhat slowly and runs towards the end. Not that it's bad, it was done to illustrate the character character of the main character's degression. So if you're not tragedy, it's not your movie. It is a thought provoking philosophy of this film that is worth it. If you liked Dostoevsky's 'crime and punishment,' you'll probably like it if just for comparison. The interesting question that the film will challenge is: "What is it that a reputable writer completely ignore his publicly-approved ideas for another set?" ideas are totally at odds with the status quo - if you are a conservative, you won't like this movie. Apart from other philosophical questions, I must admit that the film was also aesthetically pleasing. Grassy slopes and beautiful scenery helped me to drive slowly, but it also represented colorful symbolism in the performance of the main characters, if it doesn't affect you, skip it. 7.
