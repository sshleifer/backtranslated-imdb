In 1996, one of the aircraft pilots where I worked gave me a copy of this film. He told me it would cry. I never believed him and we even made bets. After I saw the movie ... I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie I found myself crying in the bathroom. It was actually the strangest movie I've ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother stood up to Erik's mother on a line that went like ... "Your sons' best friend just died today ... and it won't be easy ... if you put your hands back on him ... "I'll kill you!" The last part where Dexter took Erik's shoe was a scene that never left me. Frankly, I'm thinking that my eyes are a tear, a story about what real friendship is about. .. She hated me for letting her see the movie, I shouted a bucket, exclaimed the river.
