I tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this movie, while the vast majority of reviews have ratings between 7 and 10. The reason may be this movie is a bit hard to describe in a positive review, even though they've done it pretty nicely. This film is confusing, depressing and has no happy ending. I still awarded Pola X a rating of 10 because it's basically a literature and art combined on film. That's really my favorite kind of movie. I only saw two Carax movies: this and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm somewhat cocky when I call it one of Carax's best films - but I'm. Carax has a minimalist style. If this type of film doesn't appeal to you and is boring, then it would be best to watch this. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so he had enough intensity for the thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorbing. Two major roles had an excellent job. (I mean lead and a young woman he thought was his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role wasn't too big or significant in the story. But they all did a great job. I thought cult things were great. Maybe it wasn't very believable, but that's because it's more abstract. There is much going on between the lines in this movie. This is a very Freudian psycho-thriller.
