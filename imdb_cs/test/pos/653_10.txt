In the early 1980s, I uploaded Honky Tonk Freeway from a cable. Since then, I have been hoping it will be on DVD. I found it yesterday. It's one of the best humorous studies of characters I've ever seen. The old-fashioned episode is priceless. At that time (4/28/02), only two of them examined it. One hated him, the other loved him. If you have a DVD player, either rent it or buy it like me.
