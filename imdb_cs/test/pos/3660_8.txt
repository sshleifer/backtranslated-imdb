I was so happy to hear that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this movie three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and awaiting its release since I could send all that I know to see it. It's like a trip to India .... colorful, magical, provocative thinking. Besides one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase the scene this movie is very realistic. It is not a Bollywood-style song and dance movie, but it has drama and romance and humor. The interaction between an Indian taxi driver and a French tourist is a good reflection of the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a bit wider, but the acting was very good. Visually, this film is a treat because you really feel that driving through Rajasthan is like ... dreamlike. Sometimes it is hard to believe that everything you see and experience is real ... the film is of the same quality. Great soundtrack!
