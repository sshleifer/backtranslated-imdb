Great movie. Post-apocalyptic movies kick ass. This exception is no exception. He kept the pace and interest without the commotion of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild mankind became without their technology and guzzalin. The connection between the start and the end was a bit spacious, which means I could hardly understand the distance between the hotel and the opening sequence. In short, digging character character, design, story without pillow dialogue, and most importantly, always appreciated desolate scenery of post-apocalyptic wasteland.
