WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! This is written for movie viewers who may have gone away from "Mood for Love" confused and confused about the ways the heroes choose in their lives. From reading other comments and reviews, it seems that many viewers and critics have missed some very important details that prevented them from enjoying this wonderful movie joke. We are so used to seeing the obvious SEX in the narrative that we have forgotten that at a time when filmmakers had designed a "dirty deed" by simply showing that couples in sleds or the sleigh rides only to return to the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck ... "Meet your baby". The director chose the same nostalgic approach to telling the story of Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan. Last warning ... SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> Mr. Chow Madam Chan to show his real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. Next scene: Mrs. Chan tilts her head to Mr. Chow in a taxi and says, "I don't want to go home tonight." Translation: Why then do a couple just not do modern stuff dumping their cheating spouses, get a divorce, raise their child of love and live happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the 1960s. Bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were a child of an adulterer, while a "legitimate" child could live a tragic but noble life if his mother decided to tear him away from his "father" - invisible Mr. Chan. In short, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan sacrifice their relationship for the future of their child. That's why Mr. Chow, who learned that Mrs. Chan lives alone with a little boy, gives a conscious smile and ends her children. she dreams that Mrs. Chan will have Mrs. Chow. Then he also realizes why Mrs. Chan went all the way to Singapore to be with him, just to think again and leave at the last moment. She decided never to see him again. He lives with this wonderful secret and no one tells him. No one except the crumbling wall of the temple and, of course, the viewer ... but only when we listen carefully.
