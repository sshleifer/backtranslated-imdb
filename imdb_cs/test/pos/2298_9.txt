After reading more than my fair share of reviews for a huge number of different movies, I noticed a certain trend, people judge hard on what they expected. I'm counting on you going into an open-minded movie that doesn't expect anything certain before you have better feelings about it than trying to watch, but you have pre-built standards you want to achieve. Because I am trying to be hypocritical I watched this movie with very clean slate and open mind, and was very pleased. Since it is not a mainstream title or a victory in this matter, I did not know what to expect, but in fact I enjoyed it much more than the Ninja Scroll. Beautiful animation, deep story, and always joyful ninja hack-n-slashing very well combined with one of my personal favorite anime ever done. <br /> <br /> I'm not promising you to enjoy it, but just give it a chance and you can come up with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before you talk, make sure what you say is more beautiful than silence" - Chinese proverb
