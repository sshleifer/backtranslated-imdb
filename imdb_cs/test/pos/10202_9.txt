That's a hidden gem. It has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status and deserves all of the above! One of the great movie directors, Fritz Lang, has created a true gem in this outstanding Western world. A gentle cast led by Randolph Scott (probably one of his greatest performances), always a robust Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly perfect dude and many veteran actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and other exciting Zane Gray story about cable laying Western Union across the country. She has tense drama, humor sprinkling and great effects. It reminds us of the DeMille way, and Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it. At least it's a damn good western!
