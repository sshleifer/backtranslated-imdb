In Mississippi, former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife, who just left him. He finds out that the urban slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) have set off on the road near her small farm, dazed, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, gives her medicine and nursing and nourishes her as a father and holds her strapped to control her warmth. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is released from the army because of his anxious question, she does not understand Lazarus and Rae's relationship and tries to kill him. "Black Snake Moan" is a strange story of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive performance as a young hiker who has been abused by father since childhood and has had sex with the whole city where he lives. It's the amazing versatility of this actress, and probably it's the most mature work I've ever seen playing Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard in a movie, with beautiful blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
