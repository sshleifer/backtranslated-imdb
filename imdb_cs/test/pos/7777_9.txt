It is a pity that this film has not received more theater plays. It is a rich, textured love story with believable, too human characters who are too busy playing games and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is its setting in Chicago, among modern, artistic, literate, mid-class African-Americans who discuss poetry, music and literature. Next is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate - and if you're half his fan, you have to see this movie! His boyish cockiness and vulnerability are ideal for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who longs to tell Darius she loves him, but is afraid of the "Rules" break. Great movie to watch curled up on the couch with your pet!
