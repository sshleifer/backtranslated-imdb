Chaplin enters the trenches of World War I in this witty comedy that never threatens the horrors of war. Rain, Mud, Explosions - All these things are present, but Chaplin forgets them all. One thing in France is to fight the Germans, something they do with incredible success. Nearly it looks like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - very funny, until the last minute as he rises to a new level of poignity and everything makes sense. Maybe that's what all the soldiers dream of before going to war.
