Alexander Nevsky is a series of outstanding film opera sequences that goes from pastoral to lamentation and ends in a triumphant cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats German Knights in the battles on the ice of Lake Peipus. The film is a wonderful historical procession that shows director Sergei Eisenstein on his most inventive pictorial, and peaks in an excellent battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998), and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then grounded as possibly the most influential Soviet-made historical film.
