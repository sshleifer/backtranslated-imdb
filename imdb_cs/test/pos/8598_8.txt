Where to start? In 1993, I came across this and just got into the "record" of the video recorder out of habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" is certainly not ... but if you have had a bad day and are in the mood to come across something that is not too intellectually challenging, then I have tentatively indicated that it can only be your "thing". We have a lot - great title track, more stereotypes than you can shake your wand, unconscious comedy, the most beautiful battle scene of all time and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays a diametric opposite of his role in the 60s of the classic "Blow Up" - still a photographer, still hormonally stimulated, but not "completely" the same. John Philip Law is an easy to slam an actor who makes a log look unwooden, but he wouldn't be fair to see how he had about 5 minutes notice before taking a role. Wexler as "Amanda"? Just say it was her only movie role! But the real star of this movie is Ethel Evans, who plays, let's say a secretary (?), With the morale of the aisle and the ambitions for the match. The way she manages to reconcile her present life with the life of the future with her comedy husband is in fact touching in an earthy, bold, co-is-to-be-to-be-be way. In fact, I love this movie when I'm in the mood ....... and I don't touch it with the bargepole saying when I'm not. Kudos's cast for keeping (relatively) straight faces while shooting. <br /> <br /> "Classic" at Edward Wood's School of Film Effort!
