As part of the BBC's filming of all Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my strange impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most revised games and Hamlet is not particularly mobile and tragic in nature. I don't feel any sympathy for him and I haven't been following this. Although you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of Dan, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, he can't disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects into her, she makes the whole role unintelligible. I couldn't combine his character physics with what he said, and that killed me. This means he is right "To be or not to be" because his dagger actions clearly explain the character's suicidal intentions at this point in the game. Supporting roles, for me better written and subsequently better played, are enjoyable, especially Lalla Ward's loop Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius. At four and a half hours, it's very long and best watched in size bites. Look at it if you're interested, but be prepared for a long watch.
