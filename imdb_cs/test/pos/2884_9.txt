In dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, removed a number of characters, and generally implied rather than showed Dorian's basic anger. If you want explicit plotting, check out the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived within the same timeframe, but they were definitely different men and writers. This story really treats a theme similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ", but note that Wilde decided to treat his story as a fantasy while the RLS set out on a scientific journey. Both protagonists are men in which there are good wars with evil, with bad victory at the end. The actors in this BBC movie are also on a different path from those in the 1945 movie. John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical blows as George Sanders, in his role he actually projects Wilde but with a slight difference. You will suspect that Sanders really believed what he said, but Gielgud can say what is expected of him, rather than what he sincerely believes. Also, Peter Firth shows both sides of his characters in a limited fashion, but then we don't get to see how many of his escapades, as Hurd Hatfield was supposed to exhibit. It is a very good production, with dramatization reflecting the foundations of the novel, if not all its consequences.
