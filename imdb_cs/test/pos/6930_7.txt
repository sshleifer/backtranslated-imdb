This film includes two actors (Caine and Moran) trying to create a gangster. The storyline is fragile at best, because there are several holes in it. However, this should not be important because a comedy should have such a film. There are some really funny pieces (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that can't add anything to the movie. It seemed to me that Caine's character was exaggerated. Especially at the beginning he quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. You could say that he plays the role correctly, but the character seemed to me to be rude and rude. Overall, I would say he would see if he was a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for the video or TV.
