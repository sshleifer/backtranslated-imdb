Anyone who likes a cool, unforgettable tempting movie. Alain Delon provides anti-hero, Melville provides cool, and a handful of other great talents (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte, and especially Andre Bourvil, mostly) come to add a sharp shot ... <br /> <br /> ... with very little dialogue. This is great because one of the aspects of the genre is the many dialogues that involve witnesses and their various redresses. However, this movie could be watched with the sound completely turned off and missed too much. I'm not saying that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazz soundtrack and the sharp sound of the small movements cause slow, patient patient judgment very convincing. What is really nice about this movie is that color cinematography is quite fantastic. Usually, when it comes to cinematography, black and white films tend to stick to my mind, but this film has some very powerful and beautiful images that make the film a pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
