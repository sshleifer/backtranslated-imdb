Daffy Duck has stamps hanging from every inch of every tree that says it's a rabbit period. But you guessed - it's really a duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter who's stupid enough to gag. It's even worse. When Bugs Bunny approaches him and asks how rabbit hunting goes, Elmer admits he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. That's more than Daffy. He gets out of hiding and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "Silence," Bugs says. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does. After Daffy returns his beak from head to head, he is condemned to other arguments that are infected with a "pronoun problem" that have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses as a sexy woman and flirts with Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy get his last laugh? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic cartoon? The bug dreads with fear as Daffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says, "Yes?" when dripping with self-satisfaction. Daffy Duck stands on tiptoes demanding to shoot. Elmer Fudd whines that "can't wait for wonger." Daffy sees mistakes in women's clothing, and his tongue is that little noise. Carl Stalling plays "You Must Be a Beautiful Child" during Bugs's drag act. Daffy demands "utter sincerity" of mistakes. Existing "Home Sweet Home" games at an inappropriate time. Daffy tells Bugs he is "desthpicable". Five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short is available on "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disk 1. \ t
