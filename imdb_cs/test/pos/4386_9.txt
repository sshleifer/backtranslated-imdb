I saw all of Coen's movies and I must say that it's one of their better films. I wouldn't dare say it's better than "The Big Lebowski," but it was very good in his own right. I thought the story was occasionally very interesting and cheerful. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). There's really nothing wrong I can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone. It could be safe to say that if you liked other Coen movies, then you will enjoy it. And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you will like the movie, but you do not hold me to it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I hope you like the movie. just like me. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
