Someone rated this film as "a waste of time" because it expected "beautiful scenery of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything looked "washed out" or gloomy, or something like that. I believe this person has missed the whole part of the movie. This is reality. The aim of this film is to show that life is not, in fact, ideal, and to show what people are going through in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his slum in Brazil in Sao Paolo to die in Portugal after his death to visit his mother's home. He finds out that not everything is free, and that the native of Portugal is looking down on Brazil. He eventually finds life, love, but the story does not end as expected and that is not the story of "fairy tale". The biggest part of me was the last song "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It fits well with the film; especially the end.
