Wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animated movie Astérix! and it's so good to hear Roger Carel again making the voice of Astérix! Certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the Astérix comics! but I recommend that you look at the French version because it is definitely the best and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel played Astérix for almost forty years? I think he did a great job! and the song from Céline Dion at the end fits good results! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are amazing ... in one word: a masterpiece! go see it! you will not regret!
