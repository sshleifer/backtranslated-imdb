I watched the 8th MS Gundam again for the second time. It's much better than the Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get the DVD and see what's been changed from the show. It's great to see Gundams actually move around clumsy across the ground. Someone was really thinking about writing this move script. <br /> <br /> Look today.
