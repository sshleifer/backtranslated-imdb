The opera opens with a very detailed shot of the bird's eye, so one of the more bizarre and fun features of Argento begins (my second favorite in fact, Deep Red). Although the film is sometimes absurd (lack of real worries for murder, bird attack, burnt dummy that ends ??), but this is the fantastic world of Argento and once you deal with it, you'll find it works. However, I do not want to completely reject these mistakes, rather than being more than a work of art for them. For example, the aforementioned bird attack is totally over-the-top in theory, but look at its amazing execution; Crows fly in chaos and add their enraged jerks to rock driving, a crowd in panic as seen through circling, camera-based camera work, and then a focused attack; Really scary horror. Argento is a stunning, fluid cinema that is fully exhibited in Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the film. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of opera themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with everyone that was used effectively (rock throws with murders in perfect timing and gives scenes a very furious feeling). Sound effects also deserve nods, stings, scissors, beaks and all. Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen a lot of your movies. Yes, you are really an expert in this field. We would be very interested in your opinion." that it is unwise to use movies as a guide for reality, not an inspector? "<br /> <Inspector Alan Santini:" It depends on what you mean. " As it is a giallo, style murders are a must and Dario will not disappoint (the "bullet door" scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot if you forgive a pun). Deep, pulsating, pulsating (cool shot!) The black glove killer is cool and brutal, and under his hero, he has tape pins so that she is forced to watch the killings that were nice. All they said as giallo, Opera doesn't have as good a secret as it should. The killer is kept secret from the audience, but little effort is made in the film to really solve the murders. This and the strange ending could use more work. Despite these problems, Opera is still a useful and satisfying horror movie. Last note: it was nice to see the movie, once, show the right view through the telescope (just a circle, not two circles together)! Nice eye for detail, Daria!
