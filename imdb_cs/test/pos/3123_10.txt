I don't think I really have spoilers here, but since I am describing some funny scenes, I check that the box says it could contain spoilers to be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I hardly know where to start. Now you know the basic story overview - Horse Traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) have taken the Mormon Train Train to the west to their "Promised Land" and meet many different experiments and interesting characters on the way, especially family of outlaws Clegg. Everyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a Western fan to enjoy it. For one thing, Johnson and Carey are the two fastest likeable characters you'll see in every movie. Especially Carey is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, a bit like an older brother. I get a kick from the scene where they sell one of their "fine horses" sheriff for ten dollars; then inform him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you may say he is failing" ... Travis's elbows Sandy, who relaxes with a piercing whistle, sends the sheriff's new horse to a wild strut that sits in the saddle. The look at his face, finally throwing him out and galloping away, is priceless. Pay attention to music ... although you never thought you'd be a fan of the pioneers' sons, listening to "Shadows in the Dust" as the wagon train is shown moving with some people walking alongside the wagons. It's a really beautiful song - too bad just half a minute or so in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing sometimes. One thing that really impressed me on this film is that much of it has to be almost as heavy as the real situation it portrays. Teams of six horses pulling cars into steep mountain trails, strenuous to take to the top - it was no easy and easy movie. It must be risky for actors, stunt people, and animals. This film, which also creates rivers, has a lot of authentic looks that include the movement of a train. It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years of riding and rope experience, and doing all kinds of cowboy stuff. Carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians and actually learned to talk to Nava before he learned to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this film - "Travis" and "Sandy" were real things through and through. Watch the scene when Miss Denver throws a pan of water out of her car, hits the horse's horse Travis in the face ... the horse starts to buckle and eventually throw it away. Look at Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis, "I'm sorry you fell from your horse." Another my favorite scene is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets a little tiff with one of the Mormons. They work back to back and prepare their equipment, and after Sandy is disgusted by a second colleague, they both get into the back of a crash struggle, which quickly turns into a combat struggle on the ground. . Even after the older (Ward Bond) builds them up and separates them, both fighters are trying to make themselves. Mormon (named 'Jackson' in the movie) gets one last kick in Sandy so high he hits the shoulder. It's a really fun scene from start to finish. I do not know what else I can say about this film other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and a lot of actions balanced by humor and a bit of drama. It was colored, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you ever see, but I think I prefer black and white. I give it ten and I don't give many ten. One of my favorite movies, no doubt. And judging by other comments, I have a lot of company in this review.
