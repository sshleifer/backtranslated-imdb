Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's Saved by Bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it right to give this movie a 10 'rating? Hahahahahaha ... that's funny. However, this film was not so terrible; better than I expected. Movies made for television are often so similar. Many of them feel the same. This one had the same feeling, but it worked even though it was another tortured woman who had to get b * stard in the final story. Before it started, I imagined Mrs. Thiessen as a 90210 seducer, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, who was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing my role really well. With some decent writing, the director got him a pretty good, convincing performance without being cheesy. Overall, it was somewhat interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My grade: B-
