Today we live in sad times, in which every comedy movie and TV show seems to be painfully indecent and caused by cheap, gross or bad humor. Most people don't know what it means to really laugh at comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw Momma From Train". With a little hesitation, I say it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, from start to finish. The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted that we laugh in many instances. Don't be fooled by a plot of murder. The story is not serious enough to give us care or worry about what happens. The story includes a young man (Danny DeVit) who wants to get rid of his annoying annoying mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a role that I think was absolutely flawless) by killing Billy Crystal. Which Crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel. I don't want to spoil jokes and gags in this movie, but all I can say is that you have to see this movie if you want to laugh. A fast run and a real experience, a true comedy experience and a type of movie you don't see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
