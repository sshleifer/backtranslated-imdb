During the Civil War, a wounded union soldier hides in an isolated confederate school; where the headmistress and the school teacher decide to take care of him and keep him until the problems start to arise between lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but in the end it is worth it. "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was taken at the same time as "The Beguiled") could be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing it, I tend to to think to be the best couples. A very atypical, subtle and stylish Eastwood vehicle is always on the lookout with the richly driven direction of Don Siegel and the scary Lalo Schifrin musical score. Strongly featuring his sultrily lurid and bleak nature that is intrusively embedded in the movie psychological make-up and manipulative strangle to hold sexual depravity. It is steadily played and makes it more tense and blood clotting when these random shocks and malicious intentions take hold of tension. The way Siegel illustrates the appealing brave script of John B Sherry and Grimes Grice (taken from Thomas Cullin's novel) is effectively implemented through sharp emotions and the tense, lyrical context of the script. Siegel's strong direction captures an idyllically southern Victorian setting with such heavily decorated photographs and he prepares some strangely piercing images with great clarity and restraint. They are truly commendable and of high quality during the performance. Clint Eastwood as a smoothly refreshing, sweet-talking chameleon union soldier is very impressive and pleasantly assured. Deeply Geraldine Page steals the image as a stiff head of lady and elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds her innocent character to a subtle sincerity. Mae Mercer is heavily adapted as a black maid and Jo Ann Harris is picking crops from young pupils with her seductively crafty person. Frankly, while the charismatic character of Eastwood plays a field for his own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that the one who plays (where rivalry between women creeps) is not better than their guest. at the end. Throughout the material, there is a perverted dark sense of humor and ironic touch. What is shown here is simply more than just your basic shock, but one that is heavily layered with intrigues and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. This also applies to his extremely scary title and final song. Effective Cooling, a low key item that is not hard to be tempted to be that swinging hospitality.
