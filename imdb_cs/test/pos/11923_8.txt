It's really not worthy of 'best picture' reasoning, but as fun goes, it does the job! That's the one I watched, with pulse acceleration every time, at least ten times. Most of these actors were unknown at the time, and we can recognize them from other work. Those who do not have the current recognition of the name do not want it. <br /> <br /> This was ADVENTURE fun. A little like The Little Rascals if they just had to be serious.
