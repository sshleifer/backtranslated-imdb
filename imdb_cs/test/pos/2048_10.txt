When this movie came out, I saw Geena Davis play only soft, feminine roles ... This movie was something but soft and feminine. Great line, great action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for children, but if you and your significant others are trying to make a movie, try it for size. Go Geena! Go Geena!
