David Suchet is Agatha Christie's detective who appeared in 2005 in the band "After the Funeral". figure. Suchet is Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I admit the love of Peter Ustinov in his role, his portrayal does not have much in common with what Christie wrote. In this episode Poirot is asked by a legal friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. The solitaire goes to the train and tells the events after death - the strange inheritance of the anticipated heir and the statement of the sister of the man that he was murdered. When Poirot meets the family, adultery, a lot of secrets, more wills and murder appear. <br /> <br /> The story is superb with rich production values ​​and a wonderful detail of the time period. All performances are excellent, especially from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon, but he's still effective. I had the privilege to see David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus". Breathtaking. What actor - when playing Poirot, I see IS Poirot.
