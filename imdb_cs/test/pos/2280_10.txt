Mr. Baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc√© Susan Nauss. Susan said she was looking forward to the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a tough but honest manager makes sense. Ken Takakura has done so many beautiful Asian movies, correcting one reviewer and saying that Takakura is still a film presence with movies like Hotari. Of course everyone likes Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is a better dramatic actor of both. Someone accused me today of being a Yakuza, but I say that my big uncle Shadow President Jack F Kennedy himself and others are part of the legitimate human leadership in our universe and thanks to our co-owners People are free people fighting all parts of adversity that President Kennedy spoke in his inaugural address. To be honest, someone has kept food prices in Canada low as bread. In honor of our CoCreators, stop eating reptile and egg amphibians. I hope that one day he will continue to be a manager with Mr. Basak and his father Ken Takakura Oda. I thank the IMDb for promoting freedom of expression, as I support President George W. Bush. IMDb support.
