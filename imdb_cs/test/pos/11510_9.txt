I've seen this movie many times. I read the book Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Mar Guðmundsson, who received Scandinavian book awards for this work. The movie does not start in the same place as the book begins. It happens in Reykjavik and the main character, Pall is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But as the relationship collapses with him, he begins to take headaches that annoy him and angry. And soon it will begin to have great mental problems and then the film will begin. Soon he is deployed to an Icelandic psychiatric hospital called "Kleppur" and there you will see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and Oli who thinks he writes all the songs "The Beatles" and sends them to them think. transport. Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who plays the role of Pálla, works so well that he leaves you breathless. Also, the music in this film is angry with SIGURROS and you should only see a movie for music. Overall, a great movie wanted to be seen.
