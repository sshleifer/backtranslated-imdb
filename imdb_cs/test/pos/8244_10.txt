I have to say that I know Mr. Ã–rnek's documentary films, so I knew I would get a very well-crafted film documentary. I wasn't disappointed. As a nerd historian - I have seen hundreds of documentary films and I liked the different approach to this work. The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) tried to approach the realities of gallipoli through solder letters from both sides. History is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. Narrated is this documentary by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both increase the intensity and emotionality of this documentary with their big voices. > <br /> I saw this movie in a movie theater in Dolby Surround, Italy. I bought the DVD last year and will be waiting for 3-7 years again for the work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. Summary: Okay. Intensive. History with Emotions - Wrapped in a war document with great storytellers
