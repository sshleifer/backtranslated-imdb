This is the middle three cartoon (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And is the weakest of the three, while it's still pretty funny. It just depends on one gag for too much action. Still good cartoon. I feel unequivocal sympathy for Daffy in this, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly overcome that sometimes it becomes painful. Good cartoon in excellent series. Recommended.
