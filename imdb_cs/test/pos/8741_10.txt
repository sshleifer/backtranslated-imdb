From or around 1965, American films turned to a shocking and iconoclastic film that was great for these times - a kind of seed that would pave the way for bolder and bolder dramas. However, since the decade itself has been dominated by its own beliefs, most of the films released during this period are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Her own name suggests a "sunny" romantic comedy with occasional blackouts. This does not mean that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, films on risqu√© topics have to start somewhere and America is a culture rooted in specific traditions, which itself is in deep hypocrisy, shocking itself when it sees indirect reflections of time. Meanwhile, European films deal with these same situations, leave as millions of dollars and have a longer shelf life, because what we consider scandalous shrugs, says "Next" and goes on. Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in her escape role), a young, very young sixty-year-old girl, takes care of a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) who has a commitment problem. He can't marry her: he's already married. Instead of reversing, Toni decided she wanted to meet her wife and "put things straight." His assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (light Ingrid Bergman, who returns to the American cinema after twenty years of absence) comes to the picture, a woman closer to his age, which behaves as if she had a perfect marriage and a home. It is why she kept quiet emotions for Julian, which she does not know about, even if she asks her to play her wife to discourage Toni from pursuing her relationship. And then he will do it step by step, when Toni's blissfully innocent actions begin an unexpected event and introduce Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephen's "mistress". By the way, Harvey is also an older gent who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eva Bruce), who also lies in one very funny scene. It's funny how the person we're looking for is the one who has always been there. What could be for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor neighbor, an ungrateful role that turns into a man who not only sees the real beauty of a fellow outcast Stephanie, but also a person who in the beginning saves Toni to kill herself. (It's not a comedy, suicide. Then it's not your average comedy.) And needless to say, Ingrid Bergman is a delicate, irritated image of a woman who somehow lacked her chances of love that has become a prick that has been told by a lie. that she has become a real person who should always be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but profound task. a deep symbolism that, like its name, carries deep inside. It's a tricky movie, just as Hawn's and Bergman's performances are just as complicated because they seem so simple, free of flowering and poses, not coming out and claiming what they are about. Their acting becomes "idle" but plays real people, warts and all. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems too serious, but in the end it turns out to be deep and very human.
