It pays to watch Digest readers. Or Time if it was the original source of the article that served as an alleged inspiration for Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on the true story of a adopted girl looking for her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam painted a classic that rivals as much as it troubles him, loves as much as he preaches and preaches, as he does. Where to start? A premonition that precedes a fresh dispute in northern Sri Lanka? A chaotic household of a family led by a fire brand technician and 3 delightfully naughty children? Or the dark region where reality intersects a place that provides a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of unbelievers and ominous events and ideologies? No matter how you look at it, it is worth having this movie in your collection if you like similar dramas Mani Ratnama. Mr. Ratnam is a past master in mixing fictional stories in real life events, and in this film shines a class in adapting two real stories into one. I won't go into the story because it's better to see than read. But what I dwell on is the impact he had on me, and why, for all the war mongings that are happening in this world, it cannot destroy this simple but inexhaustible power called hope. Innocence, in its purity, cannot understand the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. He doesn't even know the danger of being accompanied by a sharp determination to look for what he wants. It is an innocence of the kind that drives Amudha to seek out its biological parents, despite the warning that they might be lost in the Civil War cauldron. After surviving the terrorist experience of talking to a physically attacked person, only to realize that he is a more disruptive entity in disguise, Amudha keeps her causes in a way that will pull down the resistance of her supporters. Finally, when they meet, mother and daughter, the meeting is so tense that even a lively adoptive father is reduced to tears. The scene that follows is supported by the corrosive background score from R Rahman, which is touching to melt even the nicest hearts: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask for a biological mother. In culmination as dramatic as the sequence of events that led to it, the child reveals his mother, alive in the body, but lost in spirit. With the overwhelming realization that he has no hope of staying with who carries her, Amudha will make her adoptive mother, which means the title of this film: a peck on her face. As far as the cast is concerned, the trail is clearly radiated by the brilliant PS Keerthan. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of making a spectacular performance from little-known children's artists, but it shouldn't take anything from Keerthana for award-winning performance. With the ability to cast Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and stunning Nandita Das (Shyama), they decorate scenes in almost every frame in which they are. Music doesn't have to be as memorable as the other Rahman offerings, but it still didn't stop him from getting another National Award for Best Musical Direction. "Vellai Pookal" is still an ode to the need to love human life as it is for nature. Dialogues are first-class (the Amudha and Indira touch-swap show on the swing, shortly after the revelation that Indirina's biological daughter is not) and cinematography are excellent. This film is a clear statement to get rid of weapons just like respect for human life and manifestations. It does not judge it as a filmmaking lesson; from Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman you will only lose one of the best.
