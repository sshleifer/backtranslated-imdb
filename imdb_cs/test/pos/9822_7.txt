I read about 10 reviews of this movie, but I didn't "take" any of them. Harrison Ford is criticized for everything from his hairstyle to the earring and I really don't see what's related to these movies. As I recall, he had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but it's still the most popular among us videophiles. It's slower than most of his previous movies, but isn't worthy of the trashings she received. I'd like to pay $ 7.50 for watching a bald Harrison Ford cut his lawn.
