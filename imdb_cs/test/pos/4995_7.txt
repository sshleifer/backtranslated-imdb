I think the consensus in this recent miniseries is totally unanimous: it's okay, but it's far from "Lonesome Dove." It is likened to the latter simply because of this prequel to this famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely worth watching all Western fans. Don't expect it to be as intense as "Lonesome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two guys. Some say it is unfair to criticize this film for comparison, but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae." The main difference I found was that this prequel is much slower and more relational (two Rangers and their women) at times. Yet it didn't bother me because the two main women were beautiful ladies and generally nice and pleasant people. They play Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie.") .. They helped make this long film tasty. If you saw pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked half as Cardelini and Banks. It was a pleasure for these male eyes. Maggie's son "Newt" was also an amazing boy - the kind of boy every parent would want .. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character I thought turned out to be "Inish Scull" by Val Kilmer . As in the Western movie, "Tombstone," Kilmer almost steals the show from lead. "Scull" is really the original when I saw one: weird dude, really. Actually, all supporting actors have done a great job here, from Keith Robinson's "Deets" to Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump". I always consider studios to be fascinating, no matter what role they play. I wish he had a bigger role in this miniseries. One thing this movie has to do with "Lonesome Dove" and other good Westerns: scenery and photography. Sometimes it's beautiful and it's a pleasure to watch. We also have an outstanding director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another outstanding television western, "Crossfire Trail". He also made two of my other favorite feature films, both based in his home country of Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under". Unfortunately, although I enjoyed it, "Commanche Moon" is nothing as good as the above movies. Still, I watched it all and I was sorry it ended if it made sense. I wanted to watch Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says it's 360 minutes. This had to include TV ads. The double-disc version of the DVD I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
