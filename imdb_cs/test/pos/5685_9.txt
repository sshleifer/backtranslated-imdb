I live here in the croc and I remember the real events that inspired this film. Our courage falls out every time we hear a crocodile attack. BLACK WATER is just the best I've ever seen. Although I loved ROGUE all its effects and splashy last year, it was the local scenes that captured our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything else. But BLACK WATER really resonated with the fright and fear you can experience when you are in the mangroves yourself (you call them swamps or dressings - but they are mangroves). Every tourist should see this film before heading to the Northern Territory. The end was a bit late for the rest of the movie, but I will add this one to my DVD collection when it becomes available.
