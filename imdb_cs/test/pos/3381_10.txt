After I was addicted to the mini series, "North & South", I couldn't wait for the sequel, "North & South II." A few years later, Book III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III." Finally, the last installment came on the ongoing saga of Maine and Family Hazard. I was so angry with this series that I recorded every part of the TV and then managed to get the family and friends addicted and watch it AGAIN every time someone wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I long for this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all worked out. Do yourself a favor and demand this DVD set!
