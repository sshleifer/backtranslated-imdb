This version of "Romeo and Juliet" passes in Manhattan today. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a hole and a violent member of the Que and Juliet family (Jane Jensen) is sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and a bisexual Capulet girl. The scatological situations that this romantic couple will face are very funny. Although it is an iconic film (including at the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended to all viewers. If the viewer is a fan of the former films of Peter Jackson ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and other garbage movies, this movie will definitely fall in love. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my voice is eight. <br /> <br />
