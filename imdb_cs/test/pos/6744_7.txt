In this crackerjack noir thriller from Columbia, which is a combination of Panic In The Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is unwittingly The Killer That Stalked New York. Evelyn, who smuggled some stolen jewels into Cuba, also smuggled into smallpox. He gets a misdiagnosed doctor William Bishop and when he finds out what it is, hunting is for her. For most of the movie, the Treasury is also hunting Keyes, but for contraband jewelry. It's not nearly at the end of the film that the medical department and law enforcement are aware that they are looking for the same woman. Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband Charles Korvin left her flat, the cruelest cut of all being that he was crazy about with his sister while she was in Cuba collecting gems and contracting smallpox. When Lola Albright as her sister commits suicide throughout the affair, Evelyn is on a mission, gets Korvin or dies trying. And given this situation, it's not a terrible threat. The film was mostly filmed in New York City as The Naked City and its cast is symmetrically sprinkled with lots of familiar names and faces. Watch out for good performance by Connie Gilchrist as dissatisfied owner Evelyn, Jim Backus as a clever club owner and Art Smith as Korvin's fence. <br /> <br /> A real sleeper in the noir category, don't miss out if it's aired.
