"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each one itself would be enough for a great episode. So when you put them all together, you have a big episode ^ 3. It was a daring move that gave the flashbacks of the season finale (Desmond), which until then only appeared in 3 episodes, but it worked: its backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch how informative about the past and the swan station itself and sincerely moving. Desmond and Penny seem to be magically connected, even though they are at the opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully bred (it's hard not to hear when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action inside the hatch is strained at the edge of the seat because Locke is determined not to allow the button to be pushed again, convinced it was just a psychological experiment, Desmond is gradually realizing the consequences of this decision, and Eco is locked out and desperately trying to get inside . Melting hours and Locke's "I'm wrong" are unforgettable moments. The external action has Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley captured by others due to Michael's betrayal (after they make the mysterious discovery associated with the Pearl), and "Henry Gale" is a play-changing comeback as the leader of the others. Even the least important line plot, Sayid, Jin, and Sun sailing to the beach, where others are allegedly camping, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, a giant statue that is almost completely absent, with the exception of a four-fingered foot. In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + tension + threat of destruction + ray of hope = classic LOST episode. *** 1/2 of 4.
