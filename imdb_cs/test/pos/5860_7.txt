This is about a murder detective who fights several young wealthy children who have nothing better than to plan a complex murder and cover it up, they seem to outsmart the police forces seemingly at will. they mock the detective by dropping tracks and leading them to a wild goose chase. this has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie, Sandra Bullock does a great job in this one as a woman on the edge, she's not sure and fights her inner demons, she can't seem to keep a man in her life, that they leave it for some reason. Overall, it's not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing all the way in a very shocking ending.
