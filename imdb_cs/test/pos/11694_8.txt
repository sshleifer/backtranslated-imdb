I recently saw it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. The film title and in fact much of the film is from Robert Graves' poem Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk directs the script of Petr Jrchovský from the story of Hrebejk and Jrchovský. The story begins in 2002, when Prague hit one of the devastating 100 years of floods that destroy the household of Marcela (Ana Ceisler) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children Cuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michael Mrvikov). Because of the moldy conditions they now live in, Cuba is a life-threatening asthma. Marcela works, and Jarda runs a chop shop in the garage where she lives. Jarda's shady occupation leads him in violation of the law, and one of his theft victims becomes hateful of Marcela. Evzen Beneš (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers care to Marcelová and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcelly, who lives with her husband with the legal name Uncle Richie, who plays Jiří Schmitzer probably in the best role of the film. The rounding of this excellent cast is Emilia Vasaryova as the mentally fragile mother of Jarda, who gives money to the local religious charlatan. There is a lot going on here for a little movie and it's a good story with a great script and lots of comic relief. Aleš Březina provides a musical score to other music of Czech singer Raduzy and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There's a lot to like about this movie and I'd give it 8.0 out of 10 and I recommend it.
