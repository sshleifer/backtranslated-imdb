It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing a little more than a little. And I think her comedy talent can only be truly understood once the Haydn sonata or Debussy's song has made it through and succeeds. Her instrument is her voice and her handling is a pure musician. She could handle any part. All she couldn't do was do no success. This film is a perfect example. In it, she feeds Ruth Gordon (because the game is a thing) is feminine, charming, deliberate and self-effacing, generous, protective and combat, but never pretentious. She can remain credible because Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he envisages with a sharp edge. The viewer believes in and sees what they see. It is refreshing to see a movie that's both fun and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that Dunne will make him one day on the DVD all day because it's really hard to keep a secret as such in just a few initiators.
