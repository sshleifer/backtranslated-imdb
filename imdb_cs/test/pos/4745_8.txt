A compact criminal drama with a good amount of action. Unique NYC location footage adds to this heavy little movie. Technically well done with good direction and acting. Needless to say, the wild car chase, which seems to start in the city center, extends across the upper west side, Washington Heights, across George Washington Bridge and into the NJ must be one of the best ever on the film. for me it is better with time.8 of 10 ... easy
