"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies EVER !!! I think I saw this movie a few years ago on TV with my mother when I was little and I thought it was funny. This film was also referred to as "Black American Graffiti". Glynn Turman is amazing because Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs are great as a friend of Preach Cochis. There are some other great characters in it as well, and this movie has a lot of humor wrapped up in it. From the beginning of the film, where Cochise goes to Preach's home to prepare for school for the sad end of Cochis's funeral, this film is the one that will make you laugh all the way. There are lots of scenes in this movie that I love. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach and Cochise's friends) go to the zoo with them and gets a gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt (very rough but also funny), the first scene in the street corner of the cafe, a quarter party in this girl's house that has become disaster because of the fight, and some others are amazing to watch. This movie even has an amazing album of soundtrack that is packed with lots of beautiful Motown hits and artists since the early 1960s (in the year 75, only 6 songs were made on the soundtrack while others were in the 1960s). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of getting away from their impoverished and harsh neighborhood after high school, but their future seems almost out of reach because of their innocent joyful ride in a stolen car for which others were responsible two hoods, the relationship of Preache with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis), is almost at risk. Go out and rent this movie and be ready for a lot of comic fun !!! Also get a soundtrack. It's a lot of fun !!!
