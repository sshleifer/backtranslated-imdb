This is a wonderful gem of the film, unfortunately pigeon holed like "just for kids." The plot revolves around the young man Roy Eberhardt, who has recently arrived in southwestern Florida from Montana mountains. Roy tries to fit in with other children in his high school and finds that his sister sister team is trying to protect the endangered nesting owls on the illegal building. Look at Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil boss at the company's headquarters. Writer / director Wil Shriner is also an official of the Public Records Office, where the intrepid teen-detective finds out that there is no environmental impact report. Luke Wilson almost steals all the important scenes from charming teen actors who have most of the best lines. Wilson is a police officer in his three-wheel electric trolley with blue light and a funky siren. As Officer Dave tries to do so well, but usually ends up falling into the mud, literally! Several times! Jimmy Buffet is low enough as a quiet science support teacher. But young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Beatrice the Bear (Brie Larson) and Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) are great as teenagers who finally put Officer Dave on the right track, following a paper trail left by a bad corporate boss. . I hope you will feel as good from this movie as I did. Just fun! One small complaint. I hope that all non-Floridians realize that not everyone in Florida is so sure newbies, as stated in this movie. We are a really friendly bunch! Ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
