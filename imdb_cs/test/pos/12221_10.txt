I bought Surface all season. watched it in 3 days! I was so captured by the plot, the theories, and basically everything about the show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile's sister, mother and father acted as a real life family. You can join so many levels that it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I find animals so beautiful that you can almost connect with them as a parent is a child. It would be something if the creation of this kind of nature really existed. I'm sad that Surface doesn't have a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully they may create more or maybe in the book. <br /> <br /> I love the show too much. For those who have not observed Surface, if you like science fiction, you have to watch it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
