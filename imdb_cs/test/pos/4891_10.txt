As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to see this movie when it was released on DVD, but it was worth it that it was (unbearable) waiting. "Apocalypse" is fantastic - funny, strange, clever as hell, full of jokes and mysterious links to TV series; basically everything you would expect from the masters. The story has already been discussed in other reviews, so I won't bother overlapping it, even if I said it for the first time, I was a little hesitant. Apparently, this device - a fictional character entering the real world - confronts its creators - was used earlier, especially in the underrated books by Wes Craven "New Nightmare" and "The Dark Tower" by Stephen King (where the king himself was a character). However, gentlemen enjoy breaking the fourth wall and even adding a new element: the second fictional world ("their days"). Soon, all three facts came together and the result is exciting: Geoff Tipps is a knight in the Middle Ages (and tries to judge Queen Victoria Wood); The Real League of Lords in Royston Vasey, are confronted by characters like Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner called out a homunculus outside Bernice's church. I've heard that some people hate the "King's Evil" sub-plot, but I found it a cheerful, especially Reece character (who seemed to be a Judith "Witch" channel of three). Speaking of characters, I was relieved to find that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp were firmly embedded in the core of the film, other, more familiar figures were given to them. Bernice's confessional was cheerful at the beginning, she heard back to the faster, more sketchy first-line feel. Pauline and Mickey have portraits (not strange Ross), though I'd like to see more Mrs. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is charged as well as Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, giving their humble screen time almost a magical feeling (and what HELL did Papa hack up like an obscene hairball? According to a DVD comment, "a clump of greasy pubic hair"). /> <br /> The film looks incredible, but what's new? Music, as always, is breathtaking. I was thrilled to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of thematic music and his modest overhaul of a majestic, beautiful piece that closes both the "Apocalypse" and the last episode of Series Three. I had some minor complaints - it would be nice to see a more old, well-known Royston Vasey, and I felt that stop-motion was a bit unused. However, both of these problems can be justified by the film's budget, so they are understandable. Yet, as I loved Bernice's new church, it would be great to see the last battle on the high street (the original vision of gentlemen, according to comment). Overall, "Apocalypse" is overwhelming, especially if you're a fan of the series. I can't recommend it. 10/10.
