This film is ageless and apparently would appeal to children today, even though the Jedi is not the case. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is also great. Even Mickey Rooney is good; as well as Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was a different place when this movie was released, and it's definitely a great place to visit.
