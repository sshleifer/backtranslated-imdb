At this point I came across looking for a video or DVD of Porgy and Bess from 1959 with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If someone finds it in the home movie format, please let me know. All the while, I talk to my daughters about things they think are new, which have actually been done. A few years ago we went to see the live theater version and all I could talk about was this movie. Sadly, my daughters don't remember Sammy Davis Jr.. even when they heard about it. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other great actors in the film. This is the main surveillance that this classic movie (because of the cast) of the home movie format for collectors and for future generations. Anyway, in my opinion, this version was the best!
