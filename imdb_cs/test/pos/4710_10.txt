A fresh cinematography, beautifully written and edited, John Boorman's Beyond Rangoon is a must-see to anyone interested in world politics and the arc of personal transformation. They reveal a personal and political story that keeps haunting me and often measures my eyes. The story of the story is graspable, and the inner and outer paths are parallel carefully and gently in kinematics in the story. I watched this movie at least six times, and it really supervises. This is particularly important today, due to world events. Look at it, you won't regret it! BTW, NetFlix still carry, but you can ask to do it.
