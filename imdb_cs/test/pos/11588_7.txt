SEA INSIDE film by Alejandro Amenabar. Almod√≥var has always given the flag to Spanish cinema for years, Amenabar has come out of the blue to discover genres and inject new blood into the otherwise dysfunctional Spanish industry, now in large-scale gambling from psychological terror to social drama, the big ones would were, are viewers ready to take a swing and more important can have a flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedr, a sailor who was, at the age of twenty, paralyzed from the neck down in a sea accident and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has traces of afternoon melodrama TV and the only way it will work is through words and an honest performance and both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-authorize that the audience is not meant to be blind at the end of death, but are encouraged to invent their own mind in this process and that is a great move, it's not a movie professional. death, but a film in favor of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are a few laughs that are long, like when the church returns home in a wheelchair to break up Sampedro's beliefs, but it's usually a valley of tears that happens from all queues, even if you think you're safe for your father. to this point made no sense coming up with the most moving lines of the whole movie. Is it a cordial experience, especially when Sampedro seems to be fuller of life than most people wandering through the streets and everyone around him trying to convince him of the wonders of life and those who help him die? but when you get rid of the man of his dreams? The film is almost exclusively based on narrow shots, which brings a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic to Sampedro. This is a huge challenge for the actor, who has to build her entire performance with her eyes and her eyes are not lying. Bardem was not awarded his second Oscar nomination, probably to Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could shade Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in KILL AND MOCKINGBIRD, where acting seemed effortless and I count on Bardem reaching this state, where the line of what is and what is real is completely blurred. I never liked his early work, but since Alvesovar's LIVE FLESH is on the roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, DANCER UPSTAIRS and Oscar nominated NIGHT FALLS made him an international star, and while he and Banderas come from the same Almodov background it is fascinating See how different paths and how Bardem has become a real reference point for Spanish cinema around the world. Golden Globe, 14 Goyas, jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar courtesy of CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar drives, co-write, edit and give music to a high-caliber drama, he pulled it out? what about science fiction now? Whose life is it? ****.
