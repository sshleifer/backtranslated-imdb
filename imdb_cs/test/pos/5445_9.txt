I totally disagree with other comments! I also saw this movie at an early screening and found it quite pleasant. Robin Williams is in top form. True, the tone is known, but it's Williams of Good Morning Vietnam: smart, witty, on-site. After too many dark corners, Williams is finally back to doing what he does best. Supporting actors give great performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays as usual, but as an "agent" for the next president he was always happy on screen. Lewis Black only plays basically, but is well used here. There is also a fun turn for Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than what the trailer suggests. The movie is funny, but it's not a purely comedy, as it was suggested. He has a little thriller line that everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
