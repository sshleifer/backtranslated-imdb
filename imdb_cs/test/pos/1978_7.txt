Now that I was a sci fi fan, the movie's trailer looked a bit too, how do I put it, Hollywood. But after watching it, I can gladly say that I was amazed. Jude is a class actor, and Miss Leigh pulls him out better than Delores Clairborne. It brings movies like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not sound so appealing, but it's really one of the best movies I've ever seen.
