The population, to organize the defense of Novgorod and the lands of Russia, calls Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who defeated Swedish in the previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans, after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 due to the German threat to Russia, in the pre-World War II period. The idea was to create propaganda for Russia. But it is a stunning, amazing, overwhelming powerful work. It's an amazing battle scene on a frozen lake. The current generation is very accustomed to special effects, such as the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and may not understand how fantastic this black and white fight is. If the viewer can forget about the ideology and look at it as art, he will surely be surprised by such a masterpiece. My voice is ten. Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
