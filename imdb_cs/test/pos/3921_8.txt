Before I saw the House of Waxes, I assumed it would just be the second low-quality teenager to follow in The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After catching an advanced performance on my college campus, I can honestly say that people at Dark Castle did a great job of doing the slasher. From the usual staples of a teenage horror movie, such as a small group of friends leaving for a trip, they came across a special detour that ran through the country's back roads. slow but mandatory back-story this movie really reaches a fast clip. Paris Hilton appears in this movie, as many already know, but I really have to give it for her performance. Her performances aren't worth the Oscar, but the filmmakers use their looks to the full by pushing out the shameless satire, let's say, the less exalted media look of the film. Ms. Hilton also claims the title for the greatest scene of death in the film, and not just because it was her death scene. This movie is full to the brim with nervous moments and cheap scares, but Jaume Serra has definitely created a quality tension and tension between the characters. The causes of horror are partly based on the fact that viewers care about the characters we do. By making the usual buildup follows loud noise and choppy cameras some other frightening moments. These standard movie techniques taken from many of the past films are almost perfect with this film, and provide many good scares. In fact, there is no slow moment after they reach the small town where the Wax Museum House is dreaded. This movie owes much to many previous films of this and other genres, although I'm not sure how much it comes from the original 1953 movie of the same title. Links to such movies as Texas Massey Massey Massey, Saw, and even Titanic (see Paris Hilton's big scene of death and you'll know what I mean) are common, but at the end of the reward will leave you afraid and met if You are looking for a good fear with a few laughs. Not bad.
