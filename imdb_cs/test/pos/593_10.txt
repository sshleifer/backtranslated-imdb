Who doesn't remember Muppet movie ??? Kermit Frog is now an American culture icon. What child does this character dislike? As the first real Muppet movie, the movie simply called The Muppet Movie did very well. Kermit takes the advice of a Hollywood agent and leaves the home swamp to respond to the ad. On the way, she meets a pig, a bear, a chick and a rock band and several other quality puppets. Watch for dozens of portraits like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and a few others. I grew up and watched this movie and loved it.
