The strange ray of light penetrates into the bedroom. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) when they love each other. Approximately two hours are unanswered because they seem unharmed. Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse) Craig discovers that his wife has been impregnated with aliens. Sherry rejects this concept as absurd and is very happy to be able to pass on the news to her husband that she is really pregnant. Explicit after their attempt to conceive for ages, Sherry is afraid of Craig's persistence of a fetus who is not his ... that stems from controlling his low sperm count with a particularly high rate that he could by no means impregnate his wife. An embarrassing, disturbing fetal experience leads Sherry to some scary discoveries .. doctor, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) discovers that ultrasound gives some unusual newborn appearance, but it's Craig who notices that she resembles an alien! Sparks ignite electrical equipment, even shut down Wetherly's pacemaker! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but Lamarche believes her problem is psychological not physiological. With no one who doesn't believe his wife is an extraterrestrial impregnation theory, Craig turns to the sociologist Dr. But Bert is reluctant to help Craig go to the end of the country to save his wife from possible damage. Tragic results appear when Lamarche and others try to keep Craig out of his "cut-off" goals because he believes he's insane. Craig will continue to strive to bring Bert down with him. Grim, an absorbing horror story about one man's struggle to save his wife from being harmed, no one else knows it exists. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a scaly, but an intelligent doctor who wants to know more, but his pursuit of the truth of foreigners is not hostile. soccer goal. The story is narrated realistically. It's easy to see why others might consider Craig as their rocker. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses fear of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these enemies and prove to others that he is not a nut? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of demanding bearable scenes, where her unhappy character is naked on this table, who tries and harasses these things. Crouse is cool in a limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients look psychologically out of control. Monster effects are icky and effective. I think the film works pretty well, and director Yuzna deserves credit for staying at least for this film. For the last twenty minutes, when Craig attempts to perform his "removal operation" with a frightened Bert, who watches the crazy situation grow, is nail biting. You know, "Fire in the Sky" fans could kick this flick.
