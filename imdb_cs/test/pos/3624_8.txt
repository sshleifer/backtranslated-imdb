I hope to see from my place on the comedy throne of Heaven Spike Milligan and enjoy the movie, because Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken the book that the author himself wrote that "almost angered me" to watch. The film tells the story of the Irish city of Puckoon and the problems that occurred when it split up the area between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which passes through the center of the village and more. disturbingly, in the middle of the cemetery. This causes some deceased, buried in the Catholic Cemetery, now to be in Protest North - and thus a local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, wants to move bodies back secretly to darkness, and thus avoid bureaucratic British. border guards. Work was inspired by the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes attending Madigan. He brings innocence to the work, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he communicates with Richard Attenborough's voice, playing allegedly writer / film director). Daragh O'Malley playing Father Rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from home names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people who would normally be called "bit parts" - such as Spike Jane's daughter, who plays Madigan's wife, gives 100% credit for it, no small part to the wonderful characteristics Spike has mentioned in the original book. I could argue that the film is a bit too long, or that the Irish accent to Elliott Gould remained little desirable, but that would be just a few points and take nothing of the excellence of the film.
