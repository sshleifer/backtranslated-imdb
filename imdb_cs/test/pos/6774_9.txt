GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How do Danes with these films, which are always funny, sharply written, beautifully filmed and filled with great performances? GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark and ominously funny comedy, in many ways the Danish counterpart EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more to offer than just laughter or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings us the duo of the chronic pot Bjarne (Nikolai Lie Kaas) and the chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of their evil boss, two friends decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially the shop is slow and customers stay on. When an electrician is mistakenly locked and freezes in his meat cabinet, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh to fillets, which he immediately nicknamed "chickie-wickies". This special meal suddenly has everyone in the city swaying to their counter and Svend - unable to resist this sudden jump in popularity - turns into a serial killer with Bjarne, who acts as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, headed by his former boss, many people in the city are wondering what special ingredients two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performance of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film would not grow. above the average black comedy. On paper, the character Svend might border the cartoon, but Mads Mikkelsen's portrait is that of a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him scary, funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role, also playing his comatose twin Eigil. While watching the movie, I didn't even realize it was the same actor. Other performances are just as beautiful with every character in the city refreshing off-the-hook with some really beautiful vignettes. <br /> <br /> The material of the item is - naturally - a bit morbid and the material may not be completely fresh. with regard to several predecessors who have dealt with the same kind of material, but director Jensen gives him a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo Svend and Bjarne, with this amazingly bizarre story of two social misfits.
