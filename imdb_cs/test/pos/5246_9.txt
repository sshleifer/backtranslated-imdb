John Wayne's first major role fired me. Television letter style on the AMC, I had to check and make sure I got the right date. This 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen. Besides, it contains some of the funniest, most realistic shots of the trek to the west that I have seen. Freight wagons, men and animals are really lowered down the rock wall by a rope. Trees are chopped by stout men - and hefty women - so the train can move for another 10 feet. Indians are not "handsome boy" city gliders who portrayed them later; they are real agreements. Crossing the river in a driving storm is so realistic, it must be real (in fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost the entire cast in this succession). I felt a wet cloth. There is pain every day. Various sub-lands are forgotten, but the film as a whole is not. I can't think of another title that could beat The Big Trail in evoking life history on the route to Oregon. Bravo.
