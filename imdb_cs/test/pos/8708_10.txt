This is the perfect example of the classic Full Moon Pictures. Every Horror / Vampire Flicks fan should definitely check this out. Original Fence and good, easy to follow story. Also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine Horror with action. From now on, the only continuation I have seen on this film is Part IV, which I must say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should look at the Puppet Master, a group massacre, hot live, sleep camps and more in in full swing.
