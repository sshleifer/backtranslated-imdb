Starewicz is infinitely inventive, and his techniques still stun animation fans 70 years later. We can now have computer-generated techniques, but in 1934 he had only imagination that wouldn't mean "no" to the answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen he created. And he wanted to see some truly bizarre things - every imaginable piece of waste would call in: old shoes, chicken bones, dishes, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats .... what would be out of bounds. A really frightening, even disturbing movie that should be seen by anyone interested in animation. This movie has to be seen to be believed!
