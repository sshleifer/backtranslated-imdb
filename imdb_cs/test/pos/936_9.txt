This is Krzysztof Kieslowski's latest film - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. After this film, he intended to retire, so in a way it's his artistic testament. He died a few years after making the film, and although he says he wants to go back to direction, Destiny decided it was his last. And what movie! 'Rouge' The Last Movie in Three Colors The French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. In Geneva, one of the two main characters is a retired Swiss judge and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind. However, in a cold atmosphere, Switzerland is in a lack of character communication in a courtesy that covers the cruelty of life. Several characters who start with a small relationship end up at the end of the moving and human finale, which only a great artist could present. There are few others to say about what has not been said and written one hundred. times. Yes, the film begins slowly and fans of American style action movies or melodrama will bounce first and get lost as spectators. They deserve it. The film gains quality as it progresses, and one not so hidden message is that real life and real people are more interesting than Hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, the picture is "Study in red", as the name suggests. Acting is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - later on in what remains the best role of his old age. <br /> <br /> Great movie. I see that he adds it again, and I'm glad I recorded it on tape. 9/10 on my personal level.
