S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this moving and lively look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under Nanny's tutelage. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in realistic fashion as opposed to so many memories made in film. The support cast adds many sparks and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. It loses some steam and vibration to the end, and the ending sequence leaves a bitter feeling. But overall a great movie with a truly outstanding performance by Merkerson.
