What starts as a comedy-drama home and then halfway into a melodrama made John Garfield the star - and fairly. However, Jeffrey Lynn must not be released as an object of affection for four daughters. Lynn is very pretty and so charming that it is easy to believe that all four daughters might fall for him. Although Garfield received most of the kudos, Lynn became chief executive man at Warner Bros as a result of this film. Michael Curtiz insisted on placing a shoot for the picnic scene, making it the pinnacle of the top movie. Throughout, craftsmanship is enough to inspire respect. Fanny Hurst's soap opera has been transformed into a cinema masterpiece.
