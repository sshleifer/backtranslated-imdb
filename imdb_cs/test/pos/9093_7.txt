The basic assumption of Flatliners is quite simple. Several medical students found themselves in the place of death to find out exactly what the brain is doing. It sounds like something a crowd of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some very scary warehouses. In today's world where Hollywood has to enjoy foreign markets for ideas on how to make a horror movie, Flatliners is one of those precious gems that show that Hollywood can do something different when it tries hard enough. What divides Flatliners from many of the films based on this assumption that would come out today is that it does not bend to being condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to movies to be fun, not moral. In this kind of supernatural thriller, the difference this limitation makes is truly incredible. Even more unbelievably, Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or proves she can only play Julie Roberts. The theory of darkness that performers perform their best work with the smallest audience is in effect here. Subplots regarding what characters find during their loss of almost everything that makes them alive, and how they return to their present times, is surprisingly good. Particularly interesting are the moments when William Baldwin's character discovers that his personal video collection is returning to fear. That William Baldwin looks so perfect in the role, he says a lot about the script or the direction. I'm not sure which one. On the other hand, Kiefer Sutherland really shines like lead. One really feels like a secret to what the past experience is penetrating into the present and why it unfolds. As Kevin Bacon's character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the film is about. We can try to change the past as much as we do, but it's what we do with the present, that matters most. Another good aspect of Flatliners is how it reaches the atmosphere without the use of expensive, complicated visual effects. What is essentially horror is unusual for the Flatliners not to spend their budget where it did not have to. Much of what we see during more surrealistic sequences is the case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or footage. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there's a problem with the movie, it's about ten minutes too short. The end seems more perfect than convincing, as if someone in the studio had asked the director to pack the film so that they could be put on the market at some point in time. Of course, many films were left with painful spots for this reason, so Flatliners might not really be different. One hundred and fifteen minutes we get is very satisfying, though not very brilliant. I gave the Flatliners seven out of ten. It works well as a data movie or some late night movie. That aside, it's a good reminder that low-budget horror shows weren't always sad bits of garbage.
