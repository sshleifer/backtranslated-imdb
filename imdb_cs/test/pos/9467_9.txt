This movie is a great movie, however it is how most of the movie is highly predictable. The greatest highlight of the film, of course, is the stellar character Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely amazing and cheerful. She is one of the few people in this world who can use all the 53 muscles in her face to make the strangest and most detailed faces they've ever done. It's good for kids, and includes upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. All in all, they did a good job of updating the old classics, and they deserve a rest at the movie stand along with O and 10 things I hate about you. Other actors are also doing a great job in many of their first debuts.
