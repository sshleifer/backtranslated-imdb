Going into this movie I knew two things about him. I knew it was really an extreme swing, and I knew it was a bit artsy. Both appeal to me in their own right, but when placed together it can be something really unique. And that was damn right, no doubt unique. As I said above, it's a artsy film. The way they used some intense sound reminded me of a lot of Aaronian film. I didn't see anything like that visually. Cinematography and lighting went very well. The film uses the visuals and sounds more seriously than I have seen in a while. Especially when you take into account the experience these young filmmakers (twenty years old) have, you really have to take a hat with them. The film is not easy to describe or discuss. There is no real story, could you say that it revolves around the right and left sides of the brain and how do they control your life? These are four segments, or four thoughts that have revived visual and auditory extremes. There is some talk to hear and there, but it's mostly a non-talking movie. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and spins naked body and eyeballs. Try and guess what happens. The second segment is my favorite. This is a brother and sister (who looks a bit like Sarah Silverman but with bigger breasts). Brother is crazy and sister is somewhat bitch. I would say it is the most extreme of all segments and the most interesting. The gore effects in this one were great. The third segment revolves around a pile of naked people who get it with their mother country. It's probably considered the weakest of the game, but it's still clever and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest of the movie and I would also say the deepest. For myself, I'll have to look at it a few times to understand what's really said. Do I know that Christianity solves it in a way that would most likely cause your mother to pretend or vomit? Try it. Subconscious cruelty was recommended to me and I am proud to say it is now in my film collection. It's extreme, violent, bloody, very sexual and surprisingly pretty damned thoughts provoking. The next line I'm going to say was used in almost every review I read for this movie. "This movie isn't for everyone." Now that's not true. If you're in extreme movies and / or are you just a movie lover who wants to see something else? 8 1/2 outta 10
