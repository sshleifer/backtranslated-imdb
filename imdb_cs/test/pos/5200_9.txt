Bloody awesome. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the story - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valor through shock, fear, disintegration, despair and total destruction. First-class anti-war film that had to provoke a stir in Germany. It is not a proud moment for anyone and a study of a lost generation. This film was excellent in taking the command from the ground troops and struggling with the utter futility of trying to control the untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I didn't know I thought it was a Russian film, it was so fatalistic. This is an uncompromising end. Piety.
