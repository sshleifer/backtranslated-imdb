I love this movie! I know some people may say it wasn't a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors have been greatly selected. That was my first exposure to Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle and what made their first impression. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood. He has great comedic timing and correct access to this type of film. Apparently, Dave Chappelle is much bigger now, but at that time he was his first film and did a great job like Achoo. The characters were very well planned and they all added their own little jokes to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
