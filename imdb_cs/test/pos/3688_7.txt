I'm a huge fan of Rupert Everett. I love Kathy Bates, so when I saw her available, I decided to check it out. Synopsis didn't tell you much. In parts it was stupid, touching, and in others some parts were hysterical on the right. <br /> <br /> Any person who is a big fan of any type of personality will find some small identifying features with the main character. (Of course, there are many that will not, but that is the point) <br /> <br /> If you like any of the actors to give it a watch, but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun. I could also mention how you see how Rupert is tall. I think I knew it was 6'4 ", but it seems to be even more in this movie. It even seemed to have collapsed a little because of the height of the other characters in this one. And for you Rupert fans is a bare chest scene ... WONDERFUL!
