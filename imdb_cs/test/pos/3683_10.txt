Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's an emotional path. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace he doesn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When an old woman holds a glass and says, "In memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub is followed by a suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of Kathy Bates' best roles. Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene he is in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work at Unconditional as Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another hysterical fit. On this day and the age of Gay rights is questioned, I think this film should be seen by all. As a gay man in my late 40s, I saw people lose everything when a loved one dies. So kudo is for everyone involved in making this movie.
