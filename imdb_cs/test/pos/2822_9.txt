I'm surprised by some comments on this site because I really liked this movie. If you're looking for something else, then this movie is a good choice. Certainly not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere playing Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, in fact, attention needs to be paid to some people being turned off. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your feet, then this is a good choice. Warning for Parents - It has some pretty graphical sex scenes, so watch as soon as the kids are in bed. People who like the euro will like it. Adam Sandler fans should skip because it will be over their heads and certainly not their style.
