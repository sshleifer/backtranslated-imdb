As an adult, I am grateful that I have captured this film by accident when I was a teenager. I have experienced family problems over time. This particular film was able to capture what I saw from the wardrobe world. How much pressure is too much? Actually, I had to buy this movie because it got me to the level, unlike most movies trying to reach the audience. How far can an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teenagers try to find answers to these questions, but in the end ... who is the "package leader" if they have to be one? Is it strong? Beautifully? Maybe the person we all chose seems to be? Could it be a moral character? As for the film, the cast worked together as if it were destined. I just hope that more directors and producers are trying to create a work that will appeal to all of us, like this particular film. I wish I could vote more than ten because this particular title deserves much more.
