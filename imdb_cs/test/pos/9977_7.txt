When I first saw that the movie is being advertised I thought it would be another Disney movie that almost goes straight into the video. Finally I got and rented. I thought it would be bad because I couldn't see Shiite in any other role than his recently canceled "Even Stevens" show. When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off boredom in about ten minutes. It started a little slower and I couldn't understand the beginning because years didn't make sense, then explained that later in the show so I was relieved thinking about it. Everything and everything I thought it was a good movie and would recommend it. The cast was excellent and although I am not a fan of golf, I easily kept my attention with a good plot.
