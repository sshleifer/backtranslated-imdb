The slightly prolonged episode of the previous week paid off in uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. The distinction of the cliffhanger was marked by a certain deus ex machina of flavor, but for all this it was a good start. As is now common with this physician, the moral, ethical, and emotional reflections on his actions have been in focus. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue to be covered when the doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even excuses cybernet during battle! This episode eventually shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that was hinted at in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete and was absolutely convincing. With the scary, humor and scenes that brought a cough to the neck, this episode had everything. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series embodies the classic series in every respect. When it comes from hard Whovian, you can't get better recommendations.
