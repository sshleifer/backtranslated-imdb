I got a chance to see this movie at an early screening in Brea and since then I've been crazy about it. The film is based on Shakespeare's 12th Night, which I read and loved and saw on stage several times so I liked the links. Whether you like Shakespeare or not, it doesn't matter - the film is on it. It's super funny, funny and charming. Amanda Bynes is cheerful and David Cross. Actually, the whole cast is great - I'm just a huge fanatic of David Cross. The cast is hot and the soundtrack is kicking a lot of great bands and a couple I haven't heard before, but I know they have a CD, so I'll buy it. Everyone in our audience laughed from start to finish - all ages. !!!!
