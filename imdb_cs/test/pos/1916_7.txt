This is definitely one of the most important cult classics and all psychotronic fans need to be seen. Why? He has everything he should have a great 70's movie. Included are dialogues, misconduct, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political misconduct, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic. In other words, Dolemite needs to be seen. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, the plot doesn't make sense. What I took from this is that the pimp-hustler Dolemite got a frame that stole fur and narcotics for half a million dollars. While he made time, his arch nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his night club. However, the compassionate guard (the only white character in the entire movie who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to be able to stop him in order to stop Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung fu as well as about 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie. And even more happily when he was locked up, Ms. Queen Bee sent all her hoes to the kung fu school. With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. However, two racist white cops are trying to rebuild him and let him throw him back in jail. <br /> <br /> As I said before, don't try to watch the storyline. I have seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connection with anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. I'm still trying to figure out what was with Mayor Reverend Gibbs and Pimp Hamburger. Who is ultimately interested? Scenes with these characters are invaluable. As far as dialogue is concerned, it is terrible with even worse birth. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I wonder if this movie was supposed to be a spoof or serious action film. It seems he couldn't decide which one of them. Lines like "Yeah, I'm so bad, I'll kick my own ass twice a day" call for further investigation. Either way, the film is cheerful, and the plot has more holes than the Swiss cheese factory. Another cheerful feature is some of the most novel uses of sex and nudity in the movie. Actors you would never want naked naked (including mayor and queen bee). Not to mention that the microphone boom appears in every other scene. Above all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to have a good time in general and is certainly charismatic. His rape comedy has proven to be a tremendous influence on the second day of gangsta rap, including Dr. Dre who sampled him on his pioneering 1992 album "Chronic". How technically impossible is a film to be culturally influential. More importantly, it's all around. The biggest crime that a film about exploitation can make is boring, and it changes and enjoys fast for all its shortcomings. In other words, if you dig this kind of movie, you will love "Dolemite". If you don't kick it, you're "no-business, born-uncertain, jock-jawed motha-f *** and!" (7/10)
