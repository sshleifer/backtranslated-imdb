This is a great movie. When two people from different backgrounds and social status think they have nothing to offer, and finally what others need is proof of what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why there is a man with a woman or a verse versa, and external circumstances tell us one thing, but what they offer each other out of what we see is amazing and inexplicable. When Nimi thought Matthew had nothing to offer her, and when Matthew was just looking for a flirt (because he had an open marriage to Jenny's wife), they eventually realized they couldn't and do not want to exist without another. It is worth defending them what family and friends thought and what society said it was right to be with each other. This film renews my faith in love.
