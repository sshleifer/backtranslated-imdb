I enjoy the National Anthem. I like the National Anthem, if I imagine I play cymbals in the band for nothing more than Midnight News. It's not as easy as you think! One two three four; One two three four; But what then? So I have a sympathy with the bass drummer in the beautiful Roy Andersson movie, patiently waiting for his cue to listen to the 70's cassette player. <br /> <br /> The 70's theme seems to continue, with classic, mindless furniture . In addition, each scene has a moderate jade wash that emphasizes the minute nuances of the acting subtest. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the brilliant purple shoes of Jessica Lundberg. Shoes that would otherwise inspire the Silk Cult advertising campaign. But then it's hard. Someone asked me what's going on. Well there is a scene where the opening line like "I don't have that length in green" Brilliant. Directly from Gary Larson's carton. I can't say what it is about. Go look. <br /> <br /> Plasma Ron <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Swedish Sounds <br /> <br /> (Showing 15Apr08)
