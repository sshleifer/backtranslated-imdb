The director's whole story tells the story of the imperial emperor's plan to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, the film wasn't blown away in terms of the actors' ability (which was good that I enjoyed the marquee the most) or its appearance (although the mass army was extremely impressive if it were a real person who is a lot of extras!). I've seen Li Gong in other movies and she's always great. I think a good time piece, but not one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and found 2 1/2+ hours is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 out of 10.
