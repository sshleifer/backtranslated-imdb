When taken as a whole for my thoughts and analysis of the current two-party system and the political process, I think it's a great movie. He made the movie wasn't a comedy I was expecting, but once I got through this movie I was really wondering. So much of what we see and hear about elections is such a joke. In particular, there is a debate scene in this film that I thought was a masterful critique of our political debates and how policies were "discussed". I encourage everyone who thinks our process is OK to go see this movie. But if you want to laugh, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual ones. In this film they show us that the truth hurts, not that it is true.
