I caught it on TV several times in the late 1970s. It only played late at night (around midnight). Peter Lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is disfigured in fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and filled with despair. She turns to the life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his disfigured features and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! She tries to go straight to her ... but she can't escape her life of crime or hatred of her own scarred face. No film B without budget. Very short (running just over an hour), but well done and well done by Lorre. This has a much greater depth than you would expect from a fast-paced B. Ankers image especially takes a thankless "girl" role and makes her character fresh and appealing. Unfortunately, this has disappeared from the TV and has never been uploaded to a video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM recently showed it and it was great to see that the film was still holding. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
