I saw Marigold on the preview a few days ago and found it to be a thoroughly funny and enjoyable movie. The film is about a not-so-successful American actress who goes to India to act in a low-budget movie just to find he's trapped there when she finds out that the film has disappeared, along with producers and investors. An accidental encounter with the Indian film making her leads her to be hired for a small dance role. Since Indian movies contain a lot of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left legs, not to mention the personality so tightly wound and thorny that he barely hears music, let alone feel like Prem, the choreographer of the film , advise her to do. But "prem" - a word, not a person - means "love", and Prem - a person, not a word - seems to embody this emotion in the way he deals all around him, be it they are their production assistant assistants who have taken Marigold into filming, narcissistic and arrogant filmmaking, or shabby and exciting Marigold. Soon, under expert guidance and persistent treatment, Marigold finds his feet - literally and figuratively. I have to say the word to those who are not familiar with the use of songs and dance in Indian movies. Unlike American musicals, the story progresses through these dance figures, as plot development develops and character transformations occur in parallel with dance. It should also be pointed out that Indian dance is a little more than just movement. An integral part is the enactment of dance feelings and emotions, as well as telling the story of the dance. This is the main purpose of dance and dancer. That Marigold reaches this level of success is demonstrated in an overwhelming dance number around the middle, when Marigold, while performing the dance she is required to do for film-in-film, also expresses her love for Prem. It is an amazing performance of Ali Larter, especially when we realize that he is not used to dancing in his films, nor is he dancing with his character's emotions. This shows her skill as an actress, as well as how much hard work she put into the role. Of course no romantic movie can work without a trusted Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays Prem, throws a role to T. Even if the Prince turns out to be so charming, he doesn't lose the audience's sympathy. Salman has been ruling the Hindu cinematography (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years, and it is worth recalling that Prem was also his first leading role. She is absolutely charming, sweet, adorable, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never met him on the screen, be prepared to be hit by mega doses of total magnetism! He and Ali Larter make a beautiful couple, and they are also in agreement in their acting as in their appearance. Can they solve their problems? It doesn't seem possible because we hear the last song of the movie, a beautiful blend of reality and fantasy, reality and metaphor. Certainly the audience has taken the end, which I saw with surprise but remained satisfied. Songs are used very cleverly. They are in Hindi, unsubtitled, for film-inside-film sequences, and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always clear from context and choreography. Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, that's a bit of humor. Indian locations and costumes give him a fabulous quality, suitable for a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or have been curious about an Indian cinema, but have hesitated to try it, this is an excellent introduction. It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films, not only in costumes and jewelry (which are quite impressive), but also in vibrant tones and world sound music. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ali Greater, you should watch her excellent acting in portraying a selfish, challenging, "high-maintenance" woman who still has an inner appeal that inspires the love of two men. If you're a girl, you'll enjoy admiring Ali's beautiful costumes and ogling her chief man. If you're a guy, you can not only admire Ali in her sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Chan what it means to make a loving heart come from someone who is like Margold.
