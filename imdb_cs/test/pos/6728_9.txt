This movie haunted me because I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn't know what it was called, so I'm so glad I finally watched it. I remember being quite scared because when I watched him, I was on a tin mine in Cornwall, so I could imagine. Fortunately, I saw no ghosts of dead children there, but I thought the movie was very disturbing and frightening when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, though I couldn't find it anywhere. It seems to me that I remember that the films of the Film Foundation for Children are generally good, but they do not show them at all. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe at the same time on the BBC - just as disturbing in a way.
