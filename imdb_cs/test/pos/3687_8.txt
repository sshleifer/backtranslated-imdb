Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has twenty-five years of marriage with lawyer Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who introduces a television show in Chicago and shows five spots on the first line of the TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins the ticket when Max asks for divorce at the same time, claiming that their lives are too monotonous. Grace becomes depressed, and when she goes on a show, the audience is informed that a Chicago serial killer who uses a crossbow has killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart he decides to fly to England for the funeral of Victor Fox. There he realizes that he is gay and becomes a friend of his former friend Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago trying to find a killer. This film is a wonderful, original and strange dramatic comedy with bizarre characters. It has a huge potential to be a cult film, with Julie Andrews present and Barry Manilow himself, and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece 'Don't Look Now' when Maudey wears a red cape in an underground Chicago area. . The beginning of the film, with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway', is gorgeous. I repeated it four times in a row. The cast has a spectacular performance, emphasizing Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. In fact, this film is an excellent pastime. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cupid and Toda Prova" ("Love of Evidence")
