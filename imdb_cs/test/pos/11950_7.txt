This is a follow-up creature to Better Off Dead. He will win a hand-down in Better Off Dead. But for stellar power, one Crazy Summer outshines Savage Steve is a better scenario. Problems with one crazy summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was cast much better. Friendship: OCS shows that Cusack gives a hateful look at Bill Murray's little brother. Problems on stage? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more true friends in BOD. The fence was good. You predict some of them, but predictable parts go further than you think. So even though he's the ugly half-sister of Dead's Dead, it's worth a look. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery if for no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it, just say it. If you don't like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't even like him, but you can't escape him. At least she does a great job in the film and pays tribute to another monster. The editing needed help on the beach, but for most of them, not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and funny. But try not to compare it with BOD or you'll miss it. *sigh*
