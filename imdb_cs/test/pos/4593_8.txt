First, let me say that while I generally appreciate the work of Mike Judge, I was only lukewarm in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead. In general, I prefer a more intelligent comedy, and that is the irony of Idiocation. In the future world, where the portrayal of Beavis and Butthead, the basic instincts and intellectual abilities of the framework of a messy, messy, semi-Mad Max semi-Blade Runner company where every trailer-trash guy is fantasy becomes Reality, a man with even average intelligence threatens and accuses of speaking gay, and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly fun. Yes, it is clear that Carl's Jr. executives, Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers will be appalled at the twisted values ​​of their products in 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missed opportunities with film, and the relationship between passengers time - others are average intelligence woman who is afraid of her boyfriend (pimp) retribution - could be stronger; Chemistry is there. And there aren't too many women in the future. I left with a smile on my face, but the experience is a little better than my memories. So, this is my kind of popcorn movie, and it will be fun to go back to the video. Recommended! FYI stay over credits for another scene.
