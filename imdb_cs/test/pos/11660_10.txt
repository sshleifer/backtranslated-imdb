One of the best. Direction, photography, thrilling and dramatic history, amazing soundtrack and above all the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated actor "under 40". After seeing this movie, I think there is someone who could have no doubt that he would give death to a man, despite the ugly things he could do?
