I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you who do not know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a Canadian film tour in Canada). I was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an American distribution store that added to my excitement. I'm a big fan of horror movies, and yes, I also love the Scream trilogy. So when I found out that Rose McGowan was doing the Little Indians movie, I knew I was about to treat myself. Rose McGowan was the greatest actor of the festival. The best way to describe it without too much of a conspiracy is that it's not like Scream. And it's definitely worth seeing. It is located in the middle of a snowstorm (it was shot in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) in a mountain motel that adds tension. Rose McGowan performs in great performance as "girl-next door" (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens at the end, well, all I say is that you never end up. Sadly, it probably won't get into the mainstream of North American theaters because Rose McGowan is the only decent money maker. But if you have a chance to see it, I suggest you do it. And if it's the worst, there's always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave him 9 out of 10.
