Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian animator living in France who did incredible things with stop-motion. I've seen a few of these movies before and they have their favorite items - insects, frogs, and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic and even today they are amazing to watch - the quality is just fantastic. This star is a lot of frogs. They call upon their god Jupiter to give them a king. Why do they need kings, wonders of Jupiter - their lives are now perfectly fine. In order to teach them an ugly lesson, he will make a heron a heron and start eating his subjects one by one! Then the frogs turn to Jupiter again, who says it's best to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is incredible, it's a very scary movie for kids. I would think it would frighten both how animals look and the story itself, which is not for the weak heart!
