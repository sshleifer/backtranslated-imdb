That was the movie that started that movie love affair <br /> between the crew of Jaundiced Eye and Matthew Ferguson. His ability to portray normal characters like Birkoff in "La Femme Nikita" is balanced by his equally agile <br /> <br /> manipulation of weird as "Kane." One wants more roles, bigger roles and more, even more complex tasks to be given just to <br /> <br /> to push the limits of their capabilities. There were four or five unforgettable scenes in this movie, and Matthew Ferguson stole two of them from much more experienced actors. This movie <br /> <br /> itself is good, and worth watching on its own merits, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes something special. His * ouevre * can finally show what was Anthony Perkins MIGHT's career <br /> <br /> was as if he wasn't posted as "Norman Bates" so long <br /> <br / >. "Kane" is not as excellent as Norman, and much less <br /> <br /> people have seen "Love and Human Remains than they saw" Psycho, so we can hope that Ferguson will show us a hint of what Perkins MIGHT <br /> <br /> was able to achieve if he was allowed.
