... and the reasons for which they are simple - there are so many great movies that are presented and discussed here (most of them own directors and stars), so many videos of the infamous moments in the history of the 1970s and in fact a number of films that I have not seen that it is not fair to evaluate this work. According to this logic, I should not give any signs to other film documents, such as Martin Scorsese's Personal Journey through American Films and My Voyage to Italy. But while these films were based on one person's view of cinema, telling most ways, Richard LaGravanese and (late) Ted Demmes' Decade Under Influence allows movies and creators to speak for themselves. What makes the "decade" at least one watch for film enthusiasts, or just anyone who likes movies from the late 1960s and 1970s in America, is the level that goes in the uncut version (three hours, not theatrical version, which I have no comments about) is covered a lot of space. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne etc. . Also fascinating is the way in which clips and directors / actors appear, edited together in flashy and quick style. One of the comments I have about the document is that most of the information presented has been reported in various books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I haven't seen the movie version of the book, but I'm sure that it is a lot of movies and directors and incidents as it is here (in fact, it is a book that is one of the best I've ever read. enthusiasts and occasional movie visitors to the future - can look at it and learn not only about well-known images like Easy Rider, Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, but also a landlord known as Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, Landlord, Joe, they shoot horses not they, they can also learn about who influenced them (New Waves of Europe and Asia), who they served as influences for and how the subject that created the controversy after the controversy still serves as an interesting.
