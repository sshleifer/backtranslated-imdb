* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I don't care what anyone says, this movie is merry. This is a sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a snowman killer. A snowman is created when a convicted serial killer to be executed is taken to an execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA binding with dirt or in this case snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on it. Or so they thought. This film takes place one year after another. Some scientists resurrected Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. There is no explanation for why they do it. Meanwhile, Sherrif, who arrested Frost in the first, goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman is with him. This movie has it all. He has a talking carrot that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you hold them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like children. I'll have to give the creators this credit. Snowballs are some of the most diverse little things they have ever dreamed of. I wish I could get him as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a snowman killer had the ability to influence the great weather. Then there are the actors. There's Manners, an FBI agent from the first movie, except he's wearing a watch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I AM THE FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's a stereotypical British adventurer and a stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. Finally, Captain Fun. The most fertile man on the planet's surface, no bar. This movie is not scary, but it is cheerful. I laughed at my ass from all the way and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> ***
