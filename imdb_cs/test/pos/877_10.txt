This movie was sold very well. When it was released in '97, halfway through the glory and success of Master P, something and everything with his name was sold on the shelves. That's why it's no wonder that this underground city drama has sold over 250,000 copies and is still going on. <br /> <br /> If you're a No Limit fan then you can see it. She has several old fatty at school and don't let me start with strange strippers at the bonus ice cream party. So what do I say to all people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records don't look at it because it's not for you and they don't bother to vote on it, because you just deter TRU from limiting fans from renting or buying this low voiced video .
