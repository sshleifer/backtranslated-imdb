I never paid much attention to this movie until I learned that screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky - the author of the brilliant "Network". His work taught me about his genius, so when the TMC appeared, I tried to see it. I wasn't disappointed. Looking at this film and the "Network", it seems that his big theme is the absurdity, innocence, and utter cruelty of large human businesses (eg Hospitals, Networks) against the sanctity of individual experience and human spirit. it comes with sharp black humor. "Hospital" is as black as the "Network" comedy, and the excellent cast, led by incomparable Scott, does its job with full justice. It's a breeder; definitely not missing.
