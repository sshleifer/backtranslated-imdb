I bought this movie for Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this movie when she played the role of Harry's girlfriend (Mike Wagner). Harry's robbery on his luck is trying to do one more robbery. Harry goes to the funeral to meet Vittorio De Sica and take him on the road. When things don't work on the ride, put there mines together to find out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittoria De Sica from there on the crowd. Stay confident no matter what gang goes after that, the result is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit. The rest of what's coming, you have to watch yourself. As for Raquel, if you are a fan here, then you have to watch this movie because it never looked better when standing on the beach with ******. I give this movie 10 weasel stars on Raquel Welch's body alone. No wonder why she was the warmest actress in the sixties. It was a sexual symbol that everyone wanted, and no one could get it. Not only does it look good, it can act even better. If you like it, Raquel Welch then you will enjoy this movie
