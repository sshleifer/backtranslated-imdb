Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to kill him and then bring him back to life to prove that there is an afterlife. So they do it and soon all medical students want to know if life is dead. Afterlife is not about pearl gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but a little more sinister. Past ghosts are returning to chase them, and this movie will surely be pursuing someone. She has several pretty frightening moments that could translate into real life, and people are somewhat interested in what happens when you die. It's a good movie to see when it rains and you feel down. It's also a little weird. <br /> <br /> Look at it with a scary past.
