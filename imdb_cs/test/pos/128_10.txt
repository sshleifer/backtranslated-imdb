It is worth a bath on a Hindu pantheon before looking at this film. The three main female deities - the wise Sita, educating Lakshmi and Kali transformer - as well as the three main male deities - the tomb of Rama, the playful Krishna and Shiva Ender - are all mentioned. The knowledge of folklore is surely every Indian member of the audience lending the story of the current wealth story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a spirituality lesson, and then in the film's "real life". "Fire" speaks against misogyny and homophobia in a society where its producers are native, and does so with a beauty that links the message to several levels of viewer consciousness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the best movie I've seen in the last ten years; highly recommended!
