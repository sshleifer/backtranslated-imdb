I saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago. Compared to the films made for the Lifetime movies that I have usually watched, he has become an immediate but unclear favorite. I've seen it twice since then. I think some parts are a bit cheesy, maybe the action could use some more action. However, it captures the imagination and reality of children with uniqueness and warmth. Magic realism is on the same level as Amelie, and the heart with The Wonder Years. Despite the particular evolution of my taste, I still find the subtle charms of this film, nice characters and its simplicity, charming.
