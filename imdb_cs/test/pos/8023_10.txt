Picture Scene: Boring Student with Blank Day Forward, Video Shop with Special Offer 5 Videos for Weekly Rentals. This ex-student usually just grabbed a pile of dubious videos for the most appropriate reasons (The Turnning Who?). An occasional undiscovered gem has occasionally made it into his video recorder - which is the case with this movie. Everything about film is good, but much more than all these parts that provide everything that is too rare - a cracked good movie. Why I have never received British cinema is beyond me, especially when we think of the bullshit we need to discuss in the week of multiplex in the week. Although we are happy to accept it, it is not an Oscar material (but Titanic - schmaltzy cgi-teded bollocks) is an extremely enjoyable movie. I was trying to figure out a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated - a perfect movie that you can watch when bonding with your dad, after returning home for the holidays, after a big Sunday lunch.
