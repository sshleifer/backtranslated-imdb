This film is one of the classics of cinema history. It wasn't to please a modern audience, so some people nowadays may think it's wrinkled or agile. I found it absorbing. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevsky, just as he did when he played Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terrible) a few years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was a bad soundtrack that was quite garbled. Although I know only a little Russian, it would be nice to be able to pick more words than they would have to rely on almost 100% for the headlines. I watched it on an old videotape from the library. Perhaps there is now a DVD version that has been improved. I would like to know if the actors used archaic Russian or even old Slavic when they talked. The headlines were strangely worded and it is hard for me to tell if it was to reflect the older way of speaking or whether the headlines were somewhat wrong.
