It's really pretty simple. The movie's name is a deathbed, a bed that eats. If you're like me, you already know if you like this movie. The next day I came across this gem at Best Buy and picked it up at ten Bucks. I got ten dollars for looking forward to the title, and the box itself. I'm a huge fan of B movies. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest B movies I've ever seen. Now it's not for everyone. It's true it's not even for most people. As a matter of fact, I suspect that there will be only a handful of us who really enjoy the film. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like B movies, this movie is Diamond. He's got a great premise, bed ... That's what people eat. He does not go, does not move, does not have a siren to attract people. It relies heavily on people wandering and sitting on it. I loved every inch of this movie and I've seen it three times in the last weeks I've owned. <br /> <Br /> As I said, after reading the movie title you already know if you like it. If you laugh or smile, do it. it's worth it.
