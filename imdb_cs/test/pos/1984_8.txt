WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's always abnormal films are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films are likely to be in the form of `eXistenZ ', but it's definitely not for the whimsical. All the usual elements are here. Game under from the skin (hooked to the back), buckets of blood, gun from the bones, and a manic mechanic to name just a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite excessive use? Weirdness that can prove that virtual reality games can have dangerous effects on some people. In the film, the character shoots someone dead claiming he was "unpleasant" (assuming she was still in the game). But he leaves the question of whether this has actually happened, or whether it was an event in this tremendous life play. `eXistenZ 'leads to a conclusion that can be answered in several ways. Despite some other gooks and gooks, it was simply your classic `was it all a dream? or it was twisting. It's a handy surprise and answers a few questions, but giving the whole movie up to this point is a little disappointing. It could have been a little longer in just 97 minutes. The film in a special way raises moral questions, but reacts to them in a violent and somewhat inappropriate way. Jennifer Jason Leigh appears in his first big role here. But her character doesn't have enough qualities to jump from the screen or even give it a nice character. Jude's law on the other hand (equipped with a curious American accent) is good because your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through its perspective. <br /> <br /> `eXistenZ 'is far from flawless, but it's definitely a cinematic experience you can remember. There are a lot of strange features that match similar styles of David Lynch (what's next? - consumes a question mark?!?!?!). It's definitely not for all tastes, but it's good enough to recommend it. My rating IMDb: 6.2 / 10.
