The timing of this film could not be better, especially in the light of all the unrest in today's world. The film is pleasing, cute and funny. If you have siblings and you still have parents alive, it will be well hit for the viewer. If you lost your parents, then you will be deeply touched. Laughs come often, file cast works very well and are believable. This film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors often make the viewer laugh. There are times that bring tears to your eyes. I would recommend this film to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can watch a smart movie.
