I liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so long until the cruelty of the animals of civilized people in Scotland appeared to me in the second half and made me so sad that I couldn't look at them. However, this was done by the filmmaker to make the point that early scientists destroyed everything alive they did not understand by "studying" it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the studied animals, which we know now should not be studied anywhere, but in natural the world they inhabit, and most unusually. I recommend this film because it was mostly a serious and honest story of Tarzan, who showed that it was a gross animal cruelty that developed in the scientific world of the 19th century as well as a clean and simple, beautifully primitive life that Tarzan lived as a young a man who was found as a child and raised by chimpanzees after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. Christopher Lambert was amazing and soulful in his life as Tarzan's role, just as Ralph Richardson in his latest film role as Tarzan is an ultra-rich, nobility-reeking gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was nice and pretty good, like Tarzan's curious and civilized "Jane" in his first film role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very scary eyes, I don't understand why Lambert did not become a big star later, but his really bad film choices later could make him. Amazing Ian Holm as a wounded Frenchman in Africa Pomohl Tarzan, who then escorted Tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in Scotland, was as great as ever. I am so glad that Tarzan fell ill and did not stay in a cruel animal the civilized world at the time and eventually went home to Africa to live his life with the gentle and affectionate apes "relatives" who raised him instead to stay in Scotland and live like royalty, which would destroy it if it wasn't. Kill him first.
