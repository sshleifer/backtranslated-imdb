Like most people outside, watching James Bond 007. Most people NEVER knew Thunderball was originally a FIRST 007 movie to be released, but Ian Fleming wrote a story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. Two other authors have taken Ian Fleming to court and WON THE CASE has provided evidence that ian fleming has taken over SPECTER (Special Executive In CounterIntelligence Terrorism Revolution Extortion). So rather than doing Thunderball they (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) went on to do dr no. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best, Since getting sean connery back again, it was paid over 5,000,000 for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the scene, that's true. But overall, this movie was where I think (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No), it's my favorite of the bond series. David Dryer was hired for special photo effects, he worked at that time on Bladerunner beFORE No he never said never again. A $ 100 million yacht makes a disco volante, looking like a canoe. This movie played the best Villian in bond movie just for dr. Klaus Maria Brandeau held this neurotic store together as a calm way, with a little joke to his authority over the bond. Barbara Carrera was excellent because of her reddish color. Music was better than any score that did not include John Barry, who in most bond movies makes background music. Michel Legrand is not big in the US compared to Europe, he has played with davis miles and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's a bit bland sometimes, but a 007 theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in a movie NEVER NEVER NEVER BE COOL, I like it more than the original. Timothy Dalton explained that I thought you could join SUPERMAN OR SUPERHERO, he or she must be human and have feelings. It was by far the best SERIOUS LEARNING VERSION OF BOND. But Sean Connery proves that he can still do a role that has led him and others to follow.
