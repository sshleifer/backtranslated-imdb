OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see a resume, check it out. This is an original, fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed with it complain because they do any other deviation of facts. Sad but true. I think Kane Hodder, the man in which the film is named, was a great idea. I thought it wasn't that good at first, I'll be honest. But it just scared. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think it's a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people), stay away from this movie and everyone else.
