I was absolutely surprised at how good this movie is, because when I first saw it, I was just slightly amused! However, I must say that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor did not get a bigger and better role! It was a huge talent. There is great chemistry among the main team members and Matthau has never been more fun. I am extremely pleased that this picture was created because we will see Lemmon and Matthau as they last meet; in a vehicle that places great emphasis on their talent. Brent Spiner proves that Star Trek's "Data" Geerace is not the only good character to play. The storyline is really very simple, but comedies and characters work really well and I laugh heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.
