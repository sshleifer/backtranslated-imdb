I first heard about Melancholia Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. He literally knocked out a big show with a big bad boast, condemned the garbage and confusing. Curiously, I decided to watch the show (as soon as I received the order of the episodes, thanks to those who wrote the lists), and I found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Big unforgettable characters that are full of life and are absolutely nice and cheerful; unique and not to be seen watching the show; and the two best anime moments in history, in my opinion. In addition, opening and ending topics are great. Anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple chart as soon as you understand it. While the show's focus on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, opinion is from her friend Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural things (such as Santa Claus, extraterrestrials, time travelers, ghosts, esperi), but will soon end up with Haruhi, who is the strangest girl in school and will prefer dating a stranger, considering all people worthless. She even joined every club in school to find something interesting, but as soon as she joined, she ended up so fast. On the "advice" from Kyon, Haruhi decides to form her own club with the Kyon Club. Haruhi founded in the literary club hall of the SOS Brigade - her mission to investigate supernatural cases (I think Scooby-Doo Minus Dog, Masked Man and Mystery Machine). Haruhi "recruits" three other members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a bookworm of species who spends very little and spends most of his time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who Haruhi forces Haruhi to think of she needs a cute mascot to do some things. She is often forced into Haruhi costumes to further her cuteness. The third is a friendly and social student who always smiles. While Haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people, she couldn't be any better. While Kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three on the other hand are rather unique - Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a traveler traveling from the future and Itsuki is an esper (person who has an ESP). All three have come to watch Haruhi, who can only have a lot of God, and when he gets bored, he can be able to discover his strength and create a whole new world and Kyon is somehow involved. Br /> The show is worth watching with great characters, music and some cheerful and beautiful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references including Mikura's cleavage to be exposed or touched several times, and several swear words also used. Besides, the show is one of the greats.
