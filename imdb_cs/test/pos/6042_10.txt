I haven't seen this great movie in fifty years, but I put a comment on it anyway. While the JACK WEBB'S movie was undoubtedly intended as pure entertainment - introducing basic training on the seas of Parris Island in realistic terms as hard character-building exercises - it was said that the military feared that the film would deter recruitment Yippee. It didn't work like that. The film showed that joining the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people had ever realized. I personally met a lot of guys who joined the Marines shortly after they saw DI. The lines in the recruitment centers were so long that the Marines had more recruits than they did. <br /> <br /> That's the way it is. America will always strive to make the young people the best - while slackers and birth defeats into nothing. In 2007, we don't have any films that inspire patriotism, devotion to duties of any kind, positive values, and so on. What we do are films that inspire airheady to be the main characters, beer drinkers to get beer, other negative values. Sample # 1 is that airhead teen travesty and beer gzzling epic SUPERBAD is now # 81 in the list of all the times of big movies. Values? What does it mean, values?
