I said I wasn't expecting a lot of sitting down to watch "The Couch Trip" is a shortage. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it would be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard that Chevy Chase was playing a condom and the title of the movie includes the word "couch", winks, winks. Then I found out that it had something to do with the mental institution and the patient escaping. My expectations decreased even lower. Literally, I was expecting a funny movie - the kind of one you smile at once and start feeling like you were a little cheated. And in a way it's a cheap comedy - it doesn't have the biggest gags, the story is ridiculous, but you know what? All the while I looked at it, I had a big, stupid smile on my face. Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a psychiatric patient who may or may not be really mental. He gives a psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), a lot of grief and suffering, which leads us to believe that he is a reasonable man after all. After a little rebellion at Buffy's psychiatric institute, Burns is waiting for a tongue-banging from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out that callers on the second line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird came to fill in for a radio shrink named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who with his wife Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird to be so bad he even booked his plane ticket. Burns escapes from the institute with the help of a receptionist and goes to O'Hare. Get a Dr. Baird, he gets on the plane and eventually appears in the air like Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" one man says, and the other man says, "It's because they really care about them." Donald Becker (late, great Walter Matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes as trousers and shirts exposed at jail. To keep him calm, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is closed. Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife are in dispute. He flies home to end his short vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show is not really Dr. Baird, but no one trusts him. He gets a real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he lost his card, so the police take them as dice and don't listen to their story. Noticed While Watching This Movie: Burns Presents Dr Baird, but he is never asked for his identification number, even if he claims a ticket (he was robbed, he says, but still made sure he was Baird). If Burns becomes so famous, how is it that the real Dr Baird in Chicago has never heard people talk about him? Word travels. Finally, why would the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that means) without watching their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I couldn't take care of it honestly. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. I enjoyed it. Her ideas are basically ridiculous and not realistic at all, but Dan Aykroyd gives a really lively performance as a half-loon that makes "The Couch Trip" a trip that is worth taking. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - John Ulmer
