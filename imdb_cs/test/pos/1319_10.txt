This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike virtually any other movie I can name, I've never seen this movie and I think it would be better if they changed it or that or that. Is it the definition of a work of art? I think yes. Every brush stroke in Mishima is perfect and all this comes from Schrader's script. I've always liked the work of Paul Schrader (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing movie), but while his writing often looks at the bombastic, his directorial style is usually non-existent. I think this is intentional because his films usually deal with the search for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and cruel. His style suits his themes by presenting his characters in a simple and realistic way, allowing them to show the viewer the truth about the situation. Imagine Schrader driving a Taxi Driver or a Bringing Out The Dead instead of Scorsese instead of Scorsese. But as well as the protagonists of these two films, while the Mishima man was the ideal material of Schrader, right-wing, futile and contrary to society, his works were fine and beautiful. In fact he had a secondary writing career as a woman writer, spewing out what may reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. So you don't have to imagine that Schrader was the perfect man to capture the subtlety and beauty of the film. I think the movie shows it was. The script helped him split Mishima into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, static compositions. His death, for which he will always be best remembered, is a manual documentary style. And his mind is represented by dramatized excerpts from his novels, each of which reveals the thought processes of this complex man who has hardly ever written a character that would not reflect himself. These dramas are beautiful to look at, thanks to the remarkable production design of Eiko Ishioka and the imaginative performance of Schrader. In all parts, acting is excellent, especially from Ken Ogat as Mishima, who captures the basic magic, arrogance and narcissism of man. The photo is excellent and contains images that the viewer keeps forever. Finally, music is simply superb, perfectly matched with pictures, even if it is written and recorded before shooting, edited during the editorial process, and then re-recorded. How much music influenced the filming I do not know, but perfectly ties to the image. I have seen many ideas about what people think is the theme of the film is what Schrader is trying to say. You know, big things about life, death, etc. But I don't think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said it, the film just repeats itself.
