Sadly, every single person I'm asking says he's never heard of it. I remember it kindly from my early childhood (I wasn't a total of 10 when it came out). My favorite story was "Story Short". Something about how the story of "stone soup" was woven into a bigger story, every time. And then the narrator explains why he has no story, and that becomes the story itself. I've always been a Jim Henson fan, and that's just one of the reasons why. I'm adding this DVD to myself with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Endless Story, Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all the DVDs I share with my siblings who have 6, 5 and 4 years.
