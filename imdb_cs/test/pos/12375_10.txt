One of the best quiet dramas I've seen. Dark and dark as anything that the German Expressionists produced, it represented performances that were quite undervalued and naturalistic for today. No camera and no unintentional laughs due to wild eye-wave-flourishing history. Sjostrom performed convincing performances as a drunken, devastated and terrifying David Holm. The film, which was predominantly at night in a filthy Swedish shanty town, had a very claustrophobic feel to it. low key lighting and extensive use of irising. The story was deep, typically Scandinavian, a sense of despair and hopelessness: the film begins in a rather gloomy presence, and then we told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashback flashbacks - a pretty complex structure of stories for 1921), where a variety of chances of redemption are offered to him, but he doesn't take them, and we know he won't take them because we saw him die drunk and miserable and mean as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as I have seen in all theaters. Writing and directing are tight and intelligent, even today's standards. In several cases, Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise. The end might not be such a surprise for some viewers, but I didn't see it come. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves full recovery and DVD release. Or even a lousy budget release. It has to be just so that people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 to 10/10
