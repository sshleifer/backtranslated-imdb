During the preface of Clete Roberts, I began to think it was Ed Wood's production, but what's going on here is something hard. The story of crime and corruption in the southern city is narrated using a cast cast out of Hollywood's Poverty Row, making the film more realistic. There are no punches here, and sometimes the film reminds of "The Well" (1951). Black and white texture provides quality similar to news. For sure, younger viewers will be reminded of "The Blair Witch Project", but this is based on REAL events!
