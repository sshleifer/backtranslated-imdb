An unusual film about a man who befriended his social opposite for fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle made this film with his outrageous proud portrait of a working class that is stiff "Joe" in love with the past and the fear of the future and concern for the present. The first half hour of the show is the debut of young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a weak willing rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend, full of full nude scenes. Her boyfriend's movie is a weak spot, a poorly portrayed addict and a dealer who meets his demise after Sarrandon overdose. We meet Boel's Joe at the bar as he spews and boasts of minorities, crimes, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that the later TV character of Norman Lear from Archie Bunker is based on a cleared-up version of Joe. The comparison even translates into Joe's wife and personal life and entertainment. Joe pulls himself into Bill Compton's life, Meliss's father, and they both make an unlikely couple looking for Melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to drug addicts she calls friends. Their search will lead them to a "merrymaking", as Joe calls it, a free love festival that is powered by drugs, a lot of nudity, and surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe. and the murderous ending that marks the sharp and frosty end of Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a humorous film that is on the surface at least against violence and against racism. However, Joe's main character becomes a turning-point that he fears when he enters illegal and unbridled sexual excessive fluctuations. So in this respect, the film lacks a powerful message and lets you wonder what it is.
