Just as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings quite well and a huge step over previous attempts to animate the popular Gaul of everyone. For someone who is not familiar with the famous comedian series, the show would be difficult to watch, but for those of us who know it, it's a pleasure to watch. First of all, animation is much better than earlier comic editing. You can say that with the time and effort you really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around. As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the film and I see how fans of these titles might feel confused or a little let go, but I was so captured actually seeing one of my favorite comics childhood faithfully represented on the screen, any remorse I had was smaller in comparison. Minor spoilers follow ... Asterix and his loyal friend Obelix travel north to rescue their village boss's nephew, captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that the boy who teaches them about fear will be able to fly, thanks to poorly formulated advice from his druid village. In this process, the boy meets Viking Chief's daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc. Etc. Etc. If my explanation sounds convoluted, don't worry .. The storyline is easy to follow! Definitely a great purchase. You can buy this DVD through Amazon France, but be warned. I had to change the region setting on my computer to see it.
