Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks he's a critic. They resemble things that the average visitor does not even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. That was what I was expecting, so she was not disappointed. Steven gets a bad rap for putting his opinions into his movies, but that's also a reason to watch. Even more fun are the people who complain about his films, they say it's the worst and we shouldn't watch his movies, but still watch his movies. Everyone can comment on how bad they are. Who's the manikin? If you don't like his work, don't look at it. Then you will not have to submit to this supposedly painful event. Stop comparing movies with other movies and watching the movie on an individual basis and start enjoying movies again.
