Since I am a middle-aged mum alone, I greatly appreciated the fact that I saw the romance among adults, who conceal many questions that affect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the victim and the conflict the mother is going through and wants to do what's right for her children, but she has a happy life herself. I'm not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he's always doing a good job with a guy who's kind of jerky, but he'll know something about him. Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified compared to most other romantic films. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fell in love with Australia, she barely had a conversation with them, she thought she was very romantic. We got a lot more with Rodanthe. He buys him. Gives her free. That is beautiful. Intimacy, created by sharing the deepest uncertainty, fans in the flame of passion. How long it takes is irrelevant. Perhaps the film was a bit too subtle in the sense that it was the letters they shared in the following year, which deepened their relationship - another real way to get to know humans. As I enjoyed the storyline and the topics, the dialogue was not consistent in quality. Some lines were so true and other lines were awkward and flat. I also enjoyed relationships with teenage daughter Adrienne and her best friend, reminding us that there are many kinds of love, not just romantic love. It's not a light heart romantic comedy, rather a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a work of art - fairytale. Look at the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan-over house - very beautiful. I also enjoyed the music and scenery that together created the effect of placing as the third main character. It was this place away from their normal lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood to get out of Kleenex and enjoy the movie.
