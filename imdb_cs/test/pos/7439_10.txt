this movie is just amazing .. unfortunately not in shadow nor its shadow ... and i agree with the former opinion, only FF fans will really give the movie a real credit ... but for the rest .. i dare to watch it. the story is great, and I thought the game was over, but the screenwriters gave us a great story to god god of all RPGs ... as usual, it came from heaven;) ehehe but the little details they gave us (we fans games) are beautiful .. just like the ringtone is a battle winning song game, and even some moves are pretty familiar, just watch that it's a great movie a great story, great animation ... just 10/10
