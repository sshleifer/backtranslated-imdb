<br /> <br /> A kind of movie that requires too many viewers, but most of them fail. I think that for Mexican people who (either to support Mexican movies or willing to see film casts of top Mexican stars) have seen it, half of the people came out of the theater when I went to watch, it's definitely not the kind of movie that could be expected . I think that people from other countries, who dared to spend 2 hours, saw it until the very end, "what kind of crap". To understand Cronica de un desayuno, one must be Mexican and one must be familiar with low middle classes (or better still, be part of them). There is nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has so many families, at least in Mexico. One must see it with a wide open mind to accept it completely, this is not the kind of film that you fully understand after you look at it. The older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his couch RED, the sister will stay no matter how he wants to leave, the younger brother will go on a trip and all he cares about is yellow radio, the mother has to prepare breakfast for the family, regardless of how the situation is tense and unbearable. The father returned after who knows how long, allowing his mother to live a passion night that turns out to be momentary and ends up repeating all the attitudes of her sons ... Stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the film) travestit looking for his penis, factory worker and his suicide attempt, conquering the kisses of his girlfriend, fat man riding his bike after an interesting gay conversation with his sister? wife? Mom? ... Music doesn't pretend, but it does a lot, not more than a drum, cymbal, some strings. With a good movie like this, it was done and released. One of the best Mexican movies of all time, and one of the less well-understood, even Mexican ones, no matter how he feels with him. . <br /> <br />
