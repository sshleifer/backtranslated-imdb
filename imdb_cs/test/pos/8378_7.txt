The third person looks into the dark black-and-white photo of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller made by Turhan Bey, a former star of universal photography during the 1940s. It's a professionally filmed story of jealousy that leads to murder when the famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes too obsessed with his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and is about to make a plan to murder the man he has an affair with. The taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) happens to give a woman's mistress a lift to the hotel as she exits from a moment to chat with a worker kicking down the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to dampen the sound of the bullet he has inserted into the passenger's head from behind the rear of the car. When Buka returns to his cabin, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. After taking off, he reports the murder to the police, changes his mind, and decides to change his identity with a dead man who has an American passport, which means that Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity conspiracy becomes stronger when a girlfriend (Lederer's wife) appears at the hotel to blame Buk for impersonating a dead man. But here's a nice workout, with lots of tense scenes as Buka and Leder's wife plan to run away from the authorities until the final confrontation with the killer and the police. It is very absorbable, well done and is interested in a number of excellent atmospheric photos from Vienna that will remind most visitors of The Third Man. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
