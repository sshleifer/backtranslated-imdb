... and I'm so disappointed that I don't seem to have bought a DVD or VHS from it anywhere. It's a mix, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors, and Molly Ringwald is wonderful as a spoiled teenager. It was done when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with the edge! <br /> <br /> If someone has this copy or knows where to get it ... please leave me a message - it will be greatly appreciated.
