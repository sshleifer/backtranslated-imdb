It was really a "nightmare" movie; I saw it about cable television about nine years ago and didn't forget it because. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the streets of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and leads a criminal life in the company of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; stealing, buying, selling drugs and murdering to survive every day ... In the first half of the film, Pixote is caught by the police and sent to a sadistic orphanage, witnessing every kind of abuse of older prisoners and guards to other children; One night, Lilica's friend is killed after the beating, so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during the rebellion. The rest of the film will show Pixote a descent into a criminal life; he does not show any feelings or remorse after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings are not useful in the world he lives in, but there is a subtle scene in the middle of the film; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wishing) to have one of his friends at the Reform Institute. I thought it was a poetic and melancholic scene in the midst of all those horrible events ... the boys seem to want not only for their friend but for a better life. Hector Babenco's "Pixote" is a daring and depressing film that is not ashamed to show the harshest reality many people - including me - tend to ignore or misunderstand. This movie will probably open your eyes and make you a better and compassionate person.
