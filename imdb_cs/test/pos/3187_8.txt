I'm trying to find somewhere to buy a DVD / VHS copy of "Isn't it Shocking?" I was seven years old when I saw this movie and lived in the city where it was filmed. A few things from my family were used as props in the movie, and a couple of my friend's houses were used in several scenes. Filming in the city and the surrounding area was good. I only saw the film once and would like to get a copy, so now I can show my family a movie. I made extensive searches online with no luck and I was wondering if anyone would have any ideas to try to get a copy of this movie?
