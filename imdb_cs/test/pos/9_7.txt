I've seen this story before, but my kids don't. A boy with a troubled past joins the army, faces his past, falls in love and becomes human. This time, Mentor plays Kevin Costner perfectly; An ordinary person with everyday problems, who lives in extraordinary beliefs to save lives. After losing his team he takes the position of teacher of the next generation of heroes. Young problem recruits are played by Kutcher. While his scenes with local love interest are a little harder and don't generate enough heat to melt the butter, he praises Costner well. I have never understood Sela Ward as a neglected woman and felt she should want Costner to leave his concern for his safety, as opposed to his selfish needs. But her presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two non-accredited stars of the film are Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful powers that should not be taken for granted in real life or in this film. The film has a few slow spots and could use unnecessary 15 minutes to strengthen the relationship. But it still works. Rescue scenes are intense and well-angled and adjusted to give maximum effect. This movie gets applause from the audience. And the applause of my two sons.
