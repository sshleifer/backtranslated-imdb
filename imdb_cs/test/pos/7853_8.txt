I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was in the Madison County Bridges, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He can pull it out, which gives very good performance as well as the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and there were no great holes that the director would occasionally try to cover up - we would talk about an excellent movie. He remains powerful, however. <br /> <br /> 8
