SPOILERS ** Actually based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a homosexual who was murdered by GI on vacation because of his sexual orientation. "Crossfire" is about a violently anti-Semitic GI who, through her own failures and frustrations in her life, gets into the hands of Jewish persuasion. Who obviously feels threatened. Getting into a tank at a local DC barley mill sober American servicist Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, discovers Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and begins to bend a little. sarcastically, friendly to him. Montgomery seems to be a bit ticked on Samuels because she talks to her best friend and friend GI, Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel also goes through, which Neanderthal Montgomery cannot, to the sensitive young GI who is in the arts, is an artist and painter outside, about the war, about the Second World War that has just ended. Just like uncertain peace, if that's what it is with the dawn of an atomic bomb, it is now to follow it in this very dangerous and unstable world. What made Montgomery more outrageous than anything else about Samuel is that he is clearly Jewish. That more than anything else is enough for Montgomery racist to want to do Samuel. Samules Inviting Mitchell to join him and his girlfriend Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in his apartment, a couple of drinks and keep up a very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. It seems to be very jealous and hurt and refused Montgomery, along with his drunk but somewhat helpless, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuel are, friend and colleague GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later uninvited that night to Samuel 'Place. The party is over when Mitchell and Miss Lewis disappeared, two very drunk GIs fall into place. The fact that Samuels, in Montgomery's sick and anti-Semitic mind, stole Mitchell from him to whip him into a white hot madness. Montgomery and Bowers storm into Samuel's home, attacking a well-stacked alcohol cabinet, and Montgomery takes a few swine, against the strong objections of Samuel, the very expansive and refined Samuel wines and spirits that are unlike the diluted and inexpensive booze that is in contrast Montgomery is used to gzzling. All this soon led to a violent and brutal attack on Samuel, who attacked angry psychotic and drunk Montgomery, with Bowers on the cool couch of all the alcoholics he had consumed, beating the poor and innocent men to death. The movie "Crossfire" then goes into long and tedious because it's obvious from the start who's Samuels' killer, investigating why Samuels wounded and decorated World War II veteran who got a purple heart in battle at Okinawa, he was murdered by Montgomery, who acted as if he was really interested in it, yeah, in search of the Samuels killer, who is actually alone. This so-called voluntary action on the part of Montgomery to get rid of her suspicion of being a man who killed him. Montgomery is so ridiculous and even for someone who prides himself on himself as a very clever, stupid man who constantly opens his great jap and spews anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and curses about Samuel's murder ! It only causes suspicion of oneself and anyone else. I think the guy just couldn't help it. Not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuel, who in his sick mind was one of "those", even murdered his friend, who is afraid of death in the murder of Samuels, Bowers! Who is the racist way of thinking in Montgomery one of "us"! Just because he was worried that Bowers would talk to the police to save his own neck, so he focused on Montgomey in Samuels' death. <br /> <br /> For the Capt Detective. Finlay, Robert Young, doesn't take so long to see the apparent lies and scams of Montgomerys and then set him up by having another GI friend. his Leroy (William Phipps), who was the ass of all his stupid and racist jokes, set an arrogant creeping movement. It has Montgomery returning to the scene of her crime where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was prepared for him. It was all Captain Finlay needed to get Montgomery to panic when Montgomery saw that the product was awake, and run away behind him directly into the police backup fire. A little now, but in 1947, when it was released, it hit very hard. "Crossfire" dealt with the horrors of anti-Semitism when he was kept under cover and out of sight at that time, in almost every Hollywood movie after World War II for the evil of racism in the US and Europe. Even after World War II and what happened to the Jews in it. When it was supposed to be given a very full and honest exhibitor, the movie go to the public that it rightfully deserved.
