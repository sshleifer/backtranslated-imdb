I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always been in love with Mrs. Hayworth's look, so I thought I'd try. This may be the best example for multi-talented Mrs. Hayworth. She never looked more attractive in the film (with the possible exception of "Guild" where the sexual symbol is par excellence). Rita is more than enthusiastically assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. Comedy can be dated, but it's still pretty fun. Kelly makes one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the picture of himself out the window. But Rita drives this whole movie. The excellent cast, featuring Otto Kruger and always amazing, wise Eve Arden, won't hurt. Rita sings, Rita dances, looks incredibly beautiful all the time! Music can be little classical, but the lyrics to most melodies are smart enough. <br /> <br /> This movie works better than 'Guild', which I think is a bad movie. She also directs the 'Guild' to Mrs Hayworth's loan, and the Guild drives every redheaded male madman. <br /> <br /> The film will survive well after all these years. A lot of candy feet for male audience is a nice bonus!
