Taking into account all the comedies with the military situation that were made in history, someone had to be the first. One could do the case that in the shoulder shoulders, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre. It is hard to believe that it was a bold step back then. When you think that some of the best films including such people as Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy have included military service and during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at. In World War I, Chaplin, along with other stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, went on a bond tour. He was a great supporter of the cause of the Allies, unusual for someone in his view of the left wing. It would only be natural that Tramp would be worked out, and unfortunately, flummox would break into all. Many of the things you would see in World War II's comedy began with Shoulder Arms. Chaplin didn't have more imitators because the war ended within a few weeks of the film's release. The comedy art form was founded by one of the greatest comedy genes.
