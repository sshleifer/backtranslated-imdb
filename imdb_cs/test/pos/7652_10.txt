My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled over him to the PBS station and always asked when it was now. It reminds them of their grandmother who cares for them in summer. It's also funny and sometimes they can't stop talking about one or the other scene. I would definitely recommend this show to all young children. It's very clean and shows you to slow down and not about watching TV all day. When Nana reads the story, she's slow and talks about every page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read another book to my girls at bedtime and talked about the book instead of going through it just to get them to sleep.
