OK, yes, it's bad, yes its a complete fluff, yes it makes dobbin mule look like an Oscar winner, but look at it like I was 13, special effects were largely nonsistant in 90% of movies, back in good Ole days when movies needed a story line .. OK, so the plot is a bit risky .. but wow I got into this movie as a kid in the 80s. Kitschy Rock, Bad Special Effects But Airborne Aircraft Fighting And It Had A Queen One Vision On The Soundtrack .. See Even The Worst Things Have A Silver Lining .. All If You Want The Bad Movie To Show 12 Year Older Who Hates Computer Effects (If such a movie) is an ideal choice
