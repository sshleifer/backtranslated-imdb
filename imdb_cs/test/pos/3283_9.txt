Okay, so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure he'll upset a few liberals. The thing is, South Park is kidding everyone, just like the Simpsons. If you are offended that the politician you like is fun, then you may need a better sense of humor and take the show too seriously. It has been said that this episode is cheerful and one of the best. The image of Al Gores is merry, Cartman's scheme is terribly bad and the results will make you laugh on the floor. That's basically everything you'd ever want from the South Park episode and it's one of my favorites. I'm not going to comment too much on the plot because I don't want to give up.
