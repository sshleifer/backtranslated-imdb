If you're "there" and "done that" you'll absolutely love this movie. I have and "there" I mean underground clubs and home parties, where it is far more rare to find people who are just drunk than to find people high in ears for extacy, speed or LSD. By "By" I think dancing and sweating like crazy for eight hours or so in a row with out and brakes and that follows the way to a long blow of no-can-sleep and almost want to die, followed by a week just waiting for the next weekend to do it all again. So, although this movie is one of my favorite favorites, I will surely understand why some people, or most people, wouldn't want it.
