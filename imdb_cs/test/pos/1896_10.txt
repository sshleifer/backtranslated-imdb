This movie is more fun than one. It's action. He has humor. It's an attitude. Dolemite has a whole girl's kung fu army! And that's what the movie offers as a movie. It is also badly acted by some, the mic does more than one look appearance, and some "blows" are missing feet. But if you make a movie so cool, who has the time to pay attention to the "details"? This movie rocks. Lend it tonight if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I don't regret it!
