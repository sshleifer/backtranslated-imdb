I just read why this show was canceled, and I was a bit of a mess. This was my favorite baby and I always watched it when it came no matter how many times I saw the episode. Sure, the effects weren't great, but they weren't terrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and it was a nice 70's atmosphere that is always nice to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. In fact, he had no comic book comics, but most of the comic book live adaptations had no comic book comics. Spidey's powers were a little different here, Spidey's sense, and he could climb the walls, but he wasn't as strong as Spider-man comics. He was super strong though as I remember the episode where he broke into the room by breaking the door knob away, he just was not a hurler car that he was from the comic book can be. The show was located in Los Angelos, so there weren't like human buildings swaying, but they did fine with the site. It's nice that this show actually has a shooter and not an organic film shooter. I love movies, but part of me wishes to start over and make more clever Spidey pants that have a mechanical web shooter. This show had a good star like Peter Parker and was fine as Spider-man, it's nice to see Spidey who basically doesn't live in slums like in movies. Neither this show nor the film has Spider-Man, who is fast offensive like the one in the comic book. Still, this show was fun without being as sinister as the Batman show.
