The death of Visconti in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. The infinitely rich death in Venice is definitely; but in other important ways it is an unsatisfactory film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and distance from von Aschenbach's literary career and production; its imperialist way, its layers on a layer of programmed, confident behavior. When Tadzio appears and an obsession appears, it is clear that Aschenbach has no idea who is under his gilded age and has lived his life carefully. After Mann saw him sometimes when Tadzio saw him, "lonely," he divides himself into two. Aschenbach No. 1 engulfs the sight of a beautiful 14-year-old boy, then attempts to intellectually process the dizziness of blood pressure as it would be a work of art - a "divine" artwork. However, Aschenbach No. 2 appears to be a stalker who controls and then replaces the rational Aschenbach No. 2. it remains a far-reaching ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every bit of self-knowledge comes too strong and late; The excitement of sexual flushing is too great to resist. The fact that Venice is caught by the disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher bets. When he finally whispers "I love you" under the breath, he knows that everything is lost and the gap is waiting. Is any of this filmable? Perhaps and Visconti creates a visual feast that cannot be broken. But there are mistakes: He and Dirk Bogarde make Aschenbacha sympathetic; Mann didn't do it again. The film is dominated by Aschenbach's POV and is expected to be identified. But nowhere on the screen is there a man who is detached from within. Bogarde switches between subconsciously controlled and ridiculously temperamental ease - but what's under her? Bogard's reactive power has no anchorage. Mann writes a character who, in his imagination, makes the Dance of the Seven Veils, all too aware of the implications that this freedom encourages, but are unable to reluctantly resist. Also, Visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach's - dramatizing Mann's discussion of art and artists. These scenes are badly written catastrophes, and the actor who captures Alfred is hard to watch. Aschenbach Visconti is also a Germanist composer of the Germanic age who I think works for film; and Mahler's symphonies replace Aschenbach's novels. Unfortunately, Mahler's great music is poorly recorded and very poorly played. So Death in Venice, as Visconti gives it to us, is not a complete achievement that could be, but as a purely visual experience, its power cannot be denied. All film students, especially cinematographers, will want to look.
