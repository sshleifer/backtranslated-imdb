it's a real drama, there's no other drama that scares me like this, the characters aren't your typical Islamic terrorist, you have blond hair, blue eyes of a guy who's as stupid as he is, is a converted Muslim. A well-respected businessman who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has turned to Islam, but has clearly expressed the Koran's word to a whole new level. The hero of the conspiracy is Darwyn, who is a secret FBI agent who has infiltrated a terrorist cell and has to do all kinds of divine terrible things to prevent him from being revealed. The first episode is the little taste of what should follow. Though they are Islamic terrorists, drama has a unique way to point out that not all Muslims are extremists who are gratifying for those who deal with racism, given that half of the terrorist cells are converts of Islam, you think that maybe they are them. fear. The most dramatic drama I've ever seen. The reason it's so cool is that you never know who your friends, your husband, or your neighbors are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
