When I did not read the book, I was more open to my new interpretation, which each director gives to his medium (which is a film, not a "letter" of literature) about this particular film. I was glad that the Holocaust, which took place in Russia (and its neighboring countries), eventually received some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel to Russians and Russian Jews. If you read history and see monuments built in Smolensk and the surrounding regions, you will understand this film and why many were silent when they were supposed to talk. Certainly it was time for this to be recorded, and I hope there will be more stories. It's time.
