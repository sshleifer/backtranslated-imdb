I just discovered this dark 70s horror while browsing on YouTube. For a low budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual stimulation leading to a surprisingly shocking completion. While there is one woman who is constantly pulling off her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac makes these scenes important to the story, and there is one scene with a curly young man trying to seduce her, who cried out before she came back insanely. The young nurse who comes and gets hired is seductive herself and I'm not surprised she posed on the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes seem ridiculous. For the most part, don't look into the basement (that's the title I saw on YouTube) providing enough drama and frost for a fun B-movie.
