It's an amazing movie like a movie - it gets 8 out of 10. Like a piece of precision history ... wishes to be more loving, but it's 5 out of 10. And I think I'm actually very charitable. What was it like - the man of the horse and the saber, who was the youngest "boy" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War and ended his dying command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Expressed, militant, lousy, bloody, ambitious, clever, overly clever, Indian enemy, Indian friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant / Lee, and Sherman / Jackson. Only with growing awareness of his career mistakes - an overly ambitious stimulus - did his reputation decline. To date, George Armstrong Custer remains the best-remembered figure in the military annals of our history to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar battle - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men at Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived March and World War II). Custer appeared in more movies than the much better generals, due to Western adventures and Little Big Horn. It is a pity that the details of a real career have never been so lovingly processed as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still strong. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently warned of another film review on the subject, survived George until 1933, so her effective storytelling was still in place eight years later. Custer was seen as our brave but brave knight wandering, and with the shadow of World War II we approached the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would fully understand and approve. So we got the idea that it was hot, but it was patriotic. Although almost pushed out of the West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in class 1861, and it would be really stupid to be selective about such a warrior that year. You see, most of the so-called West Point military talent (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed every northern "point" person they could find. Custer's Civil War career should be devoted to a closer study - was affiliated with General Staff - In - Chief George B. McClellan and distinguished himself in the Peninsula campaign and other Eastern Front Wars. But he was a cavalryman - and he would have come under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's friend Phil Sheridan in the second part of the war. In particular he served with a hyphen and a difference in the battle of Cedar Bay, which ended the threat of Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the confederation and rose to a position like Custer - Mortally Wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur throughout the latter's last night alive). After the war things fell apart. He wanted his flower - Major Generalship to stand (it wasn't because it was a battlefield promotion). They only had Lieutenant Colonelship, who was supposed to put him in a shrunken army along the border. He tried to play politics, making a mistake in supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most of the Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He allegedly admired Indians (he was certainly eloquent in writing them about them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 by Indian women and children who ended up in judicial combat. Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a circle of politicians (it went up to war minister, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading positions for profit. He destroyed Belknap and left a black eye on the Grant Administration. That got him into a kennel with Grant and Sherman (who was a former Belknap commander) and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the last Big Horn campaign. And there was immortality. <br /> <br /> This career is a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man from 1850 - 1876 according to the 2007 standards? Would we like to do it in a hundred years? Surely this could happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. his main films. His latest film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined by melancholy over the fate of the hero's character. In support of actors such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn they did very nicely as friends, enemies, or even treacherous sneakers (Kennedy). As a fun piece of myth that is still tall - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
