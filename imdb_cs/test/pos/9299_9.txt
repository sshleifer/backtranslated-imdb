I know that they should not comment on the comments of other users, but I will say that many negative reviews come from people who already knew a lot about Manhattan and were upset about things that were left out. (From his book 'Smoking in Bed' it seems that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is next.) Before I watched the movie, I knew very little and found it riveting. Dwight Schultz is absolutely fascinating because Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he has no better roles and other leaders. John Cusack and Paul Newman are as good as ever. One might guess with different scenarios or direction choices, but as it is the movie is very intense and terrible at times and overall I give it four stars out of five.
