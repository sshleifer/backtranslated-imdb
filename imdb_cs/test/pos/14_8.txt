I attended a preliminary screening of this film, which wasn't sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both gave less than unforgettable performances and movies. While the basic "general" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher have produced powerful performances that play very well. The human fragility and strengths of their characters were unbelievably played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was an unforgettable emotional moment. The "concrete" storyline was an education in itself depicting a personal sacrifice, and the demanding physical training of elite coastguard rescuers must go through in preparing their only work and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wowing" ... I didn't see such an angry sea from "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnivale" - great to see him again) played Captain Kodiak, Alaska Coast Guard base in a strong, compelling role leader with the assumption and necessary ice water in his veins. The film beautifully, and finally, gives a long delay to exposure and respect for the Coast Guard; at the end the audience applauded.
