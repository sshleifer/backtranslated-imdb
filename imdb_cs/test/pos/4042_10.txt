First, I remember the vague narration of this story in primary school, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I'm a little familiar with the story. Many of them, however, have changed and there are many differences and mistakes (sometimes unnecessary) in a movie that die fans say they don't appreciate. However, as a whole, I really love this movie. First I saw it before Christmas about 2 years ago (but the first part), then I caught the whole thing again last Christmas probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it may be a bit exaggerated and long, but with an engaging story, decent acting (especially from the freezing Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costume and little touches of magic it's really special film - which reminds me of Christmas. Despite the differences in the book, I think the film incorporates new themes and ideas (seasons with autumn, winter, etc., thinking that the new thieving character is autumn) throughout the film, Once you notice it's pretty hot and brilliantly done. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I've been waiting for a long time on DVD, and fortunately I've seen an ad showing a number of free DVDs offered in the Daily Mail, which I don't normally get, so I got a problem yesterday and finally I have a DVD. If you missed it and would like this rare DVD for Region 2, I suggest you pick up the chips from the Daily Mail and send them away because your DVD will be delivered by Christmas. So for a little escape to Christmas this year, give yourself a fire, get cozy and watch how you and the kids probably really made this great movie. If you don't, it will probably repeat on Channel 4 this year, so upload it!
