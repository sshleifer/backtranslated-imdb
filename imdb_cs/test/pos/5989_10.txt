I like foreign movies and that's one of the best. I tend not to see it as a comedy as it is presented and find a commentary on how we see others around us. Firmine lead in the film is not considered to be home to a large company, and people say and do things around her all the time they wouldn't have said before others. <br /> <br /> leaves her with information that can cause or break a mere mortal. :) This actress is amazing as this character and it's annoying story. There is a basic story and almost many stories within the story in this film. I just hope that if someone decides to make an American-English version of this movie, it's not a vein of three men and a child who would definitely do this for the FILM, they must see .....
