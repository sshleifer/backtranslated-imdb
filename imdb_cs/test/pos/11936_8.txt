Colombian terrorists hold hostage to a US military school until their demands are met. Students decide to fight. Will they be able to do this? Stupid assumption, but the movie actually works. The group of children who fought was all over and came when this movie came out in 1991: Sean Astin (looking very cute); Wil Wheaton (looking miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (Latino token that is very handsome, very muscular and is mostly depicted in anything but tight underwear); T.E. Russell (token black) and Shawn Phelan. None of them are very good actors (except Astin), but who cares? This is a mindless action movie. The only other good performances are Denholm Elliott (with the ball as director) and Louis Gossett Jr. as Dean. . In other words --- FUN! <br /> <br /> Only a complaint (and that is less) - it's a little too long (there are three ends) and there's LOTS of occasional, bloody violence (R's earned). Still, I enjoyed it a lot.
