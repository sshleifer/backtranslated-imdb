It is a pity that someone did not have smart news to release this film to the theaters. I never heard of it when it appeared on the cable. After the first shock of realizing it, it's not like any other movie you've seen from Bringing Up Baby, you have to let it sweep and run with it. No, until it is not over you realize that it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, fulfillment of wishes, for beginning. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she has never been better. The entire cast has a conspiracy feeling and knows what they're doing without asking for gratuitous hamming except when required, like Julie Andrews's bits or Jonathan Pryce's videos. If you're not carefree, you won't get it. (See the bizarre review of Mark Adnum, who deals with Stephanie Beacham's addition, her career, and OBE's brother for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives.) Since it's a cue, I can also spend time eulogizing Amo Gulinella's star portrait. as a TV station trainee or Jack Noseworthy's shower scene. Reject all previous movie comedy concepts and have fun. I loved it.
