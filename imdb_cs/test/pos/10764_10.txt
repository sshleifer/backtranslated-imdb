I can't imagine why she hasn't been theatrically released yet. It's a great cast, with Sutherland, Lane, and especially Chris Evans, who does a great job. Wake up, studio execs! The story is based on the author / writer experience growing up as a "poor child" in an extremely rich community where class is everything and makes a difference in all aspects of life, from clothing to justice. During the Q&A film, the author was asked about his experiences and, in particular, about what we do not know about ultra-rich. He said they are not stupid, they are very smart (as opposed to how they can appear), have plans and are a threat! <br /> <br /> This movie is in many ways very topical.
