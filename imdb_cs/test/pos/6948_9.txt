This show came to Canada through PBS in the mid-1990s and I really loved it. Even 10 years later, he watched various news networks, I can't help but think of the cynical manipulation that continues in the name of ratings and various "ponies" we all see on television, as shown in various Frontline episodes. The scripts are firmly written, and the actors have perfect comic timing, and none of them are burdened with idiotic laughter. There's a lot of funny stuff that is really well executed and we don't have to tell him when to laugh and laugh. I don't understand why this show has never been a genuine jewel in North America! I was really excited to see available DVDs, even if they were in PAL format. I thought I'd rip them into my computer and then watch the converted files. I took the chance and ordered it from ABC ?? 6 to 8 weeks later I had all three seasons. Even better, it worked on my NTSC DVD player. I think every player who bought xvid / divx will play. Great stuff! 10 years later, the episodes will all last well! You don't need to know anything about Australian politics to get to the humor because it will be familiar to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10 day Frontline fest and still giggled for weeks after watching all 39 episodes
