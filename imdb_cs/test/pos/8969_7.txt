Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for Mujaheddin's hidden support in Afghanistan after the USSR's invasion of the 1980s. This conflict played an important role in the last years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> In terms of filmmaking, the Charlie Wilson War is a clear winner. It's well written, well-behaved, and well-shot. While most of the attention is given to Tom Hanks for another great performance, I was even more impressed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's turnover as CIA Operator Gust Avrakotos. The scenes of Soviet attacks on captivated villages and the refugee camp were effectively pulling their hearts. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and hearing that Congressman Wilson must go through to ensure the required funding. However, there are two complaints about the film. The first is that there is a subplot involving a scandalous investigation that is not well developed and serves as a minor distraction to the storyline as such. The second complaint is that the film lacks some context of war. The film makes Mujaheddin look innocent victims, and while they suffered great civilian casualties, Mujaheddin was in fact rebels attempting to overthrow Afghanistan. This government, completely ignored in the film, struggled surprisingly to suppress the rebellion, and later called on the Soviet Union to support their efforts. The film also ignores that the US helped Mujaheddin before the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film suggested the unintended consequences of our hidden actions - the consequences we still feel today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a coherent story. (I didn't read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Regardless of the complaints, I enjoyed watching Charlie Wilson's war and recommending it. I would like to give priority to a film that more accurately depicts the complexity of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syria, but viewers have better combined with the coherent story of Charlie Wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in Syria.
