This is a great movie, all 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was made over time and pulled straws. But you want to watch it because it tells the end of the story. Just not how we might think it should end. These films forced me to be there in all the hardships, love, tears and laughter that people in this movie threw. It's one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times it is. There are some parts in the movie that little children don't understand, and the older ones don't have to be old to watch. But it is a great movie that has lasted over 20 years.
