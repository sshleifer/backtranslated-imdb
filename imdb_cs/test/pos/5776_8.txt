I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty didn't want to be separated from her siblings. However, the juvenile justice system does not care. When Patty looked at the file, the judge sent her to a juvenile prison. He claimed to have violated privacy rules by looking at private files. She just wanted her family. I couldn't blame her. Parents were not even fit parents. One of the smaller children had to have a toilet. Father stopped and let go. He left him and left the children stuck in the gas station. Patty had to take power to protect them because she was the oldest. They were housed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker got them back as a family. The senior social worker kept telling him to get stuck and not interfere. He was too mad. It was he who had Patty put in a juvenile facility. Why didn't they go to the Father who was released from prison for leaving. Yet children are caught in the middle and feel uncertain.
