This is an amazing movie and I still love it! It's so magical and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend to people of all ages. I promise you won't be disappointed! Characters are always so engaging, so real, you'll just love them! The story of Gerdy and Kai's love really impresses you and gives you a little spark of magic in your life. I don't see how someone cares if the film matches the book, I think the movie was amazing! I haven't read a book or guess what? I do not care. In fact, if the film and the book are so different, then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it. <br /> <br /> I thought acting was bloody brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays Snow Queen, so bad, so cold - you just have to hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerd, a girl with love who is determined to find her love no matter what it means and goes on an amazing adventure. And I just love all the Snow Queen's Sisters (Spring Witch, Summer Princess and Autumn Robber) that are so fun and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in a while, so forgive me if I make a mistake .... but there's no doubt that I will always love this movie.
