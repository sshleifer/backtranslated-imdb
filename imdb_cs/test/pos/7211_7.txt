Could it be Troma? Some scenes have an almost "A" cinematic look. Acting is generally competent (both lead and sister-sub were particularly good and I liked some of the confrontations between young Capulets and Ques); scenes were edited smoothly; the plot is coherent. It is funny. He has a hip, an original soundtrack. He has the usual Three Tough Swings and Low Humor, but I don't think Shakespeare thinks so much. In fact, I think he might have some good laughs out of it. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes, and the usual collection of Troma's self-deprecating stupidity. I'm not going to tell you it was a Kane citizen, but it's pretty inspired by low budget.
