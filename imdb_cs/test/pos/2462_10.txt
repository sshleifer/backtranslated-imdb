The era of the Vietnam War is certainly far ahead of my time, but I have always been interested in it and I have seen many films about it. All the others I saw behaved strictly with the fight front. When I read the description of "The War At Home", I found this concept interesting. No Vietnam War film I've ever heard about what happens to a soldier as soon as the fight ends. One night, as he passed through the channels, the film was broadcast on the Sundance Channel. I lowered the remote control and settled back. Within two hours I didn't move from my place; it is one of those films that are of great interest to you because there is no way to predict what will happen next. This movie made me a huge fan of Emilia Estevez. I enjoyed it as Billy Kid in "Young Guns" but I never saw anything. Emilio proved very talented in writing and directing as well as playing. <br /> <br /> Stimulating the film is very good. I was hardly thinking about where it was going. What amazes me is that he didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It's a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably never will be as they remember him again. Definitely worth seeing.
