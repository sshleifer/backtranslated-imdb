I first learned about Commander's Log when I was on concom for the local science fiction congress. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks, and Brian Oberquell went out to show the video and put a couple of tapes on the TV. I must say, I was very pleased when I finally had a chance to see the show. A comparison with the Red Dwarf is inevitable because the Red Dwarf's first season was also shot on a low budget (although Commander's log must set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time), and so have to fill in the "eye candy" "with good writing and action. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious but clueless personality. Bowlsby's original idea was to tell the story in two-minute "interstitials." among other shows during the evening, though for some reason, Space didn't get how cold the idea would be, and so the interstitials were all rolled into one hour-show that Space usually showed in two half-hour episodes. Existing DVD does not include episode 3 (which premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was viewed at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you are in contact with your local fannish community, you can catch news about being nearby.
