There are worse ways to spend the evening than watching this movie, even if it's tad predictable. Drew Barrymore is doing a very good job of making a fool in this film - an excellent casting option. I hardly believed that popular girls would finally accept it - in my experience the crowd had more memory than that, and when they knew how AWFUL Drew's character (ostrich feathers?), They kept them miles away at the beginning of the school year, no matter what who says her brother beats. (And does "Kole Slaw Food" really all that is popular?) I doubt it. As for the rooting of Drew's character who would win a big reporter - well, I hope she could come up with a story long before the ball. A little fought. When I said it all, it was a piece of fluff that would be fun if you didn't expect too much.
