This new Jeskid movie is amazing! Check it out and you'll be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a little girl from a broken home, whose sketchbook was her only escape from a violent father. Within one night, her drawings showed in reality and saved her, and now they use this power that fights those who would do evil. Both live action film and hand-drawn animation combine to create a unique and original experience that will stain your soul and blow you away. Music is also incredible, it really embodies an emotional experience and draws you deep into conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated Erica Langworthy, starring beautiful Marissa Parness, with the music of Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bor.
