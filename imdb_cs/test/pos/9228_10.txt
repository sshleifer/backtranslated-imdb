I found this movie on one of my old videos, after "Godzilla versus Sea Monster" (which should give you INSTANTLY an idea of ​​its tone) and I didn't see it for a while, so I decided to watch it. I didn't remember much about Rainbow Brite, except I liked the cartoon and it was cute. Most people feel this way about her. You'll probably do it. Well, when the movie started, I was wondering if it's the right one! As I remembered her, she didn't fit into the form of Rainbow Brite. But it turned out to kick his ass! It must be the strangest animated movie EVER! I can't believe these characters were so popular (the series isn't very different) while I'm so bizarre. Once I watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites. I really don't want to go too far. Just know that if you see a movie in a video store, rent it and watch it. No questions. You'll get a kick out of it. Especially outrageous princess character. And a robotic horse. And hypnotized elves. If you don't know, it's a 80's cartoon that is actually a "head" of the movie! Have fun!
