Another period work for Chen Kiage ... (can't remember doing a modern movie!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of the HK combat scenes, or Hollywood type heroes, but it's good for that. The characters are strong, I really felt them. <br /> <br /> Understanding the mandarin certainly gives the English subtitles a border. The movie is 3 hours but it didn't feel it.
