The film is a remake of the 1956 BBC series "My Friend Charles" and as such gallops through the material in a relatively short time. I found it fast moving, pleasant and unpretentious. where was John Mills gasified? - the manufacturers obviously decided to skip the scenes - maybe censorship? - but they noticed a deep breathing as they sat at the apartment window, closely followed by similar scenes with an open car window. All the Francis Durbridge series have lived in the same universe, inexplicable events, people are not what they seem and the villain is someone close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some ways, but one with its own rules and regulations.
