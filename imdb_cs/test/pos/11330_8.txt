Two hours ago, I watched this great movie that impressed me with his imprisoned photo. It is quite understandable how he won the Best Cannes 2000 Award. Close window walls, people and many other things. Warm color lighting (which is usually also the director) has given the film a warm atmosphere. In most of them, only two people need to be seen. The film was accompanied by interesting music and especially three songs or motifs. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were extended moments or serious shots. Not only Tony Leung deserves awards for his outstanding performance, as Maggie Cheung was also great. I wonder how many clothes she wore in different scenes. The story was also somehow related to the history of Hong Kong and the 1960s. This made it impossible for me to understand some of the details, especially at the end. In short, I would recommend fans of art films to watch them at the cinema.
