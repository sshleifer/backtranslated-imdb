This film moved me at the age of 39, as all my shots and Dogtown coverage influenced me when I was 13. For all those who have criticized their own promotion of conversations with boys Z, they have the last laugh on you. That was their whole deal, "we are better than all of us and here's why ... (insert shots of the smoothest carved pool you can imagine)" That was a movie that told its story and that was their story you like it or not. It was their opinion of their skating that it mattered ... not yours or mine. I thought the film captured their attitude and influence just as I remembered it in the 1970s. The fact is that the DID revolutionized skateboarding, stimulated extreme sports, and DID injected a cultural paradigm that came to every corner of America. This film brought the rebirth of Bertleman's pictures on the wave, and Alva and Jay Adams tore apart the coping that was California's dream to the whole culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and get advice! When I watched this movie, I realized that it was these images that I lived with every day until I was old enough to move back to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five. As long as I couldn't go back, my friends and I stood up and smashed the ramp down the ramp, looking for every empty pool and imitating everything Stecyk was interested in about these guys. We are all educated and have a family and a career, but this film reminds me who I was at that age and why I still surf. This is an inspired film that anyone who is interested in pop culture culture, extreme sports, the 1970s or even just about making good documentaries will enjoy it. Whenever it comes to the cable, I can't change the channel. Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful work of art!
