I've never forgotten this movie. All those years and that stayed in my life. I've been looking for this movie on many sites and stores. If someone reads it and has a copy, I'll pay you for a copy or let me know where I can find it. This is a movie that should be known as classic romance, as well as my other favorite, somewhere in time. It was really brilliant. If the true actors would make this movie and give it the Patience it needs to be the right actor, it could be a buster block. And Love Story as powerful as it should be for all lovers to see. I remember being sad at the end and really going like a shock. I believe in the heart that Johnny really loved this woman and woman. That was one amazing movie and it's a shame it's not available to us. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to thank my beautiful lady who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film and was kind enough to send it to me. He's a great fan of this movie like me. With her help, there were 3 happy ladies to receive these DVDs. He is waiting for the book he is based on. I checked with her a local library called "Maitlands Affair, Margarett Lynn." I'm sure it's also great. Thank you Julia for her kindness and friendship. I'm always your friend, / Sharon
