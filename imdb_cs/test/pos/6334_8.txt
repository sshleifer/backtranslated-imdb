That's a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Lots of people love it and it's brilliant at creative level. Most episodes have no dialogue, which is such a great idea and "Hush" can handle the silence really well. Plus, this episode presents Taru, which I like a lot. But I don't like Riely or Initial or Maggie Walsh and they seem to have a lot of time on the screen in "Hush". Plus, I don't think gentlemen are so scary and I'm tired of watching the float around Sunnydale. I know I am a minority, but I tend to move quickly to the "Hush" section. Of course there are other parts of the episode that are, in my opinion, great, so if you watch a DVD, I recommend seeing this episode. It's really a classic. "Hush" revolves around the city and loses its voices. The scattered-looking demons called the Lords come to gather seven hearts from human sacrifices, but they die when they hear a human cry. So they steal the voices of everyone in the city. Buffy and Scoobies are trying to figure out what's going on, while Initative is also starting to investigate. Meanwhile, Xander realizes how much Anya means to him, and Willow meets a witch named Tara. Buffy and Riel finally find themselves face to face as they fight the masters. They're both amazed at what they're learning ... She's a squad and she's a Slayer. Finally, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with the new knowledge of Riely's secret life. Indeed, "Hush" creativity cannot be seen in the basic outline of its plot. It's a great silence episode that makes it so great. Characters try to communicate in different ways (White-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc.) And everything works really well. After a while you forget that there is no dialogue because they are so good at expressing. During "talking" parts of the episode, there is a lot of references to the importance of really "hearing" each other. Anya says Xander won't really talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander's protests and insists that Spike move to Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "oil" for "patrolling" when talking to Riely, so she won't have to explain her call. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riel really really learned the truth, they sit there and have nothing to say. It's all fine. There are lots of good parts to this episode. I love people still forget they can't talk. Buffy and Xander are trying to use the phone. Riley cannot use voice recognition in the Initiator elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would do if they had no speech at all. And I think it's funny that Spike has to move with Xander. (They will also share the apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childhood that is just cheerful. I also like the start of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see how they begin. On the other hand, I don't understand how gentlemen choose their victims. They seem to float around the tracks and pick random people. I also don't like Riels. I never liked him, but from "Hush" he almost waits for Angel to return to town and beat him. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? Looks like we've met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's fine ... and then suddenly fell. I do not have it. <br /> <br /> My favorite episode part: Giles' "Who are the gentlemen?" lecturing Scoobies. The whole scene is amazing and its over-heads are just fun. He makes some similar looking flashcards in Season Seven "First Date". Whenever Giles starts drawing monsters, it's just fun.
