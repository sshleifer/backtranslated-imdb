I recently came across the TV show "Passion ...." (when missed the opening scenes). Mrs. Currier is to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring the special story of de Balzac to the screen. I am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in making such a fine film. It must have been a strenuous shooting of so many scenes in the desert. And I can't understand how her coach coaxed the gentle "performance" of leopard Simono. (This ad calls for another exciting adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why isn't this movie better known? I hope to find him on video.
