Though the Cover Girl plot is very fragile and tired, it serves well enough as an anchor for Kern and Gershwin music numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth decided to play in this musical, which appears to be adapted for her. Besides being as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was borrowed from Columbia's MGM, will deal with her in the dance and sequence, where she caves with her own shadow. Auxiliary characters were also competently acting. Personally, I didn't have to use Cover Girl as well as Hayworth with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still very fun and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
