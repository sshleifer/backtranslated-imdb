Cooley High was actually a comedy drama. It was a reflection of high school life throughout the day. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. Between 1976 and 1979 and much of what was in Cooley High, Coolidge was every day. After the movie came out, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High". Getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, party basement, and fighting, it summarizes college life for many in D.C. back in the day. I must not forget Motown because Motown's music began and ended many days back in the 1970s. The hits still appeared. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity over crazy because when everything was said and done just like in Cooley High my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And just like the characters in Cooley High there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing every day to the full from home to the seventh season. Thirty years later we are going to celebrate these good times. Cooley High is definitely a piece of time that just gets better over time because the only thing left of those days is memories, some good and some bad.
