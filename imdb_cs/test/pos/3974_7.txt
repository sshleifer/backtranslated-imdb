(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long) finds herself without a college attend. He was able to speak and speak out of all the problems he encountered, but he was unable to pass the spell of his journey to the college of the admission committee of eight colleges. His mother and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby was not admitted to college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college he won't have any future. Some of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation that they have been rejected by all the dormitories they turned to. To satisfy her parents, Bartleby comes up with the idea to start her own college with a website. They transform an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the website states that we do not accept anyone. On the first day of school they have an unexpectedly large number of admitted students who were also rejected by all universities. With a million dollars in tuition fees, Bartleby must make his fake school operational. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as a college dean. Entertainment begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and all night. <br /> <br /> (My Commentary) The foundation of a college without a teaching staff is a bit off the wall. Because it was a fake school, Bartleby really didn't need an employee. The film reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", college settings, fraternity, lots of gags and pretty young women. These new college students had a different idea of ​​what this was all about. The film not only has a lot of humor but also good news for life. People should achieve their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not be content with what other people want to do. The end was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was created for a young crowd to have some fun. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:32, rated PG-13) (7/10)
