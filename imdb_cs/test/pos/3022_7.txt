After you've seen enough movies, there's very little to remember other movies. However it was an observable, somewhat disturbing film. From time to time I had to turn it off and go back to it later. Just as the "lamb silence" is the search for a serial killer who has kidnapped someone and limited it to his chamber of horrors, as the "Flatliners" the main character examines the world of dreams through experimental procedure. Sequence Dreams Surrealism is what makes this movie because man finds characters in a situation and landscape that can literally happen to anything. And besides this continuity and "meaningfulness" is not needed, which is also a film dream. The only thing that seems to be a little off is the fact that at the end he hopes to redeem the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. In fact, you feel compassion for a little boy inside a man, but apparently the boy's innocence cannot be separated from the terrible actions of this man. Focus is swinging because it has to save a man to save his victim.
