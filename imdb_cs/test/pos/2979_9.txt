Great movie! The soundtrack is amazing! Very relaxing sound. Elton was still in 1971 before his own time. Lewis Gilbert did a great job and directed this movie! The film was romantic and the breath of fresh air. The soundtrack written by Sir Elton has complimented the film on T. Rex Morris's great work with Tenor sax on "Honey Roll" and Richard Le Gallienne's "I Meant To Do My Work Today" was incredible! Kudos to all involved with this fantastic movie! Not surprisingly, many of the people who dealt with this film became the best in their field.
