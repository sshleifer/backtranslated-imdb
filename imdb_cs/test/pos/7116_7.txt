Dracula House works from the same basic premise as the Frankenstein House of the previous year; these are the three most famous Universal monsters; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and Wolf Man appear in the movie together. The film is, of course, somewhat messy, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that sixty-seven minutes of the movie is not bored. Obviously, the idea of ​​making another monster mash came into the writer's head before a real plot because the yarn we gave is not exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. House. Edelman and ask for a cure for his vampire. What can only be described as coincidence is Lawrence Talbot, a.k.a. The wolf turns and asks for a cure for his suffering! It turns out Dracula is hunting for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out he can't stop to turn into a wolf, the wolf plunges into the sea ... where he finally finds a Frankenstein monster. Overall, this film is not as good as the former Frankenstein house. The 1944 movie puts its conspiracy together better than this record in the series because the plot here doesn't provide the same time for every Universal monster. Dracula's plot is greatest at first, but it will soon dissolve only on the surface. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never evolves, and is basically just another version of the conspiracy that always finds itself. The Frankenstein monster is given by the coldest hand, as it only appears in the film as an additional idea and a clear apology to ensure that all three monsters appear in the film. The story of a physician who binds all three together is the most interesting, but that is a bit disappointing because there is no reason why people will see this movie. Acting is good enough, with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do and Onslow Stevens proves the true peak as dr. Edelman. Overall, this movie won't do much for anyone who isn't a Universal Horror fan; But as silly monster movies go, House Dracula is worth seeing.
