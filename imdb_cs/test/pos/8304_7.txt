I like the memory of it when I watched it. It's one of those movies you know it's a waste, even if you're a child, but at that age you overlook ridiculous acting, special effects, and conspiracy (so there's a big drug addict who lives underground, huh?) Enjoy campy monsters for everything that is worth it.
