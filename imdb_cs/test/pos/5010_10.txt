After seeing the Talk Show premiere series with Spike Feresten, I took a moment to really remember that after 12 years there were really good shows besides SNL, and I was also sorry it was only 30 minutes. His great writing skills helped the exhibition overcome the lack of money and helping hands. Electronic Lincoln was cheerful and I think it will be a good show for Dark Horse Talk Show. I was very pleased with how he did it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. How would you suspect it was a little shaky, but it was very good for this kind of time slot. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're not someone on the weeds or even when you are and you don't have anything more important than watching this great piece and have fun time to do.
