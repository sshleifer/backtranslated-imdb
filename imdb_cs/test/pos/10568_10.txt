The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were very convincing and truly sympathetic in their roles. Imelda Staunton brilliantly played Mrs. Sucksby. Despite being an outrageous opportunist, she eventually managed to sympathize. Rupert Evans played a slime master with pure charm and snark. He was a scene thief. The story itself was very unique, as it was said. Setting up Victorian England featuring two lesbian lead characters was interesting and wonderful. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience involved in the story. The beautiful cast and excellent story made this film excellent.
