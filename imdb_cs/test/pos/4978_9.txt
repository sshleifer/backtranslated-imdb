I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and an "eye for an eye", and this film delivers it in spade. Glenn Ford offered a large ranch in the valley a very low price for his ranch; then one of his ranch hands is defeated and shot to help him think of the sale. When the ranch hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do something, it seems that Ford is initially reluctant to do anything to warn his men not to take things into their own hands. But that's just what to do. I knew this film was about to ignite as he stepped into the parlor and stood in front of a guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite evil actors) who killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialogue with him, Glenn Ford plucks his face and shoots him dead. Some pure piece of justice, kills the guy with the gun that belonged to his murdered beef. In short order, we are treated to let Ford burn the ranch, so his men are entitled to ambush the crew from the second ranch; then Ford and his men kicked out all the horses and cattle from the big bad guy's ranch; then they appear and burn the farm buildings and the big luxury house on the ground. Talk about how to cope. Lots of actions in this movie. There's more to this story than this, but I suggest you watch a movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed again and again what could happen if you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get old-fashioned justice.
