Every episode I saw when I was innocent was stupid. There were some funny looking puppets called "Mitts" who would always discuss childhood things. They would play this song before the "Mitts" part of the show that goes like this "Let's Join Mitts ..." Before the meeting, this man would sing "Hot Fudge!" There was a green puppet with teeth, called Seymore. We would always see more Seymore. He would crack jokes and sing every episode. There was always morality in every episode. One episode, the man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode he sang about sharing and care. Seymore told me about the two girls "Sharon and Karen." Part of Hot Fudge Holey Moley has this man doing weird things and playing strange music.
