"I know I'm human. And if you were all this stuff, then you would attack me now, so some of you are still people. This doesn't want to show up, it wants to hide inside. It will fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable in open space, if he takes over, he no longer has any enemies, no one has killed him, and then he wins it. ”John Carpenter's“ The Thing ”is one of the funniest horror movies he ever made "fast, clever and pure exciting from start to finish. All the films of this genre should be created. <br /> <br /> The film, which takes place in Antarctica in 1982, focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. no introduction to their mission, but they are drawn into their existence when a few seemingly crazy Norwegians appear in their base camp, chasing an escaped dog, the Norwegians are killed and the dog gets into the colony, which is when things start crazy. Soon it became clear that "dog" is actually a shift of the shape of an extraterrestrial organism that manifests itself in the physical form of its victims? in other words, it starts to eat Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining people can't discern the difference between their friends and enemies <br /> <br /> a package of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), \ t , using wits instead of rushing. If the Thing is truly among them, how should they go to reveal it? How many things are there? How can a thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?) <br /> <br /> The origins of the animal in the film are easily explained: Thirty thousand years ago, the spacecraft dropped to Earth and was frozen on the ice of Antarctica. The thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice of the Norwegians who unknowingly released him from his natural prison. "The Thing", the movie itself, is similar to the iconic movie "Alien Ridley Scott" "(1979). Many comparisons have been made? The protagonists are stuck in a barren area, watching rarely seen by an enemy who can kill them." However, "The Thing" for all practical purposes? came first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story "Who's Going There?" John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under a pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a production production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The idea that Thing is capable of adapting the physicality of someone is what makes this film so great and the most important reference to the story. In 1951, special effects were simply too poor to render sensibly organi Shape shift, but thirty-one years of advances in SFX have easily become a kitschy gore-fest into a surprisingly frightening (and realistic) confusion of blood and fear. The thing, though it never actually takes one particular form, is constantly seen in the morphing phase and the effects are simply excellent. After twenty-two years, they're still packing. Ennio Morricone (nominated for the Razzie Award at the time) is a bit of an electronic and tinny, but when used correctly, he is scary. From the fact that his cast is entirely male, his end is one of the most provocative and atypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing"? by any standards? is unconventional Hollywood. Not surprisingly, at the time of his release, "The Thing" was playing badly in theaters and "E.T." ?? released the same year and featured a much kinder alien? became a higher-grossing image of two (by far). In the long run, however, the "thing" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's story is outdated and failed during his 20th anniversary of Re-release. "The Thing", on the other hand, gradually climbed the ladder of the iconic classic? it is one of the most famous non-famous films ever made. Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career? of his amazing "Attack on Precinct 13" (1976) on the Spectacular "Halloween" (1978) on Disappointment and Silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "Thing" remains his best film. Although his reputation over the years has never been honest enough to land that place on most "super movie" lists, "Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ??? after a thorough inspection ?? masterfully crafted. Is it a bold and brilliant thrill-ride that is both unique and cool? a real relief for film enthusiasts who are tired of the same old horror gossip. He is at least truly unpredictable.
