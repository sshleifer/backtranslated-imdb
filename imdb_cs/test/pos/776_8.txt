"Driving Lessons" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet their heads when Grint's character comes in contact with Evee, (Walters), slightly outpaced by the out-of-touch actress with the ego. Grint betrays her mighty and over-Christian mother (Linney) and travels with Evee to Scotland to accompany her on her way to reading poetry, which she thinks might be her last, because of illness. Grint's portrayal of a teen in a cage, washed by a brain dominating and even hypocritical, is the masterpiece of this film. His portrayal of an oppressed young man in search of his true morals and happiness is captivating to see how he unfolds. The film is sharply shot, and is well paced, with very few moments leaving you tired, successful, especially considering the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs her characters with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things, emphasizing the ironic immorality of Linney. Her role in "driving lessons" is fun and unforgettable in every sense. The plot is going pretty nicely, so viewers are cheering on the Grint as they chase back to Evee during his lunch break during his stint at the local bookstore to apologize for his guilt. Values ​​in the work continue and are consistently pulled out until the last campaign. The overwhelming (and relief) main idea is that religion does not lead to happiness, and certainly does not lead to morality. The audience is sympathetic to the radical, but loving Evee, with her and Grint on the big screen they have been irresistibly involved and have taken over directly from the debut in "Harry Potter". Charismatic and beautiful acting along with a solid and factually stimulated scenario to make it necessary to see this Christmas.
