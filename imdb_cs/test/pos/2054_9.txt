I've never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable television and I don't understand why. Geena surpasses Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA killer who is brainwashed and has an identity as a teacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. In this life she continues for 8 years with her husband and daughter. Traces begin to come to her that she might be someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have found that she never died and wants to make sure she does. He hires Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they form a couple that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Geena finally gets her memory, she undergoes a transformation into a killing machine she once played in "She's not there". What follows is Geena and Samuel must go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. For the rest of the film, Geena must decide who she really is. Killing an insensitive machine? Mother / teacher with a quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the villains caught Geen's daughter. Great action scenes that rank among the Die Hard!
