I've seen this movie many times and I never get it wrong. It's about a man coming out of a closet that doesn't know where he is. Kevin Kline has the character of a teacher, and when one of his former students announces that Kline is gay, people in his town are speculating whether he is straight or gay. Kline begins to wonder if he's straight or gay. The whole cast is absolutely fairy and cheerful. I found the movie very funny and cordial. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and you feel good about watching. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a great time to watch it.
