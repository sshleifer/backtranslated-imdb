Was it with who took you when you were young? I want her out of your life? The woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she is sick or well. But at times it can be aggravating. Especially when it becomes very prevalent. So Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal with "Throw Momma Fron The Train". His Momma (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He is trying to be a writer and is grateful. He calls him "clumsy shit", "larda $$" and "fat" and "stupid". For her friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), she has her own female problems, her ex-wife. He tries to discredit him. What did Owen do? Push it overboard. What does? Help to return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! I liked the kitchen where Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty." And Momma said, "You don't have a cousin Patty!" and Owen screams "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with Pan. Then comes the fun part when they are on the train and try to kill the Momma Lift. It's thwarted, and Larry gets off the train. Well, everything back to normal, ex-wife lives, but Momma kicked her bucket on her own. Maybe she should see the mistakes of her native way. The fun movie is and the cast is great. Classics! 5 Stars!
