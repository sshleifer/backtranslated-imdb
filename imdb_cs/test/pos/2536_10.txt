This is a difficult movie you are watching and it would be even more difficult if I knew that the actor playing the protagonist was actually killed in his home by the police at the age of 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street boy in Sao Paulo caught in a trigger trigger murder he did not attend. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation, which ordinary citizens hardly believe to exist. When he finally escapes, he and the three comrades survive the only way they know, which is a crime. What makes a film so heartbreaking is that both Pixote and the actor who embodies it do not want to be confronted with life circumstances. Pixote tries to trust and love and connect, but there is simply no room in his world for the subtle side of human nature. One is at the end of wanting desperately to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building more prisons with higher walls is certainly not the answer ...
