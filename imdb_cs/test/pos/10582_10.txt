Well, let me break it ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest nonsense movies you'll ever see. It is a mixture of a unique story about a guy who has problems with girls and everything that goes back to him, combined with the myriad of humorous scenes that will make you laugh in the whole movie, basically if you saw a jackass or CKY series, what to expect from humor because it has most people of those movies. Overall ... I had to give him 10/10 because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard's Rules!
