I suppose it depends on when a person first sees a movie when their impression is created as it is. I saw it as a kid on television in 1973 when it was a Stranger and I loved it. Such was the time when the moon's space program was a reality when shows like "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a child of twelve of what the world could hold in its future. Adventure and technology. You just have to see the show once and it was when the network was broadcasting it. The only way people could interrupt your performance was to make it their own parody; They didn't get to get your show and add it to their own comments over it. I didn't know what this term "pilot" was. I saw the movie and I was hoping Stryker would return home; he did not know that there was a possibility that he would continue after two hours. Back then, I would understand what so many people hate the movie now? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? It is not really for understanding the story, one cannot see it from their perspective but rather from the characters in the film. If a person looks like an American, it can be funny about the lack of security in the police state ..... but if the subject is in this state, then compliance can be expected and safety can be lower. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to the extreme, perfect that there is no doubt, then it is unlikely that the question is so fast when things are out of order. Subplots of film is interesting as an old man who remembers the time before, but watches his words because he suspects there are spies everywhere. Or the police state evaluates the knowledge to some extent because they are careful how they control or damage their brain power. These days it is likely that one knows exactly what the film is about before seeing it, so much tension, surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange if one considers that this film went well in the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that it crashed in the USSR. He gets into the film before it turns out that this is the least of his worry. This is the primary difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". These can be considered timeless, because all the comments they have about the USSR are fairly insignificant and are soon lost in the film. In the first case, these links are through the film, allegedly right at the beginning, and then as a theme of variation over wards. All that has been said, despite my memory of the movie, is quite easy to find out that it wouldn't do like a show. Stryker would be friends every week, Benedict would chase, Stryker would get away. Finally, Benedict's company would get rid of him. Someone else would take the chase. Rut develops. There might be something new, such as another Stryker crew member, but it would probably not be enough to keep the show going. As for the knives that others have used to cut the film, the chances are they will also break it. But if someone remembers that this was happening during the Cold War and what other party's concerns and estimates were at the time, what the popular environment contains for the viewer, there will be some fun and intellectual themes.
