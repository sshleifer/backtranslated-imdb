The fact that there is so much fuss is ironic because the program's aim was to highlight how the media treat such "taboos" as pedophilia. a set of news, suits, smug moderators, a scene of men on the scene screaming about things you see behind them, nonsensical charts and statistics, the whole thing was satire, a very funny satire. The way a c-list celebrity will say absolutely nothing if their agent says it will be good for their career ("there is no evidence for it, but it's a scientific fact"). It may be hard to watch (with a mild peg and cambridgeshire girls, as well as 9/11), but satire should be challenging and we shouldn't be afraid to face the apparently impending scary and subtitling grabbing media just because it's sensitive matter. As the show failed to win any television award for being intelligent, observing, courageous, acting and thinking that provocation is shameful, but when you watch it, it will show you, not least surprising.
