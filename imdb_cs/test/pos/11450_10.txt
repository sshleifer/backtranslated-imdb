I neglected this film when I went to the movie store, but then I got a curiosity and decided to check it out. I loved it !!! The film starts with Judy and Jay heads for a Halloween party at the abandoned Hull House funeral home. Then we meet some other characters, Angela and Suzzanne (hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Salem and Helen. Then, of course, they start the party and when they are really in the mood they decide to have a session that wakes up the demon. The demon has Angela and she begins her terrible defeat. They will survive the night of demons. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was great. Gore was fine, but the nudity that Linnea Quigley (Trash of ROTLD) added would screw her again. I've never been her fan and will never be.
