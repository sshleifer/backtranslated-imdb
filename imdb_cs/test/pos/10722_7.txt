Since I was "Midnight Cowboy", I've been watching movies with Dustin Hoffman and mostly I wasn't disappointed. Since I've been watching "Kramer vs Kramer" movies with Meryl Streep and mostly I wasn't disappointed. In the decision, Sophie did a great job, one of her best, and I took her to "Out of Africa." The fact that these two actors met more than twenty years ago on "Kramer vs Kramer" was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. For divorce everyone has a bad time, even though the children seem to suffer the most ?????? .. Beautifully crafted by Robert Benton in some original directing featuring some unforgettable scenes: even the corridor takes on character and should be included in the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), it's just amazing. How do you get an eight-year deal? Benton did it, and of course with Hoffman it seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, cute and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must be among the best performances of all 5 or 6 children. The best thing, again, was nature, there wasn't going to be over the top, so often these days. This movie came again on a small screen at night, even though I had it in my video collection of years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. Around 7Â½ of 10.
