Fantastic documentary. Film in film. I'm so glad he forged after his mother's death. You are interested in time and money spent in therapy. What could happen if she didn't have the outlet? Did the therapist help her or just support the addiction that kept the bank account flush? The audience must understand that divorce has been fewer options these days. She was a housewife - she went to therapy instead of going to college or work. The situation seemed to be trapped. I wonder if her therapist ever tried to think about what she could do to change her situation and free herself? Meanwhile, No. 2 was just the opposite. She was out there working with Dad. she ended her bad marriage, supported herself and seems to be a very confident, giving person. Whatever the condition of the marriage, the Blocks did something right in bringing up 3 children who could look at their parents' stories, be fine with them, and share them with us, and perhaps lead us to talk to parents and spouses.
