Behind the clouds is a very beautiful, elegic work of art. The overall softness of the light into which this film is mixed is needed to touch the screen. The autumn mood conjured could only be achieved by a director who has seen many years of experience. Or, in other words, an old man. I know of no other film to capture and use the subtlety of light and seasonal mood with such stunning quality as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all people in this movie are beautiful if your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is not a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. Dialogue does not matter much, not that there is a lot, and forget it about the storyline. Some movies exist only as visual experiences, that's one of them. Don't bother if you want "easy fun" that's not for you. <br /> <br /> I could excite the visual perfection of this film for days, but I won't. If you are interested in cinema, photography, film directing, etc., check out this movie.
