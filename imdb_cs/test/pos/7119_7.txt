I'm really impressed. I expected a jolly player humor and nothing else. OK, there's a ton of pretty weird humor. But the movie is so good. Acting is pretty good. Dialogue while a cheese player occasionally, I think, to take care of the player's crowd is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even, dare to say, great. <br /> <br /> When a female player who has built this type of non-traditional fighter type, rather than the usual (min / max) type, gets all these other attacks (it seems, I haven't checked the rules,) it was fine . Kits are amazing for what must be a fairly low film production. The story moves to the right. Transitions from the game world to the real world are well done. A woman playing a female character would sometimes be played by a woman and sometimes by herself. I thought it was smart. Whoever decided to play with a woman but forgot he was a woman was good for a lot of laughter. He even said that in one place, and the woman went to play the role (sorry, I didn't look her name, she did a great though.) The guy always tries to "get some", got a little boring, but I think it was another humor for player. <br /> <br /> So much about the movie. Cheerful. Entertainment! Very well done and I say as a movie fan, not a player (and I'm not a D&D player.) As I said, I expected much less. <br /> <br /> Movies often don't keep my attention, I end up listening while working on a computer. This intrigued me. I can't give the movie much more praise.
