We highly recommend to all who appreciate watching movies. Great acting performance, totally unreal, awkward humor, necessary prison sh-t, accurate representation of the male state. Music is also a spot-on. I think the artist is "Dip", but he's not sure. The short loop of the cover title track on the DVD menu is well timed and sounds like Slint. (One thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of MINIMUM comments based on, not CHARACTERS, not WORDS, but rather LINES. Measuring the quality and amount of LINES-based contributions in the bold era of UNICODE and flexible, web-based typography is like smoking poles.)!
