I loved it, it was really awful and disgusting. I thought the tearing of the human body was thoroughly provacative. The way the human cross depicted Jesus Christ was really interesting. Tearing the limbs and jaws was amazingly brutal. Don't look at it, if you have a weak heart, you wouldn't be able to endure it.
