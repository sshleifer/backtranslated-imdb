I don't know why all critics say it was a bad movie, that's one of my favorite movies of all time. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a great match. Tommy is the stupid guy who spent seven years in college, finally with D +. Richard is a clever kid that everyone at school hated. How can you not laugh when two of them passionately sing "Superstar" and suddenly the hood emerges? It's all a great movie, I recommend it.
