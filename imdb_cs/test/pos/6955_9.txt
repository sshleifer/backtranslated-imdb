Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derived world of independent film. First, photography is a pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the gloomy beauty of northern New England in late autumn (cinematographer Paul Ryan made Unit 2 on Malick's Days of Heaven). Secondly, the performances are equally excellent - Noel Lourdes Ripa Torna is tremendously charming and Tanor Cardinal's Bangor is suddenly sensitive and exuberant, saying nothing about the subtle supportive cast. Overall, however, it is a tribute to the narrative power of the film, that the story keeps a strong and lively move, while it continues to develop in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion that is natural and true, but which does not seem to be expected. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of intersection between people and history.
