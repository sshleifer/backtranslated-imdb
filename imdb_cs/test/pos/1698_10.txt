Is there a full moon today? ACH! It doesn't matter that they can change at any time when they want this medicine! What did I think if there was a full moon today?! Gez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, tension, horror, and hot stuff;) I like the first half of the movie when that guy saves the girl from killing herself bungee jumping and catching her. That was really cool. The setting of this film is in the city of love, which is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, giving you chills not knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of the seat are really great. They even got me into such scenes. His friend, who died, and the girl he killed in the graveyard, but still pointing at the lead character (sorry for forgetting his name), was really fun. The actors did a good job and make-up crew. When everyone said goodbye to an abandoned church, I can't believe that people could, because even if it is a deserted church, it is still God's house. I bought this movie a long time ago, and I don't regret buying it. I'm a horror movie lover. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and love movies like this, try it, maybe you like it.
