Rainy day with not much to do. We were surfing the film networks and we found out that they were just starting, so we gave them a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we got involved in the story. His old story of the working class tried to do it in the sport that at the time (1913 I think) was usually played by a rich higher class, but this film was each as interesting as Seabiscuit and it is also based on the true story. <br /> <br /> Acting is believable and casting is great. A. . . . We are not golfers, so please don't miss this one just because of golf. Every single sport would serve a conspiracy because it's about people. Golf works well for this story because of the class resolution and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . It's a good movie. It's good to put it together and it's not always fun to see those who think they're better than the others they took off a pin or two.
