The third part of Miike's trilogy or dead trinity is unrelated to the first two parts because they were more or less mutually exclusive. The Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi shows are once again for the lead, but this time the film pulls us 300 years into the future ... a post apocalypse. Riki plays a tough cop, enforcer for a corrupt city's extreme police policy, and the show plays a rogue who joins a bunch of urban oppressed rebels. The film had to be shot in Hong Kong, while most of the rest of the cast are Cantonese speakers, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognizable faces. There is also an HK stunt crew for action sequence movies that are very cool in HK-via-Miike style. This could be a feed for a terrible low budget B-movie, but in Miike's hands, of course, they become something more interesting. It's a pretty slow, thoughtful movie that stretches and doesn't try to push anything into the viewer's throat. The characters are rounded and interesting and plot an interesting but fairly free framework for the story to be hung up. All in all, a relatively low key effort to action scenes that show Miike's growing ability to direct and choreographies a very nice event. Watching short work with Show & Riki in wire sets is really fun - you can say they have a great time <br /> <br /> The film's final aims to combine 3 Dead Or Alive movies, which is totally unnecessary because everyone is really independent . Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny, and he closes the series pretty nicely. Not so deep or well developed as DOA2, not as nasty and intense as DOA1 ... yet another good movie Miike though.
