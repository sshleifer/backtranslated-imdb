"Dracula's House" is not such a bad movie and sometimes it is decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Dr. Franz Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) in his seaside home, Count Dracula (John Carradine) discreetly seeks a vampire cure. Beginning on a potential blood transfusion treatment, Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives at his estate seeking a cure for lycanthropy. In collaboration with both patients, he finds a possible treatment in a form close to the lab, and after searching the area, found Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) in the vicinity. Dr. Edelmann, who becomes obsessed with revival, neglects Dracula's and Larry's demands and, after asking them to receive treatment instead of working on Monster, they turn on themselves in a climactic showdown. Good News: That was a pretty decent movie. There is one main idea that is completely creative and imaginative. It is the first film that openly proposes the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease, and one that can be converted from human to human by exchanging body fluid, something that would be accepted by later genre work, but rarely as directly. There is even a microscopic image of a parasite that is responsible for this condition. He works on some pretty nicely used ideas and comes as a somewhat clever idea, though some of his designs are a bit outdated. The fact that each creature has at least one standout scene is a nice idea. The wolf has an amazing scene where he turns into dubious members of the search party inside the prison cell and goes crazy. Dracula is the initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying to a prone figure to sleep and then appearing in human form seems really impressive. The monster rampage is well processed and is caused by the corresponding amount of destruction. The big bat, which Dracula turns into, always looks decent once and is quite realistic. It's a pretty decent thing. Bad News: There are several things that weren't that great on this one. The fact that the film combines so many potentially interesting graphs and ideas that it doesn't really know what to do with them. There are several different back stories that need to be linked together and that should be clear enough to mix well and look cohesive. It really has none of it. The plot is somewhat fragile and in fact does not provide any treatment for any of the stars, and instead focuses on one and the other, and then includes all three at the end. The monsters seem to deal with each other for the least reason, which makes it a great distraction. The end is a big downturn once and it seems to have changed at the last minute. There are a few other small things that weren't so spectacular, and to a large extent also contribute to that. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: It's a pretty decent movie and can handle most of the time with a fun style. Nowhere near the classic status of each monster's debut feature, but it's a pretty nice watch for monster and universal movie fans in general. Today's rating: PG: Violence
