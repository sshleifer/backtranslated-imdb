In a big role, Mark Walhberg adores a rock star to the point where he knows all his songs, imitates him and dresses like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his "idol" role in the band, he jumps to the opportunity. However, the role of a rock star may not be what's cracked to make ... and relationships can change .... This movie has certainly hit me as a topic of what you achieve, it may not be what you think it is. Once you get it. Overall, a really good movie with great performances from all casts, as well as two leaders, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. I felt sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depth of what he sank. If someone dreamed of being a rock star or group, they should watch this movie to see that lifestyle, though charming for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you want.
