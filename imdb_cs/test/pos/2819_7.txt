------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- just a few small <br /> <br /> Saw it on the Satilite channel, skipped the first 30 min of the movie, this comment will be short and informative. The film is basically about 5 characters, acting is very bad for afew characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people, but 3 and 3 kidnap 2. This is one of those types of films where the writers try to be provocative or philosophical, mysterious and ... point; But they do their own, personal, lack of thinking that falls terribly short. Just like one of the prisoners who is supposed to be a kind of psychic psychic - it looks, but his tongue can't talk. Writers think that if a nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurly - I unknowingly believe - that viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I can't remember any - exactly as I said. The end was also bad. However, one woman who is in captivity held her role as an old and fairly wise lady, though, like others, she had a lot of clich√©s. So why would I give this movie 7 stars if I thought all of the above? Simple, I give seven stars LISA KELLER - one sexy and $ mama. SHE is FINE lol. I'm a beauty reward, and that's exactly what it is. But don't get me confused because I'm not perverted and this film is not porn in any way. I can't explain anything about her, but I like it. I remember the scene in which the prisoner relaxed and hit Keller while looking for a way out. He tries to get in the way, but he has no chance. She tosses her down, kneels on the stairs and reaches her pants, no panties;). Now, even though AMAZING's ass - and this shot leaves little time for imagination for 30 seconds - I think it was her facial expression that got me. she wanted it, and that look was thinking I was behind it. I'd tear it up! After that expression, I could no longer objectively look at her, I was in love. lol. I'm glad I saw this movie, but if Lisa Keller didn't play the lead, I'd change the channel ... well ... after I saw the scene I mentioned above. I am a fan of LISA KELLER knowing, but it does not seem to be a consistent actor, seeing this 2003 movie is her last. But I was looking forward to another movie with her in it.
