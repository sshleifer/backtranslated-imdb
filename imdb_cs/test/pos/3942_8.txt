This film was adapted from the well-known sutry to Journey to the West, where a monk with his three students search to find long lost books with respect to Buddha's teachings. Although this film is not as festive as previous movies made by legend, it has been brought in romance and funny funny scenes. This real goal of this film revolves around more on a monk who was primarily saved from eating demonic flying creatures. One of his students, a monkey god, managed to get out of battle in time, but they were again captured by demons and thrown into the deep throat of the dragon, locked in this particular dungeon. The monk woke up in a small village where he found Mei Yana (the so-called ugly snake daughter) who fell in love with him at first sight. Though she was ugly, she didn't let her look set aside before he got to him. However, the search for the rescue of his three students soon turns out to be filled with obstacles, and each of them turned out to be worse with Mei Yan behind the monk. Problems crept deeper, and that is where conflicts between relationships get worse. The rest of the story would be available, but just say that this movie doesn't show a typical story book, that's more for those who want to look for a funny and light picture of what Journey to the West and love obstacles really mean. At the very end it would be possible to describe the whole set with just one word, and that is love. The monk went to show the heavenly gates, the heavenly palace, and the Buddha, how love could overcome even the worst fear of all and consider it the most powerful weapon that could be used against any enemy of superior forces. <br /> <br /> Beautifully designed and funny acts await those who buy this ticket. Of course, no regrets, at least on my part, and those who were with me in the cinema that day watched the same movie.
