I can't say I understand it as a romantic comedy because I found out that it was a little funny. I found it cute, fun, pleasing and inscrutably sweet, and when there were some funny moments, I found them to be bitter than bitter comedies. <br /> <br /> I liked it. Barrymore has grown as much as an actress, and it's always amazing to grab it on the big screen, but it also looks good on a small screen. In fact, on subsequent views, I like this more and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedy, then you may be a bit offloaded by the lack of a comic effect with this one, but if you're in it for romance, it's definitely here to find. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.8 / 10 rate from ...
