Chris Morris Brass Eye has always produced a large number of complaints, both from viewers and participants. But nothing he did could provoke more controversy than this. Special specialty from 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the overwhelmingly overwhelmed opera Jerry Springer arrived, the Brass Eye Special held a record for most of the complaints received about any TV program ever aired. The huge amount of complaints that the general public has made towards Brass Eye Special was incredible! Many complaints have been expressed by people who have never seen the program! The subject treated with the program turned many heads, but the message was widely misinterpreted. The report was even lost to some who enjoyed the program. It was not a show that would ridicule the subject of pedophilia. The show was purely about the media and its presentation. Morris is, and always will be, a media satirist. The idea that the program "makes fun" of pedophiles and children who have been abused is absolutely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do any such thing. It only draws attention to the overwhelming and very often silly media hype around this topic. With many of his "Brass Eye" characters, such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows how much media over the blow every little thing about the subject they have created and built, and the result is so funny, if not fun, than anything Morris did before. With his proven and tested formula, Morris is able to deceive several intimate personalities into believing they are working on a serious documentary. In fact, they are made to look exactly as they are. Retarding. All in all, Brass Eye Special must be seen to be believed. And with one opening line, Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it did in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
