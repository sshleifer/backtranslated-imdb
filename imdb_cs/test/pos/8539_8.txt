Ed (coincidentally editor) is hired to reduce horror movies to make them favorable in Europe (where standards are much stricter). However, the film finds movies very destructive and is getting a little crazy. Well, "a little" could be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me first say: best. opening. scene. at all. Man in the office that blows his head with a grenade. His boss then says - with a straight face - "throw out". The whole film does not maintain this intensity level, but it is definitely trying. Take your shotgun, decapitation, clips from "Lost Limbs" (which my friend Jason wanted to be a real movie). The writer of this film invented the idea of ​​a woman who is raped by a beaver and then immediately after she gets shot in the face with a bazooka. This is something you won't find in any other movie (at least I'm pretty doubtful you'll be). <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of this movie is quality. The picture is not as sharp as the 1997 movie, and the sound could touch (though not bad). I thought I was watching the 1980s movie. Although a little encouraging in my mind - the film also had a style of writing and directing in the 1980s: a sense of fun and something extra for the audience. I miss those days. I wish I had more to say, although at the moment I can't think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see it. You saw a box in a video store with an ax that smashes your head ... maybe you've handed it over several times. Maybe you thought it would be cheesy. Pick up. Taste it.
