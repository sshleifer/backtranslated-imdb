Introspective view of the relationship between Hawking and space / contingent time. This film emanates Gallilean and Newtonian laws and there a relationship to Einstein's theory of general relativity. The film is methodically directed, displaying Hawking as well as his work (black holes). Interviews with the family are too long, so his theories and ideas are unfortunately less developed. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack is a perfect match for the film. Only one other man could compose such scary instellar melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). Overall, I would recommend this film based on Hawking's "Wisdom Nuggets" and his adequate explanation of Horizon!
