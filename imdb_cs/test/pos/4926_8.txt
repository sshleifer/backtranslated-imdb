I love the movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = What is difficult to do. This film is one of the best cartoon edits ever. It's not warp characters like other movies out there. Everyone has a character and plays a role! The film focuses on Buster and Babs, who follow the river after the flood (courtesy of Buster) to Plucky on a trip with Hamton. Elmyra running around torturing animals (as usual), Fifi followed her crushing around the autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth went to the movies. and Babs segments that much, though they had some notable dialogue and jokes. I must say that Plucky and Hampton 'Holiday' parts were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also cheerful. I like acting portraits during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part of this movie, again IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movie ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show it to your children one day ... or even to adults alone - WATCH THIS FILM! You will not regret.
