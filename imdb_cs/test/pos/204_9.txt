One of those movies that I became through the Criterion Collection and as usual was dedicated to the change of pace. That turned out to be a great decision. I was almost fascinated by the quality of the film, the story it told, and the way it was said. The almost minimalist feeling of the film with its sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added the whole evocative level to the film. This is a really great movie to spend some time and enjoy.
