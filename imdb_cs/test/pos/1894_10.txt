This film seems a hilarious, experimental, lethargic and skillfully bad choice of celluloid entertainment. But I admire the courage to discard the script, turn on the camera and act crazy. I found adverse appearances, lighting, cinematography, sound and movie laws D 'Urville Martin broke up. From the point of view of film directors, there is a time when I want to leave everything and have fun on the stage. This movie looks like fun. When other film directors ask me for advice, I'll tell them to watch any Rudy Ray Moore movie. She always returns a confused look and asks me why to look at Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capry masters? I laughed and included that you always want to know what to do in the first movie.
