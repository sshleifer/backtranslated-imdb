It is one of the few films that are so overwhelming that it is very unlikely that you would look at it more than once or twice in your life (other examples are Claude Lanzmann's Shoah and Come and see director's husband Elem Klimov - who it covers much the same intolerable territory, but in a very different way). <br /> <br /> I suppose it's as good as it is sometimes difficult to print. It seems to be an extraordinarily obvious Christian symbolism and the recognition that they were active Russian co-workers, ensuring that it was hardly ever seen in the USSR - and of course, post-Soviet Russia has the films of that time very much little interest. I saw it in London at the Russian Film Festival, which appeared at the time of Glasnost (ie probably in 1988) - but it has probably been shown several times in the UK, so there must be at least one subtitle printing. /> <br /> As far as I know, it has never been released in t he west on DVD or video, so if you haven't seen it, your best chance is probably to join a film company and endlessly let them find the press and screen it.
