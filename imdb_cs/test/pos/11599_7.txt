I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is good looking. <br /> <br /> I rate this 7/10 because of its nice time. <br /> <br /> * spoilers forward * <br /> <br /> It has really nice movie moments, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my overall feeling is too long (more than 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogues. And almost no dance at all. Clearly Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared to Chokher Bali.
