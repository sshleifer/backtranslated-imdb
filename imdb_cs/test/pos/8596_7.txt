I never read Jacqueline Susann's novel, but I also saw the Valley of Dolls based on another of her books. In both cases, I thought the film was probably better than the book and would continue to improve with age (certainly against the books). This is because the film focuses more on the specific style of fashion, design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect, The Love Machine offers quite a lot. The set design fits perfectly into the story. And all the characters fit too. They are perfect to complete a well-balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not evolve, it is true, but in this movie I would not want it differently. David Hemmings repeats the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than just a rip-off. He is a fashion photographer, looks visibly aged and seems to be starting to settle slightly. Robert Ryan reprises the role he played at Max Ophull Caught, again is Smith Ohlrig, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this picture and act accordingly, on the other hand he could think a lot about his parts and then devote himself to a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened, it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (a fantastic wardrobe!), Controls every scene he is in, and is involved in two movie highlights: burning a luxury bed and knocking down Hemmings with the Academy Award. Of course, The Love Machine is ironically meant. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon from the pop era (by the way, the movie is slightly kubrickysh). Choosing a TV station to work on top seems to be just a coincidence. He sees love (that is, sexual favor) only as a means of personal development. There are somewhat scary signs of anxious sexuality that are not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated very carelessly, probably not the standard for mayor's movies. Television managers' open cynicism doesn't have to worry about comparing them with other good movies about a topic like Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They produce bullshit, they agree that it is stupid and they know there will be a lot of dough with it. With this movie, I didn't regret spending 108 minutes with this movie and I wouldn't be surprised if it raised a cult following, provided it gave a chance (meaning DVD release).
