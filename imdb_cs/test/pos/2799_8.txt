The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie was to watch it again (because I missed a lot with all the laughs I did). I am European and I have studied abroad and I have lived equally well with Spanish, French, Italian and German people. The movie was full of stereotypes that, more often than not, people p *** off, and reading some other reviews I see it p *** people off. But this film gets stereotypes so good that I can't cause it. Except that the French guy became a drunken animal. The English guy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, offensive, but shining. As well as stereotypes, the film has also acquired the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first she is shy, she doesn't know anyone, she misses home, she doesn't know how it goes. As time progresses, it becomes his home, and when the time comes to leave, it is extremely difficult. They can only understand people's feelings when they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
