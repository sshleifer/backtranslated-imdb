15 PARK AVENUE is the address of "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is sought from the beginning of the movies. "Prof. Ana" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half-sister from Mithia's mother's earlier marriage. The film revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain the imaginary world of Mithi to the viewer through the constant fooling of Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one, but thousands of awards (which I'm sure will have) for this Mithi rendition in this movie. You can see the view of the patient who is written on her face, on sleepy lips and sleepy eyes, from the first scene itself. Rahul Bose did a good job, but despite his importance in life, he was reduced to half the film. Beware of the intense relationships between the characters of the film, Mithi & Anu, Mom Anu & Anu and between Anu and Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). As usual, Shabhana Azmi has done a riveting performance to remember her sister who sacrificed her life for Mithi. The film may not be your usual Hindu potboiler, but it can definitely see people in Schizophrenic patients in a different light completely. Aparna Sen, as usual, brings the film to a different end than any clich√©, maybe we'll figure it out. Hats for her, for this great movie !!!
