Despite the previous reviewer, this is a well-thought-out and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci-fi movies that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their more recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not in the same league as the films discussed here, such as the brilliant investors William Cameron Menzies of Mars, to name just one of the many titles examined, but that is still a remarkably good overview of the 1950s. paranoid sci-fi. Yes, it turns into a WAR OF WORLDS lukewarm remake in the last fifteen minutes; you can turn it off. The rest is surprisingly good and it is nice to see how contemporary filmmakers recall films that inspired them, even if they can't cope with the originals.
