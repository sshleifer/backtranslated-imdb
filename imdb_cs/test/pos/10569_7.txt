Historical drama is one of the areas where the British cannot be defeated. So even though I'm not a big fan of this genre, I can usually be persuaded to watch something if it's British and decent actors. I've never read anything from Sarah Waters, which is of course something I should do. That's why I really didn't know what to expect from this. I hear there will be a lesbian love story, but not much more. While watching, I found it more interesting than I expected. Without being told too many twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. Although it was almost a lot, it took me a while to get everything straight. The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, even though I find it so. a little slower in the last half hour. That could be just me, but I usually have a problem dragging movies after the plot is more or less finished. All in all, it's pretty nice for three hours. I recommend to all those interested in historical dramas.
