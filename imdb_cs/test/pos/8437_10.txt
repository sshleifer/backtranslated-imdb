James Bridges's "Chinese Syndrome" is the first thriller course; model for those who want to make a really scary thriller but don't know how. Most thrillers end up with standard shooting and chase that ends with the villain getting what he / she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard finale is not in some scenarios. "Chinese Syndrome" is an exciting way no one would expect. He has the type of ending that is so unexpected, yet logical. The film features three (then) current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for "Klute" and "Coming Home" respectively) ) and Michael Douglas (1975 best picture for "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Popular in the 1970s, acting so strong and strong that we forget who plays roles and believes that characters are real people, which is indicative of collective the abilities of all three actors who can be stars, but they are actors. <br /> <br /> There is no musical score in the movie, except for a few songs in the background from jukeboxes or TV shows, Bridges won't let the screen It was just like a strike me as the forerunner of the Dogma 95 films that Lars Von Trier started in 1997. It focuses on characters and stories rather than style. The story of a Southern California nuclear power plant. ** SPOILER ** It seems that the accident happened and the film is essentially about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas are trying to uncover the truth. In a way, it is not a spoiler, because the trailer, television spots, video boxes and reviews give up. But this seemingly simple assumption stems from a surprisingly complex moral play, and tension comes from human nature and human activities, rather than from a villain who frames another person (even if it is an element in the film). This is what makes "Chinese Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
