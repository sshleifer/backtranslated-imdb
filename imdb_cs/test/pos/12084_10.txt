I was just looking for "who will love my kids" to buy when I came across these websites and a record that created a colleague Briton! I am a great fan of this movie and would recommend it to everyone. What I found reassuring is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (among other things) and it is also a fear of my thinking whether something happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to marry his beautiful "normal" daughter, but also my special and gifted son. The lack of a home and the ability to relate to people raised with the same values ​​as me is more important than you know. I live here in the USA I haven't met anyone to see this movie yet. So for all of you who read it, if you haven't seen it, try to do so. It is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you have a nice bone in your body, you will cry and beg. Then you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever experienced such an experience or close to it, my heart goes to you. This makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful the thing is to get, just remember that there's always someone worse than you. The amazing movie and what makes it stronger is the fact that it is based on a true story. Do not be discouraged by how sad it is, and at the same time, this film is a warming heart and you feel encouraged to the strength and goodness of humanity.
