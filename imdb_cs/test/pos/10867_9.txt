This film gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a great action movie, but I really think Emil Chow's character is really great, gutsy, but determined to correct the wrongs. Moreover, the main terrorist who is thinking about his revolution is wondering if he does it for good or bad. A movie that tells us about Todd, an Amnesian terrorist who is cheated as a secret until he learns who he is. The consequences of his terrorist family give him the possibility of redemption. Purple Storm was one of the best I saw this year. The film really excels when it is filled with huge action scenes created by Stephen Tung Wai who has won the best action sequences at the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
