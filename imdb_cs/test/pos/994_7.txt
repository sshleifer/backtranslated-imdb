This movie has failed in the UK unhappily and didn't deserve it. The trailer of this movie is somewhat misleading, and I think it introduces critics and viewers into thinking it was "Repentance: Part 2". While the film was launched to take advantage of BAFTA's earlier success, which was won by Joe Wright, it is a very different tone. It focuses on the imagination of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II as a writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) childhood darling Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. It was Dylan's first love in his homeland, but the moment passed and singer Vera just wanted it as a beautiful memory. Or yes? Vera unexpectedly hits a close connection with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, the Love of My Life, Mother of My Child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). Three form a sort of trois threat in a war-hit London, but Vera then falls on a lively soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They quickly married Killick, who goes to war. Frightened Vera convinces Thomas to return to Wales, but three face the realism of the birth of Vera's child, William's jealousy and shock shock after returning home, and Caitlin realized he couldn't share Dylan with his best friend. . Recorded on a low budget, it's more of a mood than anything else. It works best as a recognition that some memories and feelings must be valued but not restored. The performance of Sienny Miller is extremely excellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense of being a talent) and Knightley and Murphy are again very good. Disappointing is Rhys as Dylan, who, while the Welsh poet himself was not a bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. Writing is very jerky, some beautiful moments blend carelessly. It's definitely worth watching.
