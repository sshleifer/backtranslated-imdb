Calling all D-sciples! Take your friends, go to the theater and see the hell out of this movie. From the opening sequence to the credits, you will laugh at your breath. This movie is a wild ride through the history of D, and not just some bull-crap list of things I did, but recording their ascension to power. I'm a huge Rage Kage fan (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so I naturally loved the movie. It helps to know about the show they had and their first CD, but it's just as funny, if not. From cheerful and vulgar texts, rocking rhythms, a huge amount of smoking in pots and portraits to the utter frenzy that is the story, it's a film for D-sciples and newcomers. Many of their songs are referred to, such as Two Kings, Tribute, and Kielbasa to their many audio tracks like Cock Push-ups, every fan in the audience will say I remember it as well as new comers says "It's F 'ing cheerful!.' I highly recommend this film to any body that has ever disappeared. This movie is certainly in high competition for being another "This is Spinal Tap." One of the best.
