I will never forget the totally absorbing effect that this show had on me when I first saw it. From the time the Clown was surprised by the Major, to his anxious attempts to understand the situation ("We are alive, we are human, we must have memories!" To improvise escape means, it is a ravishing drama. <br /> <br /> Little attention remains with The moment when beautiful ballerinas dance for everyone, the key is turned off, the Scottish musician's bagpipes are scraped, Tramp's sad note: "Miss is as good as a mile", Major's shattered conclusion that he must be in hell. <br /> This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and held, and the breathtaking beauty of Susan Harrison contributes to the unforgettable, peculiar story.
