Brightly patterned after the first gangster movies that Warner produced in the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and public enemy (1931), this gangster movie is one of the better efforts I've seen. Although not entirely in the same league as the previous mentioned classics, it has a powerful performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She is spectacular and adds her lines more natural than maybe someone did at the time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage at his stage. Career and shows signs of what will follow in the next few years as he rises to the top. The film has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (never seen him so nasty) and Guy Kibbee (what shock to see him acting like a hoodlum). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very resourceful, probably the first voice that shows people the thoughts appear in this film. If you have a chance to see this little gangster, don't let the chance go.
