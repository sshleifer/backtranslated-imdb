In the DVD era, you think you could find almost any piece of bullshit that deals with celluloid, and for the most part it is true. WHY, WHY, WHY it is so hard to find this great little movie that is clearly done by people who love noir as a loving tribute (a buit that never falls into the spoof country) of most film genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are HOOT in this and superstar-in-the-making of Carl Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) with her now trademark red hot babe / great acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for movie fans. A b noir on steroids, clever and steamy JUDAS KISS will succeed in every count. <br /> <br /> Please release Columbia TriStar PLEASE on DVD soon !!!!!!
