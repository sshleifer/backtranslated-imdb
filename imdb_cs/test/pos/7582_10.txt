I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and pull your audience into the character. Horses on Mars are doing it. When you watch a good movie, you don't want it to end. That's how I watched a movie. It is visually extensive and the microbes take the human qualities that you feel are on the road with it. We are really looking forward to what Mr. Anderson's exciting adventure will take in the future. Great.
