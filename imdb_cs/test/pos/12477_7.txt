Should we open the frame like a weird frame ??? I think we have to. Two women are behind the closing umbrella, go up to the talent agency and go with them ... and then they will never see again. Okay, how come you don't go out on the piano, or even out with the sound of a piano, then watch in and out again, la Hitchcock ??? So I think Clouzot has not told us in a subliminal way that we are following the segment of the post-war society: especially how Citizen Kane = uses a five-piece song to show the lady singing a talent from the agency all the way to her first roses and applause from her Vaudeville debut. Thereafter, we are relentless observers of the more or less small, disgusting details of the defeated country, which has emerged from torn knees. And no one ever managed less resistance than Clouzot. In fact, it was too bad that he never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us a little uncomfortable. .... okay, okay, I overestimate it, let's settle for the general feeling of a lot of film. Look carefully, in fact, and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose. And how many movies someone did. Then there is a very loud nose that throws in front of a lesbian photographer from the chief cop, and notices that she doesn't, literally, blink her eyes or raise her eyebrows. The point of all this is an almost feverish immersion in the neighborhood, seemingly until you feel virtually every scene, just as you see and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others have covered them more closely than I do. But forget the secret: this is the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is interested in the real killer, just like the two women who are coming out of the rain in the first few seconds of the movie and never seeing each other again. From the beginning to the end of everything he wanted to do, it was to watch a lot of people around, even those who were particularly interesting in this area, and say, here to watch the woman's twitch that the man touches his pants in all his insignificance , years and years before Tina Turner sang, we don't need another hero. Even the forced cheapness of the end is bleakly done in a dilapidated part of Paris and a somewhat cold-bare brick apartment. Love for couples only, so that they can see them as if they say there must be two or three million people in the city, as if you had all day long when you want to give a little love at night. From this it was only a short step to the Wages of Fear and the ultimate despair. They don't even know how to make movies like this in the US. They didn't even know how much in France, much less. The inexorable detail of the gesture makes even neorealists Italy bad psychologists. What I think Clouzot is doing to Rosselini on speed. Very pleasant nonsense, this movie. The only mistake seems to me, and as another viewer pointed out, the leading woman is not right. All the others in the movie are just perfectly cast.
