I managed to get the original BBC broadcast of this movie on video and I loved it so much that I had to try to find the original video in its original box; thanks to Ebay. This extraordinary wildlife movie, which has been erased in any format since 1990, is delicately designed and well behaved. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the Scene Jumping Tigers run through Alaskan wilderness is nothing short of overwhelming and its timeless story of a hunter trying to survive on his own in frozen trash with two young tiger cubs moving on each viewing. Why no major company has raised this film for DVD distribution is a great miracle; but it makes it a special special to know its also hard to locate. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by chance or eventually watch it add to your collection, make sure you never let it disappear from your grab. Films of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. A real masterpiece in every sense of the word and very worthy of his praised comments, "WHEN NORTH LID BLOCKS" fit deep as soon as you see it.
