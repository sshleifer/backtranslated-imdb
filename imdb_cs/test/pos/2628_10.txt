Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are excellent in this 1970s melodrama. Fresh setting, scary music and plot plotting make it a really interesting movie. I saw it when he first came out on TV. I aired it once more when I had a VCR, but I had no chance of tape. He will love VHS if someone has a copy. In addition to the tension (which is beautifully processed), I feel that the story is unique, and is largely true to the book, MRS. MAFLAND'S AFFAIR Margaret Lynn. I would say that it was one of the most overlooked best films of 1970 from films made for television. I awarded the film as # 10 because it is done with so much originality. There is a real pathos and air of romance that sympathizes the viewer with the culprit.
