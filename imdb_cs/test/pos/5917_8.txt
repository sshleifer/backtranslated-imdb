It is a thoroughly successful example of a 1950s biopsy. He has a persistent and handsome young hero - not so young on the screen; excellent if unlikely direction Billy Wilder; mixed, fully controlled musical score of uplifting scales and, if necessary, heavenly strings by Franz Waxman; strong supporting players; a stunning story; stunning photography by Robert Burks; and telling of a unique historical event. The film begins with Jimmy Stewart as Charles Lindbergh tries to sleep at the Long Island Hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, from New York to Paris. And she can't sleep. The flight itself is filled with memories of Lindberg's personal history and the purchase and construction of his unique high-wing monopoly, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri, is the home of a sponsored partnership for years. (Even in 1927, money was talked about.) Anyway, the film had to have more flashbacks and Stewart's story. What is the alternative. Observing Unity? Thirty-three hours of Jimmy Stewart's observation sit quietly at the controls of his noisy plane as the days and nights come and go? I found the script and direction impressive for their time. Obviously, unpleasant things are left out in order to avoid introducing more ambiguity than contemporary viewers can handle. My bet is that the howling crowd surrounding Lindbergh in Le Bourget tore the plane to pieces for souvenirs. And of course nothing about the pilot relief tube, though it would add more opportunities for humor. Some viewers today will find some sinister incidents if they think about them too much. Stewart boasts a friendly hacking way that wakes him up quietly in a bustling moment when he lands on his face at a critical moment. St. Medal Kristof, whom Father Hussman gently tapped on the glass crystals of one of the tools, just as Stewart was desperately trying to land. Stewart's atheist is saved twice - one flight and one God. But it doesn't matter. It's an impressive movie. Landing on Le Bourget, with exhausted Stewart for joy, confused by the lights, sweating with fear and fatigue collapse, is truly convincing. "I'm going to rip the plane," he says to himself, and we can believe him. Flying a light plane isn't like driving a car at all. There is no smoothly curved highway to tell you where to go, no lanes to give directions. You're busy every now and then. You have to look at the instruments, check each wing to find that they are touching the horizon, ditto to the nose of the plane, and constantly look up, down and sideways for more traffic, even if the last one was not a problem for Lindbergh. He was all alone over the ocean. Why? In one of the movie moments, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, two 1920s gypsy barnstormers, are lounging at their planes in the Midwestern field. "What is it? What he loves to fly so much?", Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his financial supporters try to get him out of flight. Five other airmen have already died. "But you don't understand? It needs to be done," says passionate Stewart. Well, that's not the answer. Why must he do it now and why Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and stop wasting lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, lies partly in our glands. The pilots are calm and confident because of the occasional excitement. Their main problem may be the dependence on the inner rush of adrenaline. I'm kidding. Some of my best friends are pilots. But Lindbergh had to be quite a man. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not just because of the flight itself, but because of his later appearance - a quiet, humble, family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler because he more than invented him by testing the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to improve the aircraft and get the best performance from them. See if you have a chance. If nothing else, it's a historical lesson with visual splendor.
