Five adolescents went on camping in the Oregon wilderness and, despite warning him of the park guard, he soon realizes that something is waiting in the back forest for a strike. When it comes to old horror movies, the only one that still leaps in every conversation is Friday the 13th, so I took it to find the good old horror movies that were not enough to compare Friday 13th, Just Before the DAWN, so it happened to be among those I found, and was really very impressive, it wasn't as bland as some of the things you find today were very sharp in terms of character development As it had quite a few sympathetic, and it has a very occasional pace, it's not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits, it takes its time to set the right mood and tone and is very atmospheric and puts some killer suspense by that you always have the feeling of horror like, something like out there, but you don't know where it is or when it will be trike. Where I live his definitely overlooked gem simply because people have never heard of it or give them a chance, but I say it's not Friday 13th rip off, these two concepts are not even closer but in my The mind is generally one of the most impressive slashes I've ever seen.
