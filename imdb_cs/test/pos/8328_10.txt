That's as good as it gets. These are the six episodes that follow (briefly) what life can be like when dinosaurs ruled Earth. In the style of a natural documentary, the show is getting rid of talking heads, instead giving us good things with dinosaurs trying to survive. See the screen to prove it with confidence, but its the best estimate and fun to do. Here is a show that brings dinosaurs life in a realistic way that doesn't include eating people. This is a demonstration that should be shown to every child who loves dinosaurs because it instills the OH WOW factor to go out and learn more. It will also entertain the hell out of them, and you. <br /> <br /> See. If you like animal shows or nature or science or the adventures of Disney True Life Adventures (except nobody really kills) or just a really good trip to somewhere else, run out and get a copy. Your brain will thank you.
