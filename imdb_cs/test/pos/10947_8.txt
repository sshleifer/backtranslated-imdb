If you go to the Twins Effect, looking for a pure Hong Kong experience, you'll be disappointed. That doesn't mean it's bad, but it's not a traditional Hong Kong action film running in a similar vein to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's definitely stupid and youthful, so if you want a little more serious action in Hong Kong, check out John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping. This film has a lot of flaky for its stupidity and I thought the first thing I should do would be to explain what you're getting into because it's disappointed with a lot of purists. Purists and those with more forgiving tastes, the Twins Effect is a wonderfully silly kung fu comedy. I liked it a lot for a number of reasons, not least it's beautiful female leadership that set fire to each other in a thoroughly fun comedy twin. I believe this is the first movie of its kind in which they were, but hop, kick and fly around like seasoned professionals. Probably a ridiculous plot is being processed with great care and attention, and the film is quite consciously written, making a lot of movie laugh out loud. Comedy is really the most prominent thing, and it's a subtle, subtle comedy that depends on words like lifeless objects flying la Stephen Chow. It has to be said that the grotesque is extremely fun. The sequence with disco-dancing vampires is quite classic. The action is a mixture of two genres. It falls between the 'season drama' wire-and-sword fight (which comes more to the end) and the comedy fighting style Jackie Chan, coming out with a mixture that although a small derivative occasionally is always exciting to watch and occasionally throw some really innovative encounters. <br /> <br /> This is all great, and the movie is a huge fun all the way through. Despite this, it has several adhesive points. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more westernized than kung fu fans are accustomed to, so the inevitable comparison with Blade series is certainly sound as an example, although Twins Effect is frankly much better than the Blade that has ever been driven, especially for combat action. Personally, it was also a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (hissing bad guy from the classic John Woo Hard Boiled), which is so underutilized, but the younger audience he is looking for is unlikely to notice it or we really don't know about Hard Boiled or his More movies, so it's really just a personal gripe. <br /> <br /> If you are looking at it with an open mind, you will probably enjoy it as I did, but you must be firmly aware that it is COMEDY, not the balls in the kung fu movie wall. Keep this in mind and you'll be fine.
