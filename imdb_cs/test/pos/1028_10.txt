>>> The great news is scheduled for July 31, 2006 in the UK - there is also a planned release in states - I don't know the date - can't wait! ! <<<<< br /> <br /> >>>> Below is my original comment <<<<<< br /> <br /> I agree with all other reviewers - it's just overwhelming that one of the Biggest TVs dramas that have never been released on DVD <br /> <br /> The story of the story is fascinating - acting is excellent and character development is fascinating! Here in the UK we have quite a history of getting TV drama series and movies out on DVD through popular campaigns <br /> <br /> Is it very difficult to understand why rights owners don't go to DVD production? I'm going to e-mail one of the leaders of this movement and see what happens. Who did it? was it BBC? RW
