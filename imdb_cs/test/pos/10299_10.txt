It's an amazing movie: a romantic thriller with an intricate but perfectly constructed and devastating symmetrical chart that is brilliantly supported by repeated visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully shot: women, flats; but the more devastating is the juxtaposition of images, almost every scene has echoes of the other. This is a story told in light, in color, in many almost parallels. Every time I look at it, it pleases me. Acting is also great. Romane Bohringer is overwhelming as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: all about her mood changes. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role in his role in La Haine; but no less great: both handy and compassionate. And Monica Bellucci - ah!, Monica Bellucci, okay, she plays (is she) The farthest woman in the world. There is one small scene of about three-quarters of the road where it makes a smile; Even at this time, he says more than hours of Hollywood waste. One cannot do justice to this film without mentioning the excellent, sequential peak: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this wonderful denouement, whose prospect was ahead of us throughout the teasing story. However, when the moment comes, it is treated so kindly, so briefly, so skillfully that it will breathe out of you. Only a director of overwhelming confidence would dare to underline this vital point. But trust is justified. Cinema doesn't come much better than this.
