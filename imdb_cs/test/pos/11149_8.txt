I recently bought a universal DVD Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, so I was a little reluctant to watch "gold earrings". The idea of ​​something that Marlene Dietrich, as a gypsy in a Romanesque war novel, had had, was unusual and unlikely. I wasn't afraid. With all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's really hard to miss, really. The film was a pleasure to watch; it's a classic. The most interesting thing about the film was Dietrich, who will resign completely from the role of the Roma. Makeup, lighting, photography and its performance make it a really surprising and memorable character. I've never seen Dietrich play a convincingly earlier "good" woman - but she here! In those great Sternberg films, she played a lot of heartless vampires, so it's refreshing to see her on the ground, a relaxed role, to play an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> Very nice romance overall. The love story is believable, optimistic, and happy ending is very satisfying.
