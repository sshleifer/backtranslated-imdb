Sick of contemporary film, especially American cinema, I tried to see Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I came across this gem. Slowly to start, it will rise as soon as the war is declared. Basically an old-fashioned girl-waiting-for-boy-to-return-of-war story, showcase, cinematography make it so much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as a young woman will not become an international star after it is behind me (though she has remained successful in her own country). You set out on a journey with her: a young, defiant young girl who becomes a very sober, dark woman as a result of war wars, holding a glimpse of hope (her last scene is devastating). We love her just like the camera. And the camera! Was it a pioneer in a handheld camera? The story really adds immediacy. And the beauty of it (like when Tatyana's character runs up the stairs and next to the grate fence). I'm humiliated and grateful to have seen this movie.
