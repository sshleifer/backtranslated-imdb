I love so much about this movie: music, cinematography, acting, story and all Mormon clichés. Just because they're clichés doesn't mean they're not true! It's not perfect, it's a movie. Although excommunications take place in well-lit rooms with nice large tables and chairs, it was perfectly appropriate to display it as a dark, cool scene they did in this movie. I also liked the scene with an angel waiting at a bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I think the angels are watching over us. What should one expect while waiting? Smoking is the way some people spend time waiting. I loved the irony because the Mormons agreed on smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake, and shouted every time! She blows me out. And now I watched it 3 times in the video and it kept crying. I'd jump to the chance to see it again on the big screen. I hope that the Tower Theater in Salt Lake will bring it to the general conference on a regular basis, as a cult film (pun intended, but no offensive attack).
