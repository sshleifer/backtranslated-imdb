I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005. I went with the assumption that if Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank were to play it must be at least decent. Well, after some slow start I wasn't nearly disappointed. In fact, I was quite satisfied with the final product. I have to admit that Afrikaans and Xhosa (?) Accented with English by some actors was hard to understand, but like seeing "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or any other movie with heavy accents that I edited after about 15 minutes. And I tried to find out why Hilary Swank was to be South Africa, and it sounded like she was trying to put an accent, but it sounded very American ... as if she was trying to make the accent try. But later in the movie, as more is revealed about her nature and how she moved to the US as a teenager, you begin to understand how she could lose some or most of her accent. So it started to make sense that only certain words could have a Afrikaans tilt to them. I know it's a little weak to use film as an education, but one of the biggest things about this film is that it was interesting to see the dramatization of the Truth and Reconciliation process. I heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid, but I didn't know how it worked. The final verdict is that although some scenes felt a little bit it was a very strong movie overall. The final "truth" sequence was a strong result of every movie she hopes. Some must see anyone who cares about what happens outside their boundaries.
