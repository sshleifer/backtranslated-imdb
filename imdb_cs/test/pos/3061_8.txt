This movie needs a DVD because it's the only way I buy it. I thought it was fun because there was no real plot. It is believed that this is not an Oscar-winning film. I appreciate the movies. Cary Elwes was a very cute Robin Hood. I can't even think about my favorite movie parts because they're pretty good. Anyway, peace.
