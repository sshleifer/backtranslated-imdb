Most people do not realize that this film exists. Fox, who paid the judge, kept him in the can for some time and then didn't promote anything. I think many people thought it was one of the garbage films that had been flushed in late summer. I'm here to tell you it's a witty and somewhat frightening look at the future that isn't so hard to believe. In essence, the judge puts forward the idea that stupid are being bullied by the clever into a wide range. Then these stupid ones are becoming more stupid, basically spending all their time watching TV and sex that produces more stupid people. By 2500, the average intelligence person now appears to be a genius who speaks of "omnipotent". Seriously, it's really that hard to believe. Sure, this future is sorely witty and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time a military guy travels, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story acquires its cult status, it is with numerous witty one-sided, like "we can stylize it with the family" and "hey, man, I'm here!" This is a funny movie and a somewhat sharp social commentary on an American society that seems exhausted with its own pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee that I will buy it on DVD the first day it comes out and watch it. and more.
