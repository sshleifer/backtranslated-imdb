If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. It's really over four and a half hours, but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Claudius is worth the effort. It never ceases to amaze me how bright it is to "Hamlet" when you see it in its length and order as set by Bard. Every movie version of "Hamlet" plays with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passion. Jacoby is able to pull all these aspects of Hamlet's character along with Shakespeare's full screenplay. Hamlet says, "I'm very proud, vindictive, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset not only because of his father's death (and suspected murder), nor his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and above all, because Claudius usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is enraged at his mother for taking Claudius (a marriage between royal relatives is not unknown; did for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg asking it for himself. It is therefore powerless to do anything about it. And that is true even after they hear the revenge of their father's spirit. He can't just kill the king, or he loses the throne. He must "out" the king of mystery and here is a tragedy! At this point Hamlet is successful in portraying Claudius' guilt in public, has the opportunity to kill him and not. WHY? He wants it all! He wants revenge, throne and damnation of Claudius' soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES is in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his atonement. He kills Polonius and thinks it's Claudius and the rest of the spiral game until the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudia and Hamlet.
