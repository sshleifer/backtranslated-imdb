OK ... the movie (as well as the last few films in Segal) goes beyond the "knock", digging in the groin, shooting in the face, revenge against the villains for injuring my sister's cousin. "The things Seagal went to for a while." Geepers, Steven began to think and use his money to make movies with his own ideas in them. Sure .... there are a lot of actions in this movie, but also some thoughts and hearts. It's not an Oscar-winning movie, but it's worth the effort if the viewer isn't so powerful that it's the brain of dead violence that it hurts to think for more than a second. It's worth renting.
