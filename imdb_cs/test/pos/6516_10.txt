I've been watching this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who, at a young age, finds out that when she is praying to St. Anne, her prayers are answered, she lacks a lunch container and an average neighbor praying and praying. that someone should give him a black eye for arguing. A moment later something hits him and has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use this power for good. She is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooks / journals filled with all her friends requirements for St. Anne. Meanwhile, a local boy is coming home from college (I believe) and Sally is amazed how much he is grown up. Sally has a huge crowd on him, but she's so shy. She should use her power of prayer to Sts. Anna for her own selfish desire, or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to capture the men of their dreams? This is a fun movie with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, fraternal, who is a hilariously annoying and sworn Irish neighbor-enemy, who spends a day with grand-pop. He has his own story of wanting to buy an O'Moynes property, a small house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, the O'Moynes House is in the eyes of his beautiful buildings. . This film is definitely worth watching and is pretty good and rare enough to join in its film collection. I hope, you will like it!
