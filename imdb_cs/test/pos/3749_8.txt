A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to find their evasive fianc√©. It is a movie that is very malevolent because it is disjointed, but until then it is an interesting, well-functioning, scary and subtle set design (William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3D projection). Veronica Hurst is a charming and kind, somewhat elegant British Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in her forbidding castle; there are bats in the belfry! She moves quietly until the last extraordinary set, when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the storyteller) emerge from the castle at night to embark on a maze and find what they are looking for in their midst. As a child, I always remembered this succession - there is nothing more frightening (or claustrophobic) than finding a way out of a 10-meter-high hedge maze. Of course, these two women separate and prepare the ground for a thrilling tension with horrible music. The end result is really disappointing, because Carlson's epilogue at the end makes sense to all who go on, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing.
