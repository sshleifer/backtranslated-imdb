Even for science fiction, this movie is a little outside. All right, more than a little ... My first thought after what I noticed was that I lost my mind. Don't watch this movie waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their strange cult standards. Donnie Darko is a past, overcome it. Richard Kelly loves to make movies that make you feel stupid so that you don't understand "deeper meaning" when you first watch. To be honest, I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. Deeper meaning - (to save you a lot of sociological psycho babbling) People are alone, used to make decisions that can destroy our lives and not open mail without a return address. Summary: A haunted old man tells Cammeron Diaz that if you press a button, I kill someone you don't know and give him a million dollars. Of course it pushes and as promised the haunted old gets a case of money. Then the film plunges into an unusual. To save your fingers on typing ... To push a button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural extraterrestrial beings, in a sophisticated experiment that focuses on the morality of the human race. I liked the willingness of the film to ignore the general guidelines for movies. It's different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (though its 101 philosophy material). He lets you guess. DO NOT WATCH Hollywood! I disliked: Why would any technology-based creature that could suppress another form of life invent such a ridiculous scheme? Which god as an alien has patience for it? Diaz was good, but was there a need for a country accent? They live in Virginia. I give it 7 because Kelly has not given as much attention to detail as other movies. Overall a good swing.
