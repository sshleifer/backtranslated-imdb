David "debonair master" Niven plays Big Boss (IVAN), who feeds on the unfortunate Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing hapless ex-con to use his badly found new bank position. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) most effectively provides a woman's interest that Pinkie cannot simply resist. <br /> <br /> They seem to have failed to decide on a single title for this movie, so instead they used four .... it makes sense ??? Sadly, it turned out to be one of Niven's last roles. Overall, this movie is fun and worth seeing if you manage to catch one. his rare or late night TV screenings. <br /> <br />
