Ah external limits. I like the show. It was brutally scary or mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, thriller to mystery, no matter the genre, it was good. I think I had to start watching the road after it was canceled when Sci-fi showed it as a re-run or played marathons. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everyone, but I remember every time I saw the screen get angry and the voice on TV says, "There's nothing wrong with your TV. Try to edit the image. It was a good show, and I like watching it if it comes. I give him a healthy 8 out of 10.
