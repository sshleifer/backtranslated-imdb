This movie for me and my wife is more fun than all the movies that thrive with violent thriller / mystery / murder. It's about real people who do the best of their lives. They just happen to be Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. Realistic acting and great scenery are more than just an improbable plot. The soundtrack is from BC Smith, who also made the soundtrack for Coyote Waits and is great. Adam Beach plays an indigenous policeman who is a bit of an accident prone and Wes Studi is a stoic consumer professional detective. There are many other great roles for Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of Hillerman's novel, and we enjoyed it very much.
