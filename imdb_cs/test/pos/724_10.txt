I've seen a lot of movies and this one totally threw me out. Trauma, tension is just amazing. I ended up like this in psychological fear and philosophy and followed it to reality. Films that play and challenge your mind are films you won't forget, those that challenge you. The problem may be quality, but that doesn't mean the nature of the film. The idea that I am brilliant and the end just totally shocked and with the question for you to seek an answer. I just loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles. One of the best movies ever, hands down.
