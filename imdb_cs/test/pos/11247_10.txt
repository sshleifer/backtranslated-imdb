I'm sure all IMDb Canadians are too familiar with Canadian content and how much of it is ... well, let's say, bland. There are a few Canadian shows worth seeing, but this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> A simple assumption. Two boys pick up girls in a bar with certain rules and rules, add some funny and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly sympathetic self-proclaimed "Alpha Males" and you yourself have very fun programming. Each episode is fixed. If "players" are subpar, there are a few unpleasant moments to be, and there is some subtle fun. If "players" are good, it leads to moments that you just have to get up and clap, and some comic praises that make them. The assumption is that I know and how I know. A guy who usually boasts of being elevated to a typical, terrible TV reality, takes a lot of me to admit that this show is actually fun and entertaining. One thing to emphasize is how The Comedy Network has done terrible work marketing this show. For a long time, I didn't even know it was a place, and all I knew was that there was a hairless guy who "loves bombs". After I really watched the show, I was surprised how surprisingly the Canadian content looks (despite the lame opening sequence). So give him a chance. I haven't yet found someone in the target demographic group (18-30 year old men) who watched the show (and not just the annoying ads) she didn't like. Bring it back for the third season, the Comedy Network. It's actually a good assumption, unlike some other Canadian shows you had (cough * girls will be girls * coughing). I usually book 10/10 reviews for "artwork" but I'm just so fun watching this show and I think it was unfairly judging my many that I just had to.
