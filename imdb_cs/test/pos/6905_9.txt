This film was really a breath of fresh air from a load of Hollywood crap I saw recently. Acting is excellent and characters are engaging and special. There is really not much about the story, it's simple and it works well. Easy movie as you just sit back and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the files really helped make the film and offered some nice visuals. Obviously, the film has aspects of horror, yet it focuses a little more on the humorous side of things. You will not laugh out loud hysterically with this, but you will smile all the way through. Humor works very well with characters and excellent acting doesn't hurt. I really watched this movie because Ron Perlman was there. His role is slightly smaller than I expected, but it doesn't matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to hire you. If you like horror, watch it. If you like comedy, watch it. Go ahead and watch it anyway, it's really great.
