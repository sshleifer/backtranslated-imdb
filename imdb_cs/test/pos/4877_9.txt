I've seen SEA OF DUST as part of the NYC series a few years ago. I enjoyed the movie at the time, so I was a little confused by some of the amendments that have been made since then. Maybe it's my memory, but there were missing pieces of exposure that were missing in the version that was featured at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I really am not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say that I have found something that I would appreciate. Although it has been promoted as a tribute to Hammer Films, people awaiting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula will be very disappointed. There is some cleavage, but no nudity (the core of British production later films). And while SEA OF DUST is filled with wonderful eye candy (it's really shot as a 1960s movie) and includes Hammer Starlet Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's images in tone or design. This movie is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very fun. I do not remember that the earlier version is as dull as this, but it is not a bad thing (especially a clearing in the Black Forest that plays like three Stoogs short). And some of Mrs. Pitt's reproaches are pretty fun. It is as if someone has injured and released it. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, however, is not borrowed in details. It's in thought. As an occasional Sci Fi channel viewer, I regularly take the network to a task for its one-note variation on the subject (a CGI monster kills then it is destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you can start a trip with them after a while. But don't get me wrong. Do not complain. If this is the case, I praise these guys for making such a low-budget entrepreneurial image and for having the courage to wrap it into many concepts. It won't be a picnic for people who hate to think about movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the pattern of modern horror movies, predictability, lack of respect for the audience, it can only be your ticket.
