A very literate, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held a virtual prisoner in Hungary in 1956 by attacking the Russian Communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British Baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to make his piece for his country. Another New York theater star, Anne Jackson & E G Marshall, is playing an American couple traveling with her two young sons, including Ronny Howard in his canvas debut. Jackson's character is extremely pregnant and not eager to give birth in an early communist country; In the third act of this film, which introduces the naturalistic styles we have known today from Redgrave, Fonda and Streep, he makes a passionate plea. The leader of the Soviet wolf package is Yul Brynner, magnificent as commander, and in his hottest time when he played against Kerr in "The King and I". He is mediocre and ugly and terribly contrary to his attraction to the beautiful, patrician, and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great films of the transition to the second part of the Golden American era. Don't miss it.
