Spike Feresten is a comic genius. 'Talkshow' shows that this is an unusual spell that has proved successful. His sympathy is tangible. He seems to find a unique angle of wit, not a predictable path to comedy ... thank God. His comedy recalls the award-winning Arrested Development (via the fingers that 'Talkshow' has a longer life). The themes he highlights are those things that everyone else sees unnoticed, but when they make a joke around them, you wonder how you first walked around him. I especially liked the sketch ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in no time. Set up Tivo's people ... this is a show that's not to be missed.
