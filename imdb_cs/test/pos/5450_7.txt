This is a clever and fun movie about backroom fighting that went on to select Johnny Carson's successor at the Tonight Show. However, the film is the ultimate thesis that David Letterman's superior comedy talents were disregarded because of his controversial nature, and the show's diminished enthronement of lower Jay Leno in the lead comedy program on television is simply false, as anyone who watched both Leno and Letterman stand alone . The hard and simple truth is just as one of the NBC managers said in the movie "Jay Leno is the funniest man in America." And David Letterman is not. Once you realize it, then most of the machinations in the movie become irrelevant. Eventually, the whole movie is more than the acidic grapes from Letterman fans, who simply can't accept that a better comic has been chosen by people whose business is to know these things. The ultimate evidence is that despite Letterman's early leadership, perhaps because of the humbug that emerged from the Battle of the Tonight Show Succession, Leno's show consistently proved to be more popular, so, in my mind at least, refute Letterman's claim to be unfair \ t rightful legacy.
