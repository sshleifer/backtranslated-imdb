I really fell in love with the characters. They were very on the ground, but each had a hidden dark side. Some secret. David Graysmark himself was a mystery. Secret fears and just the secrets in general they had. His whole party was there, that the other characters didn't know anything, and the audience either thought or assumed. There was always the part of this man who would hide, but he would share it too. He was a strong male leader and I admire this type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could only do any type of work! It is an amazing talent and a good person. His fans love him, respect him and constantly support him. Since then, he has gone on to many other projects, and has extended his acting ability more and more well. Kudos tells him and all the other actors of this show for doing such a great job! I wish them all well. I wish the series continued! It's such a pity, no!
