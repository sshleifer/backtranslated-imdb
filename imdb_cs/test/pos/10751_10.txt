I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first I didn't recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary to China who came home to find a woman. There were many twists in Mr. Cobb's attempt to clean the town hall. His methods of making a punishment suitable for a crime would probably be illegal, but it is not a reality-based film. That would be a perfect movie for kids, except she is on a woman close to nudity (pasties on Grace Bradley only)! Old phones are charming. The only flaw is the problem that is typical of the day - white people represent Chinese men. This is counterbalanced by the positive way in which the Chinese are portrayed. They are wise, good and friendly guys. Trivia - Bekins truck appears in the movie when the police run out of Black Marias.
