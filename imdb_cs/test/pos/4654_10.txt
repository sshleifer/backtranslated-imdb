Twenty years after I watched it, I still feel like quoting things from this movie like "Look Between Two Huge Melons" or I'll start singing "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now make a sense of "Meat Machine" because there are still a lot of such stereotypes they have used for this movie. Those are the signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this film is a test of time that I can't say for many 80s. Still, this movie is still on the list of many popular movie people as a child growing up in the 80s. If you like games and have dreams of becoming a "Game Master" or find yourself dorking out through these 80's movies relive your childhood, you have to look at it. It's also sometimes sarcastic and funny. But one thing is definitely about this movie, if someone ever invites you to "Great All-Nighter", it doesn't mean you're going to some Midnight Madness! You'll see. Everyone will die playing! hehehehheh.
