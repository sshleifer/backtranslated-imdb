One of the benefits of my work is that when things are slow, I can watch a movie in our ground floor theater (I work in a small 2-screen theater) in the locker and still watch the concession stand. I saw Italian Job about 20 times and I still don't like it. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, although acting is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron appeals to the boys, but Seth Green is amazing in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a very good job of playing a dirtbag, though many people disagree. I also enjoyed Mos Def as an explosives expert who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever I can!
