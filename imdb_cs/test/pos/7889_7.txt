WARNING: Read this record after playing the movie! Just like "Easy Rider", which was released a year ago, "Joe" is trying to illustrate what happens when counter-culture and mainstream (though right-wing) America meet: a violent ending follows. Although this film is largely a slow movement of traditional "old-fashioned" American morals compared to the "do-what-feels-good" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also a commentary on the higher classes vs. class and their inability to meet in the middle as shown when the Comptons met Currany. Boyle's Joe presents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 1950s where 's kill for a mom (or jap or hippie for that issue) is fine as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and Mary Jo's wife are clearly archetypes for Archie Bunker and wife Dingbat, Edith. This film - which will forever be known for its violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all) end up being uneven. Joe blasty (verbally) hippie generation then (literally) lays with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate Compton's daughter - when clearly should be discouraged by the idea, but renounces separatist thought for sex. When he is betrayed through thievery (read: the trust of the older generation to the newer generation), he rips through the inexorable string of murder. Maybe it's because of Tarantinos Hollywood that the observer expects blood-streaming death in the final scene, but bloodless shooting longs for any impact or realism. 'Joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting depiction of class and cultural alienation and animal foundations of the extremes of the generation gap.
