I really like this series. His witty and unique style off the wall, sometimes a controversial comedy, is a fresh look at the genre. while it is a sitcom, it stands out for what could be unpleasant subjects. every aspect has a comedy turn, and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the program are rather special father's comments, dave. its rants interrupt the program and allow a really good flow. it is not perfect because sometimes comedy may not laugh loudly, and actors sometimes seem to be waiting for the viewer's response, but otherwise this program is good. I am very sad that it was canceled. Make another series and finish it correctly
