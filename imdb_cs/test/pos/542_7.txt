Anywhere But it's nothing new, but the outstanding performances of both major actresses are worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are mother and daughter who have moved from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, looking for a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would rather stay in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and felt she was forced to go to California with her mother. While it is true that the film as a whole is disappointing predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman report performances that are so good that they almost make the material new. Anywhere But there are no new reasons here, but it is of rare quality that it is able to take over the overused topic and again it is quite interesting. Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years, seen on the face of Natalie Portman when her mother drops her on the side of the road and she watches as the car fades into the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subject of Natalie's mother, who is pushing her to become an actress, and a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natal's close cousins ​​from home. His death is a tragic cliché that is almost always seen in films like this, but the rest of the film is a series of such weaknesses. It's not great, but anywhere But it's definitely worth a look.
