The hospital is a film that was created before its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-winning film, "Network," deals with overworked personnel, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption in a major Manhattan conglomerate hospital. Outstanding as Chief Medical Officer, George C. Scott is led to alcoholism and death because he is trying to recover from divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and the worst of all is a medical facility where corruption and incompetence are found to take precedence over caring and treating the sick and the injured. Mr. Scott makes his own movie and viewers will be shocked at what they're watching in this medical facility. You can feel the "pain" (pun) of what this hospital has done to him. The live images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatic that you can find yourself laughing and deeply disturbing the scene. If this movie stayed in the movie only in the movie as it starts, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a partial plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient murdered the people in the hospital. This is where the image's credibility becomes tense. Romantic dialogue scenes do not add anything to the picture, and the mental patient who acts as a physician has found it absolutely incredible. A simple security challenge and control of records should have prevented the senile patient from killing. It takes almost the entire movie before security people are brought to the movie to get the patient out of the hospital. I couldn't see the ONE PERSON doing so much damage, even as bad as this hospital. In addition, the character of George C Scott is "redesigned" (another pun) because the script has too many things to do at once. For example, within 20 minutes you could have up to 20 different doctors who will be charged and denied what they should have done or not. It's the same story with nurses and aids. Someone is badly loaded, someone got bad treatment and died, the doctor was treating the wrong patient before another doctor did the same, blaming a third nurse who was not on the alert because the second nurse who was to receive the patient was on a coffee break. There are also plenty of subtle, dark humors with the same messages of incompetence and corruption that the viewer is given. This repetition of medical incapacity is unforgettable. But the murder subplot is a distraction more than helping this film. When this film focuses on the incompetence of staff and Scott's reaction to the subject, you are stuck on the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter forced the film to a mysterious "Who did it?" a scenario that seriously damages film quality. When a dwarf patient reveals how he killed himself, I was thinking about the following: Why do manufacturers need to "find a killer" insane patient sub-fence? I think Scott's only character who has a relationship with a senile patient's daughter was to give him anyone to talk to. The hospital should keep its frightening health care accusation by removing the scenes of love and mad patients. She should have focused more often on incompetent B.S inside his walls. At a time when this film could have been phenomenal, the stories of the sub-storyline make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece that it might be.
