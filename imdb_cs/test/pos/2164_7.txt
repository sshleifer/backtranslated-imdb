Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has some nice animation except for special looking bugs and nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, it was such a nice and fun touch. In fact, the whole caricature is nice to watch, but in everything it's not what I call exceptional as Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they were used before I felt, and there wasn't much that I would consider hilarious. And Daffy joins forces with Elmer? It seemed to be something that was the target of the hunter. Although I admit it was nice to have Daffy there. Voice playing was too average, but I missed Mel Blanc somehow. <br /> <br /> All in all, an extraordinary but very nice cartoon. Bethany Cox
