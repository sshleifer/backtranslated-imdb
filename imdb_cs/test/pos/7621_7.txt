I'm not sure if these people saw the movie - some might not have followed the "complicated plot". He is a billionaire who owns an oil company that also becomes a big game hunting - wow - that is far away. Any - its new "drilling machine" happens to break through the glacier and, on the other hand, the world is separate from our time when dinosaurs and cavemen roam. Nothing was wrong, but it wasn't ridiculous. The rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they will find (which was a billionaire, Boone, he claimed to be there) and hunt him. Look - it's an old movie made for television - of course special effects look cheesy - they didn't have CG - they did the best they could, and they did it for MFTVM. This movie should be redesigned to a big screen - I'd like it and I'd be first in line. When we see that a modern day special Dinosaur is chasing those guys, it will be great!
