No, I haven't seen the original series and I don't understand the two if I had. This series is shot in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in another story every week. Some are out there, but mostly it's the quality of storytelling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with Irresistible Brent Spiner as Deprogrammer in a world where people became slaves to a Lizard reptile. It's funny how lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens, like V, but still has three days to program a man who is totally washed out by the brain that serves alien species on Earth. Stories are usually a little outside, but very fun to watch.
