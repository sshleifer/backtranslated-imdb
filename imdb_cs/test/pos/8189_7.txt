Chen Kaige lost his sense of pace. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch a movie without following their ears because it is painful to do it: slow, unnaturally heavy and too thoughtful. On the other hand, the West is suffering from poor quality of subtitle translations that can lose all subtlety and double meanings that make the careful study of the film so fun.
