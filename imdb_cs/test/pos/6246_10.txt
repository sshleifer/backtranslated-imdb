"Tourist Trap" is a really scary low-budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are quite unpleasant moments of total fear and fear. Some scenes are totally bizarre, for example, there is one scene where Chuck Connors sits for dinner with a mannequin who comes to life and begins to talk to him before his head falls. There is very little gore, but violence is quite strong for PG-rated horror film. Dummies look very ominous, and Peak is scary.David Schmoeller has returned to make several other genre films, including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". Be scared to give it a little gem look. Rated PG for short nudity, violence and profanity.
