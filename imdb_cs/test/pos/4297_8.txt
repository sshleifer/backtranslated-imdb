I wish there were more movies about middle-aged people. Intellectual journey and twists and moral highways of life bring interesting observation. There seems to be a different standard of judgment for women who have extramarital affairs than men. The damaging and humiliating behavior of Amy Watson against her husband seems to be without comment. Reverse roles, and one might expect a rush of conviction to reach him. If she found out that her husband was boring and incriminating, she could tell him, she left and waited for the undoubtedly great financial settlement after the divorce. The scenes of the country and London are beautifully authentic and rich, while the autumn weather perfectly complements the melancholic background. The end is perfect, so it's in line with real adult life.
