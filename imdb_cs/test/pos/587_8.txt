I enjoyed the MILPET MOVIE very much. It was the first of Muppet's films and is by far the best because it is so creative and fresh. With later films, thoughts didn't seem so original. But here, we see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (incredibly heavy scenes), an excellent set cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute the Muppets performed, and I would consider the film much more, except for one serious problem. In this and most subsequent Muppet films, some of the powers that are felt there were needed to include a lot of non-Muppets - particularly, many, many portraits by stars. Some worked fine (eg Charles Durning), but many of them seemed irrelevant and slowed the image to silence. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the little scene he was in was not needed, or most of them. Despite this great complaint, this is a great movie for the whole family - from kids to the most demanding adults.
