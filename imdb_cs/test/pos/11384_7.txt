The three names that mean the most of this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three perform the strongest performances, but the whole cast has a great job. However, the film about porn industry is not getting out of hand with its own sexual premise. On the other hand, there were many scenes that involved drug use, and although they are important for understanding the lifestyle of the characters, I think there has been some overpopulation in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson did not make much of a direct but maybe he was chosen for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story". One thing that has been brilliantly portrayed is the family as the atmosphere between characters when they work, live and play together. Though not a typical family, they seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack will really help you feel the time when the disco was angry. There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well. The story is about a talented young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who gets invited to the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an almost adult movie star. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is a director who takes his films very seriously because he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that it is a real art. However, Dirk becomes too addicted to drugs and soon sets out on a dangerous road where he stands to lose everything. Although greater emphasis is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for other characters and their exams in life. You will find yourself wishing that their situation will improve. All-in-all well done film.
