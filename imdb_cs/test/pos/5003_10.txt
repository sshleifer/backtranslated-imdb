This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That ordinary chair (couch for a woman) host, this mandatory band plays monotonous melodies, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the Nebuchadnezzer days .... probably Johnny Carson's pattern, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly , this show probably doesn't have any of these things. I fell in love with this show in the first 10 minutes and I will stick to it. Although it is too early to say, this show seems to be without any intellectual prejudices that most discussion programs will try to project so much, and I hope this is what would make this show different from all the others. I hope this exhibition will take a long time! We come back in months, I still love this show and I love his suicidal humor. watch his show on Saturday midnight, so the jokes are funny only to stoned guys, but they don't include the usual Conan O'Brien monkeys, for example (I know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by O '). and I really don't like the repeatability). I watched him again tonight with Tom Arnold. Ferensen's Spoof of Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in the earlier episode) are merry. The paparazzi idiot is entertaining, especially when the guard warns them of taking pictures of people, and (if I'm not mistaken) they start to photograph and shout "Gary Coleman". Added April 16, 2007 I came back again and I am confused by the neighbor and her dog. I can't decide if it's a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was fun like hell. I don't expect Spike Feresten to read this site, but maybe it does. He's crazier than a bunch of monkeys, so I'd like to write him here: I'd like to make a full 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of a later TV commercial. I'd like Crazy Gideon to take part in a Spike talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), parody the SNL and answer the audience's questions about his potential mayor in Los Angeles, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of that but there are websites that describe why he would be the ideal candidate for LA's mayor. God willing! July 14, 2007: Someone here wrote that people who praised Spike's talk show must be bribed by Spike. I admit Spike really bribed me, but I also have to admit Rockefeller named me in his will and I had sex with Cindy Crowford last night.
