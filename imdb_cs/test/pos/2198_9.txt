"Sweeney Todd" is, in my opinion, one of the few "perfect" musicals. Just like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story" she has amazing, intelligent scores. It offers two leading positions and several support roles for interesting roles. He has a timeless theme, revenge. He has a lot of humor and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a large scale. "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a simply confused man during an industrial period in England. It shows man inhumanity to man, as in Sweeney's own words: "There are two kinds of men. The one who stays in place and the one who has a foot in the other's face. In an effort to remedy what happened to him, Mr. Todd was trying to get revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat pie shop at Mr. Todd's barberhop, they decided to have "those upstairs serving those who are down". I was lucky to see the original Broadway versions eight times (six with Caria and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw a revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler and some other versions of the concerts. While the technical aspects of this production are missing, at least, I believe this film version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles and have a great time playing each other. Very Good Support Work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, how young lovers have absolutely no chemistry, and are basically unobservable. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
