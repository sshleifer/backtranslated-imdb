When I was young, I was a big fan of Naked Gun movies, but I recently watched Police Sqaud! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is amazing, Alan North is cool and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But anyway, it's a goofy show. One of my favorite parts of this show when they make a freeze frame during final credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) walks during the scene and tries to fit into the freezer frame. Classic! The only problem for me is that the gag cigarette gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks, "Cigarette?" And the person replies, "Yes, I know.") too many times. <br /> <br /> Good gaming, good gags, great show! <br/> 7/10
