This is the best time of comedy. It's so underestimated! Smart funny humor, big casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel of the show, he's so incredibly witty and unpredictable, just a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! I don't see what a hype is about anyone who loves Raymond, that SO is overrated with lame jokes, mostly by forced humor and just no funny show, I can't remember laughing in more than one episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughter, which is normally caused by Arthur Spooner, I think his time comedy gets the hype he deserves, not lame Raymond & CO.
