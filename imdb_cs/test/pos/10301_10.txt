This film is based primarily on the emotions and interaction of people. Only three locations are used (school, shop and coach house). But it is mainly in the coach. The film doesn't need special effects or amazing looks to be amazing in itself. Four friends who have teamed up during their basketball days will meet. One is rich, important and has no real love beyond money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition turns him into sour. One wants to be a school supervisor and take care of his family. One is an alcoholic passenger. First of all I like actors in this movie. Everyone told me. Here they worked. One of the most important moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, explodes on a coach. Shouting and bragging about how the coach cheated on the winning game. His blow to the coach whistle and screams back his phrases - "Forgive me Father because I have sinned!" It's amazing to watch with the energy that just cools you. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend anyone who understands human emotions and does not need shiny effects that interest them.
