A lone boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of shady chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing from a mansion where he works with Mr. Grimm (James Mason) - a real thief - and goes on. run. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the estate owners (Samantha Gates, slim, blue-eyed blonde, with long, wavy hair that I'm sure was the main reason I repeatedly watched it as a boy). He and his dog jump into the river and the witch turns them into cartoon characters! While underwater, he combines and rescues a body of water to breathe children known as water kids from a shark. Very interesting and always fascinating fable, set in 1850, which should appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of 85 minutes of HBO VHS printing) is just average, but better than the latest daytime animation - even computer animation! My only real gripe is a plot of a hole caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse "High Cockalorum", the film cuts off the scene with an octopus swim, followed by Tom and Jacque meeting with Terence. This leads to a scene in which a shark killer (voiced by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom: "Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly mug again" - but this is the first time in HBO that Tom meets a shark! Most reference books show a run time of 92 or 93 minutes, and this was previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is very likely that HBO printing is edited and / or time-compressed. Adding insult to injury, MGM released fullscreen, 76 minutes of DVD printing in 2002! Hopefully a renewed version will appear in the near future. The film is copyrighted by Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is a water child expressed by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in crime, also expresses an electric eel. A.K.A. Slip Slide Adventures.
