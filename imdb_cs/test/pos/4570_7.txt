He caught it recently after noticing the name of James Earl Jones on the title. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's pretty old - made during the early / mid-1970s, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs fast 90min or so and features good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The storyline is general in general, but it tells the story of one black woman on welfare that has 6 children and tries to solve all the problems that persist. This is an interesting look ..... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or overrated - it's almost like looking at a piece of the past. All 70 styles are abundant. However, the end is a kind of coca, thoughâ€¦ it would probably be better without theatria.
