I look at tons of movies and I didn't know it would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the conspiracy (although I found out that Nirvana was overrated). It sounded like it was a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen puts small touches like books (including Kubrick's book), movie posters, etc. I like seeing a director take his time and put his heart in the movie. And you can really feel it. There are a lot of scenes and moments I love, I try to think about some of the other movies that are like this, and I say the only thing I think is Cameron Crowe's movies. It takes little time and makes them stand out and special. The soundtrack is amazing, and every song perfectly matches the scenes and feel of the film. This film is amazingly shot and the cut is excellent. I could really go on and on about the movie. I really can't recommend it. If you want a fun story with big melodies from the director who put his heart in his work, then check it out.
