Krajobraz after bitwie as many Wajdy movies may be incomprehensible to the "rest of the world". A story based on several stories by Tadeusz Borowski, who was imprisoned during the Second World War from Auschwitz, Dachau and Dautmergen. In his books, Borowski describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the perspective of the vorarbeiter Tadek - porte parole author, who was also privileged among prisoners. Borowski was merciless for mankind and merciless for himself. He describes human history as an infinite chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist who produced a stream of anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. After several years, he committed suicide. He changes his mind in Wajda. Vorarbeiter Tadek - a character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only a supporting role. The story focuses on the poet, destroyed, burned out by war and prison, and his one-day love affair with Nina, a Jewish girl who escaped from Communist Poland, even though she actually hates Jewish life and mentality. As a background we can observe the sad grotesque life of the so-called "Dipis" (displaced persons), which the Americans settled in the SS barracks after liberation. Marches, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for overdose of food and / or prostitutes of German girls. <br /> <br />
