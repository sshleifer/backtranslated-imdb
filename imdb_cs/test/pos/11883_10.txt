Critters 4 is one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The word classic has never been so aptly used to describe this stunning epic. I agree that the original Critters is the best of the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which Critters 4 is set must actually be seen. I highly recommend anyone interested in one of the major 20th century film sights.
