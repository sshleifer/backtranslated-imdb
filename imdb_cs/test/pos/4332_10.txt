This movie is a real action at its best, it's no better than this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non-stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all this. My favorite is one bad guy who breaks into this old couple at home and he steals TV or something and he goes to them and shouts, "I'll come here anytime I like !!!" and just before it jumps out of the window, shouts "Anytime !!!" I think this is just a classic thing, so you have a choice to watch that crappy Will Smith is trying to go for an action movie, or you can see one of Charles Bronson's Masters !!!!
