In this special film, the end-of-day themes and Satan versus Jesus are conceived in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is frustrated in his attempt to get another soul into hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Yehoshaphat prove to be a society - and the book of life is a little small to open. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unforgettable is the oblique image, sharp shots and light effects that are effective but sometimes irritating. And Donovan is, of course, great as a disillusioned Jesus who tries to cope with what the world and his people have become! So you see it if you have the opportunity!
