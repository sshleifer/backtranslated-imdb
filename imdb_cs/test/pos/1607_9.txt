I can't explain why I consider it so tempting and "The Leopard" not; it may be because we are focusing on everything that was great with this film, the intimate moments that Visconti can render so beautifully. Like the movie, it has a majestic slow pace, but this time it's not too long. It's the kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes like that. I think it must be part of the way the film deals with flashbacks that work like their own mini-story. Like "Leopard," he has a sympathetic leadership that brings the same kind of worn pathos - even though Bogard's performance is more willing to open himself to be unlikable, especially in the view: he has a really stupid smile that he doesn't like. In quiet moments it is often quite beautiful. It is the wealth of Visconti's films, the grandeur of ball scenes that seem tiring to me because they exchange an individual overview with mass accuracy. But here, that's part of the point - Gustav surrounded by visual food. The way the subject of Gustav's affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, a girl, a girl, then this beautiful, female boy. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets and it doesn't feel heavy hands. (It's not as long as the camera doesn't see Tadzio completely, pulls back, and we see his long, slender legs realizing he's not a boy, but a teen - we initially forced Gustav's appeal into uncomfortable ways; ) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we get the man's feeling, we know him. It is quite a quiet performance, and when it opens its mouth, it is spewing poison; No wonder he wants the angelic, open boy to be projected. There's a difference with Tadzi (we never know him, just as we never know how many of them have Fellini's slapstick, but it's because his life is different, his own movie), but it's not as flirtatious as it seems (he's here one) scene, however, where it revolves around a rod that is too much). Tadzio doesn't necessarily lead him - he looks at him; Visconti just zooms in, it's all. The film does not say that Gustav is gay - Tadzio is not really a man, it is a pre-printed version of a boy (soft, pale, wise, with gold locks) that everyone seems to love (including one gorgeous , A little older boy he is struggling with). The closest they go to show what can be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene that unlocks his suppressed vanity. It's not entirely successful - the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people who wear bags in a long shot could be cut out. Some parts are heavy, as Gustav's boat is pulling, and fools are passing by around him - the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav throws a fit, he wants a new rower, something so inexplicable about what he does for it.) But there are some scenes - touching for the first time, creating a remarkable, quiet intensity. Tadzio repeats the piano song over and over, notes that tremble in the air can be the best example of the anxiety the film has. There is one discussion that includes a debate that I am particularly interested in: Can the art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or must it follow them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who values ​​both Visconti and Mann to be a prime example of someone who goes beyond mere sensory perceptions). 9/10
