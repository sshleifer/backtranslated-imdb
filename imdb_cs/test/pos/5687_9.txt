This film tries to do something very specific, but it also tries to do certain things. In short, it certainly has a predetermined trajectory - dealing with the idea of ​​facing death (with very little possibilities and all the bad), more serious and real than something casual or fun. In search of this realism she avoided certain conventions, such as obvious character arcs and hooks. It's not about characters as much as about human condition. It doesn't matter what the actors would do ... what would you do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open Water can be a starting point for this movie, but it goes much further. Unlike the film, it does not cheat the viewer at the end when you find that there are no sharks they would ever talk about. It has a real monster, not just a monster idea, not just an animated stand. It also has good production values ​​with which these creative creators had to work. And again, unlike the other film, which has some exciting and brilliantly rendered action at its peak. And let's not forget, say 'dazzling', the presence of the screen of his youngest star. It may turn out to be quite a discovery.
