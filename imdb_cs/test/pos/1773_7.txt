This is one of several period marine yarns of its time, which has added a difference (though not in itself unique) female buccaneer in its midst. Initially, both players - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem wrong, but they will eventually grow into their roles, no doubt talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Velvety-voiced Marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship's mandatory philosophical fresh doctor, and Gomez is appropriately larger-than-life as Blackbeard The Pirate. The cast is completed by Debra Paget as wife of Jourdan's, who emanates the jealous rage of tomboyish titular character in which Jourdan instills the first sting of love (which, however, does not save him from occasional flogging or sword-wounded); by the way, the film was the second exotic team of Jourdan and Paget in one year, after Delmer Daves BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct consequence of this unexpected softening of Anna's character is that she dropped Blackbeard and her unlikely sacrifices with the crew to save the lives of Jourdan, Paget, and Marshall. While the film is an extraordinarily exceptional example of its kind, Jacques Tourneur's vigorous direction and Franz Waxman's grandiose score ensure an above-average effort that moves at a fast pace; By the way, Tourneur has already done the service in the genre with the superior car Burt Lancaster, FLAME and ARROW (1950). As with Technicolor's annual productions, cinematography lends luxury to the film, which is refreshing. By the way, for this movie (81 or 87 minutes), different run times are listed, and for the record the version I watched was shorter.
