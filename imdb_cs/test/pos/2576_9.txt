I was surprised how it turned out that Black Snake Moan was great. Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson id id I'm going to try this. That means everything was fine and it was very accurate. This film shows how big director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can take whatever seems to be ludacrasem I like it as it is just a good time like his movie that just doing there in a good way. I am also glad that it does not show great steroids in the south and how it has been shown in things as the most repulsive place to be, but not this movie does it very accurate and because it very reconisable. Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job about everything that's great about it and while its not every type of film its definitely worth watching from anyone who can enjoy a good time. Three Cheers Pro Black Snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
