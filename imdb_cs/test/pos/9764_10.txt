This movie is a sleeper - I've seen every miniseries that have ever been on TV several times, and this is the best. Wonderfully cast, great acting and characters are well developed. Helen Morse fits perfectly into the part of Jean Paget - sharp, under control, sharp and a bit aggressive. She bounces well off Joe Harmon, a cowboy / silent / "That'll be fine" kind of guy. I am sorry that the film did not stick to the book because there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know, it is taken from a true story of English women marching through Malaysia for 3 years Japanese who did not really know what to do with them. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute talked to one of them and that's her story. This film deserves to be in the collection of anyone who loves WWII stories.
