Attention, My Lovely recently arrived on TV on BBC2 during the first hours, so I set up a video to record and I was glad I did. The man finds a dead woman, so he escapes, blames for her murder and gets a job as a handyman in the widow's house, but she doesn't know what he's taking. It turns out that this person is a psychopath and a possible killer. She starts to torment her and locks her in the basement. Then he cuts off the phone line so he can't get help from outside. A young boy who regularly buys his notes is not quite right when he is going to make purchases. Finally, the man leaves, behaves as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> I see why it was given that my Lovely got the X certificate when he was released in cinemas. Some scenes are somewhat ugly for this time. I also thought the man would do something with a young boy too. The cast represents the outstanding performance of Robert Ryan as a psychopath, Ida Lupino as a widow and joins Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as a boy. This is certainly the most distinctive performance of Robert Ryan I have seen. He must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
