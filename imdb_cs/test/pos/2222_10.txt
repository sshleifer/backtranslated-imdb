One of the most fun movies I've ever seen in the theater in the early 70s, and unfortunately it's been on television several times ever since. This movie should be posted on video. It's the Sellers at his weakest, weakest best as a tortuous hospital administrator. Great cast, great movie. If someone has a good copy of VHS, I'd like to buy it.
