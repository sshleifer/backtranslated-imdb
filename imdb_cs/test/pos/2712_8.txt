Personally, I didn't know Karen Carpenter, nor Richard, so I have to go as the film portrays her. I think a better person to ask about his accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned about Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness, and was a very special person to me. I know I was born in 1965, so I didn't know her like some of you older fans, but I grew up listening to her music and I love her music. I remember a song about "radio" (every sha la la la everyone who is so cool, etc.) And I remember, "we just started! In fact, I remembered many, many of her songs and some people ( quite a few) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her !!! (I won't say it), I was also anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987). Â£ 120 in 1987. I've developed some pretty serious health problems that helped me identify myself with an actress depicting Karen in the movie. Mother (Agnes) was very much like my mother in many I could also feel the pain Karen had to experience because the mother was often insensitive, critical, and disapproving because Agnes was (if true) a more personal note that she could not just hear her music, but she sees what she is going through to finally portray a man's whole life in 2-3 hours Odin and perfectly depict every detail so I have to say that there is probably no biography that is so accurate. I'll give this story 8! I wish I knew Karen personally! I'd like to meet her! I'd love if I shook her hand, hugged her or talked to her. I can feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and she is left out.
