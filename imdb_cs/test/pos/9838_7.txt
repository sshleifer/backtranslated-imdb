This is not a 'real' James Cagney vehicle because its screen time is unusually slim. Frankie Darro plays a tough kid, Jimmy Smith, a street criminal gang leader who is sent to school with some of his friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader who has the position of Deputy Commissioner. When he finds out that there has been a cruel treatment in the Reform School, he is forced to make some major changes with the help of the Reformer (Madge Evans). MAYOR HELL is fast and still fun after all these years. The cast is well rounded featuring: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, 'Farina' Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
