At a time when Hollywood thinks it's better, faster, and bloodier, Manna From Heaven is a comic and touching look at something we've all thought about: What would I do if a lot of money fell from the sky. Interestingly, it took many years for the characters to realize that money did not make a single difference in their lives. They all become what they should be. Unfortunately, in most cases what happened was unfortunate, despite their good luck all those years ago. While Manna Offers Good Hollywood Story Good vs. Good Evil, or in the case of Generosity vs. Greed, what makes this film apart is that Good wins by converting Evil, not by crushing it. I think the important message of this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it with one person at a time.
