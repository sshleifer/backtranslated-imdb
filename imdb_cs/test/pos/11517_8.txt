New York Lights was the first feature film. Of course there was The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927, as the first feature film to feature a synchronized dialogue. However, this film, released in July 1928, is virtually unforgettable for its place in film history. It started short, but it was more than deployed - up to 58 minutes - which happened to be the first feature film. The running track opened and Warner Bros was surprised to make over a million dollars. That was good money in 1928. <br /> <br /> The storyline is quite simple. Two country barbers naively buy into a barber shop on Broadway, which is the front as a gangster "The Hawk." When they learn the truth, they can't afford to get out because the younger barber Eddie has all her mother's money in place. Kitty is a girlfriend of a younger barber, and Wheeler Oakman has an eye for turning in her older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) for a newer model - Kitty Girl Girl (Helene Costello). The cop is killed while trying to stop Hawk's men from unloading the shipment of smuggled alcohol, and Hawk sees it as an opportunity to build Eddie and get Kitty to himself. fun for enthusiasts of these pioneering works. Sure, the plot is elementary and the dialogue turns on, but there is something you don't see in the early interviews - a musical score in the background. Vitaphone was originally used for this purpose and is still used for musical accompaniment and dialogue. And there are singing and dancing numbers! Hawk nightclubs are used as an opportunity to showcase what movies could never do - music numbers. There is even a wild-eyed emcee with some heavy makeup left from the silent era that is hoot to watch. Vitaphone could not go outside at this point due to static camera cabs, so the scene in the park between two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated - and cheaply. The greenery looks like something from Ed Wood's movie or maybe the high school production "Our City". Gladys Brockwell, as a friend of Hawk's courage, gives her lines a punch. He is a real soldier who considers what lines he must bring. Hawk - "So you think you can have some chicken you want, and throw me back aboard!" Huh? mixed metaphors of someone? And then there are her last lines "I lived and loved and I lost!" Did anyone get paid for writing this dialogue? Brockwell made a good success of her talkie career after recording some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister in "Seventh Heaven"), when a fatal car accident shortened her career short. Then there is Eugene Palette - the older of the two barbers in our story. His frog voice, natural line delivery, and plush look gave him a long career as a character actor who usually appeared as a put-on family man / businessman with a grumpy exterior and a heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast who still has a remarkable career in movies just three years after the release of this film. Finally, the question is "where is the microphone hidden?" "Microphones were still stationary at this point, and it's fun to find out where they were hidden. But there is one famous scene where everyone can think of it. Hawk is in his office talking to his two followers - who seem to be so slow as he talks about "using Eddie for a ride." If you look at this scene, you swear the phone on the table is a sign in this movie. It's all in the front and in the middle of the conversation. There is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of new sound technology. at the Vitaphone camera stand, and you have dialog writers who are trying to write a conversation as compact as they did the cover cards or filling the movies with endless shakes Check it in. It's not boring, moving fast, and it's a lot of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I don't expect this to ever be on Blu-Ray, but I hope the Warner Brothers people will soon add it to the Warner Archive, so everyone will see it.
