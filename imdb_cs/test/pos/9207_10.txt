I think Josh Duhamel is so great! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but I think it's nice and sexy Josh Duhamel who makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun to see !! In the days of "Magnum" I loved Tom Selleck, I thought he was the sexiest man on earth! Hunk on a TV show is a must for women to watch something, especially just for the sake of harmless fun !! I would do anything to win a date with Tad Hamilton! Josh Duhamel is incredible and I always have a super crush on him! Josh is definitely HUNK !! and I'll watch "Las Vegas" all the time, Josh Duhamel is a big reason why too!
