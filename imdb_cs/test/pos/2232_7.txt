I did this at the Turner Classic just because it was pre-code and it sounded interesting. When I got to the observation, I noticed that "criticism" gave him one and a half stars in a four-star scale. I started to watch with anxiety - even old movies can be bad movies - but I quickly joined the story and performance of Mary Astor as a business brain behind the rise of a simple salesman to success. It's not really a great movie - too predictable - but definitely better than advertised. And I'd like to see more Ricardo Cortez as a man who values ​​Mary, but doesn't give up his rich wife. I would recommend that it look just to appreciate Astor and how long we have come, baby.
