"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is Almod√≥var's best film. It shows his unique personality at his best and least-censored, before he began to go more mainstream. Almodovar is just about one modern director who can access the amazing Preston Sturges brand. It is useless to try to explain what the film is about, the real point is the willingness and skill of Almodovar to bring his situations to the outer limits of common sense and sometimes of credibility and taste.
