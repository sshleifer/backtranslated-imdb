And there were enough. I do not like this caricature as much as many others, partly because it was made in its period. I very much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs that are fifteen years ago. Many people like it, especially people who always find funny, cartoon or not violence. The basic plot is pretty well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes out hunting, Daffy leads him to mistakes and Daffy is instead shot. Also embedded are quite clever and very fun jokes (some do not increase the episode), nasty shooting and animation, which is slightly average. The storyline is mainly focused on jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. This way of conspiracy in Looney Tunes isn't so unusual (of course, if you're pretty much Looney Tunes boffin - or eager - like me, then you already know it). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I said about it, enjoy "Rabing Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
