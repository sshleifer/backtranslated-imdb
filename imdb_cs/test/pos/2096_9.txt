When the Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping clan Samanosuke, the faithful Kogent holder (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his eight-year-old son, Tadafumi and his daughter Kozasa. They are protected by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god Hanabusa of the clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit trapped in a giant figure carved into the side of the local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in trial and sentenced to death. Shinobu priestess, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with divine displeasure, only to be cut to death for her efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel, narrow man, orders Majin's statue to be destroyed to crush the last remains of hope among the remaining loyalists of Hanabus. God Majin, who has been extremely quiet yet, has other ideas ... Daimajin is a fascinating, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. It is a film about values: values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. It is a hierarchy and government and the consequences of non-compliance that this rule requires. These are the things we don't talk much about in our demotic times, except that we are scrawling toads like William Bennet, but they are important and Daimajin shows us why. Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so famous. The above values ​​are of tangible importance to those involved in this film, as well as to many Japanese filmmakers. There is no lip service, no condescension, no irony. Instead, there is an authentic effort to conjure up a world in which these values ​​can have life again and show what happens when they fall. Just compare Daimajin, or Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa movie with the incredible nihilistic Kill Bill bantil Tarantino to see what I mean. I would like to point out the majestic score of Master Akira Ifikuu, the talent and beauty of the actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and stunning views of Otome Tsukimiya. Her death scene is one of the most moving and most important I've ever seen.
