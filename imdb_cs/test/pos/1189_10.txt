Thank God for this movie. It is a talent document that, three decades later, seems even rare and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> Music is just extraordinary, full of talents in writing, performance, arrangement and production that is absolutely absolutely perfect. infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. Showcasing underrated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods raise my spirit every time I hear them. While the movie may be different from the version on stage, I prefer the soundtrack to the recorded album, which seems to me to be very nimble and underdeveloped. Here, these measures are filled in and expanded to dynamic pieces that could not be created in the scene. But music is not the only thing extraordinary about this movie. Juxtaposition of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminiscent of Altman's movies), which takes place with lush musical and dance numbers, really works. All the talent in this film - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, playing, costumes, art - is perfectly combined into one of the best music movies I've ever seen. I think it's amazing how much we know about characters in "Hair" based on a very small amount of information or conspiracy. They are not drawn as cartoons, but as realistic and very human people. We see little flashes from where they come, but the portrait is complemented by medallions that draw characters to the surface through perfect play, direction and cut. There is an undercurrent theme of misogyny Berger and Hud which colors their characters by revealing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. Berger's home life scene reveals important details about his psychology, and a brief look at Claude's home tells us about his background through a simple, realistic and real interaction between Claude and (probably) his father. I love fashion in this movie. This defiantly blends the ideas of the sixties with the VERY 70s (one has to overlook the extension of the hair extensions ...). It is a documentary about how the leaning of the late 1970s was, unlike the common wisdom, that the era was about bad taste. Claude's beige knit tie was a hot trend in 1979, and the hair and clothing of singers and dancers (especially those who were whites during the Central Park scene) blended decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of musical themes. These elements are combined with the extraordinary choreography of Twyly Tharpe, which enhances the art of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a film that rewards cynicism. If you expect it, then you will most likely be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it has opened my eyes and ears and spirit to a mysterious and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that goes beyond its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me.
