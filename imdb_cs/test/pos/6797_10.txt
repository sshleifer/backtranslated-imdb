Two of Hollywood's greatest Hollywood stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are perfectly matched to deliver one of the first-class family classics. A story of a determined 12-year-old girl whose adoration for her horse does not allow her to turn away from the goal of winning the British Nationals. Mickey Rooney is a newly lone drifter who wants to tie up until he can watch his own dreams. The beautiful side plot shows that the girl's mother had her own ambitions as a young girl. He repeatedly represses his father's decision in favor of their witty daughter, a mother who seems to know best. The scene where the exhausted Taylor rushes to go to school is priceless: Father protests, "Why did you let her go to school, she'll fall from exhaustion before noon!" - Don't worry, he'll be back in half an hour; it was Saturday! Brilliant Technicolor, luxury music scores, and those beautiful faces, all tell a bitter story. Here's a good reason for the old saying: Don't do it like that anymore!
