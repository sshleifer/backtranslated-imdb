I just stepped out of the pre-screening and wow was this merry movie. Maybe better than the first, but at least the same. If you do not like jackass, or really unnecessary amount of male nudity (more than in the first) then stay far, far. But if you kick the whole Jackass thing, then this movie won't disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. OK. So my rating wasn't long enough ... Everything else I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, really kicking that kick. So if you like masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (John Waters is involved, need to say more?), Then this movie will keep you in stitches for it all. I never stopped laughing and actually came out sweat-filled.
