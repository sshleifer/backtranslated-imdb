Owen loves her mom ... just to love her six feet less in this dark laughing comedy, and both stars and director Danny DeVito with admirable assistance Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role. "Throwing Mom off the train" is an amazing comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It's too shallow and the end feels less organic than it is. But it's the way that breaks down the intestines, with Crystal and DeVito, who work with great chemistry on the screen, working with their own comics, are the basis for being a writer (DeVito is passionate, but untamed; Crystal is blocked and bitter). Br /> <br /> Professor Crystal Donner believes his ex-wife has stolen his book (unfortunately called "Hot Fire") and cannot write more than the opening line of her next book, which is not easy. He teaches creative writing a class of beginners, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy's fiction, but doesn't know what the captain is talking about. and a upholsterer who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for a laugh-to-minute screen, a slave wearing an ascot who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: "100 girls who would like pork." <br /> <br /> Then there is Dewito Owen Lift, who is called Professor Donner's "stellar pupil", although the teacher does not read his classroom work. Owen is a somewhat unusual character playing in the film, a man-child in his late 30s who lives with his groundbreaking mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lardass" and other cute feelings. In any other movie we would be asked to apologize for Owen, but "Throw Momma From The Train" accumulates life atrocities on this sad laugh bag and expects to go together. This is one of the main reasons why this movie seems to be losing a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like this kind of humor, they even identify with it and take the rest of what we see here, Leprechaun, it's not such a big stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes, asking us to watch in amusement while Owen gets Professor Donner's help plan to kill his mother. In fact, first he goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, and then tells the professor that it's up to her to kill Mrs. Lift, "she has exchanged murders", as seen in Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train". director, DeVito not only complements the presentation of his actors with a scene that emphasizes dialogue, makes several bold visual testimonies, throws pieces of fun unreality to keep the audience on his toes (and far from taking things too seriously). <br /> Also to help matters is writer Stu Silver, who keeps laughter coming with his sensitive patter. "You have Oldsmobiles-sized rats." "She's not a woman ... She's a Terminator." "One little murder and I'm Jack Ripper." These are all Crystal words, but some of the funniest lines that work only in context but completely kill are DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently Silver never wrote another script after this, according to IMDb, and it is a shame because he had a real talent for it. The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was indeed used in its entirety as a theatrical presentation of "coming attractions", the only time I saw a movie promoted in this way. Owen presents his professor to his mother as 'Patty's cousin,' and when Momma says he doesn't have a cousin Patty, Mr. Owen loses. "You lied to me," he yells out, striking Mr. Professor's forehead. Of course, the professor didn't really make anything funny out of the floor, but "Throw your mother out of Train works efficiently at times when she plays her Looney Tunes for all her values." Of course, DeVito hasn't disappeared from the movies, but it's a mystery why he didn't really take part in the film's promise. Perhaps it is because, as he points out, "Throwing Momma out of the train, the lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision is not for every taste." This is too bad for those of us who can keep track of it and like it.
