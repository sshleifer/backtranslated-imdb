It was very sensitive very deep. It's my favorite all the time you don't see a movie deeper than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon became her mature actress and realized her role. She deserved the award. She convinced me that I was a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this deep masterpiece.
