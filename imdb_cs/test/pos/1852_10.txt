My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I was lucky to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised at how fun and fun this movie is. David Duchovny was very tempting because the male leadership and Minnie Driver gave her usually a competent performance. Some scenes laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with colleagues "transplant" done. I liked that it was a movie that I could watch with my kids and I wasn't embarrassed by any scenes. Everyone in the cinema laughed and enjoyed. Thumbs Up Bonnie Hunt!
