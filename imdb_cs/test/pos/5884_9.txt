So many great talents have been used in "The Best Years of Out Lives", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think about what his director William Wyler faced; as a result of a military victory over the statistical powers that committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world in the battle, he created a film that claimed that US leaders were deeply against the individual - that "they wasted the best years of the lives of those who were designed or bewildered in battle against war - which, since ignoring the rights of individuals, was nothing more than an argument about the degree of slavery that should have existed under. There are beautiful sets of Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's cinematography, and screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood, author of "Road To Rome" and other individuals defenses against tyrannical ideas. An ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia May, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael into an extensive but thematic drama. The clever line was the experience of your "couples" after the soldiers (three of them) tried to return home to a "culture of victory" and their bitter experiences and to realize their own need to fight what is happening in the world. homefront represents a strong and sober counterpoint to the conventional concept that is being sold that "everything was fine with" America. March and his wife have a terrible time to adapt and drink; O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, hooks instead of hands and wonders, whether life is worth living, and the worst of all wives, Andrews, throws him for a dough guy and loses years, leading the employer to ignore or deny their rights to work his individual merits, to have, what he had before he was taken out of his life and thrust into the risk arena - for nothing and the loss of everything he ever had, three must face n to fight again, everyone for their happiness, and all three managed to find the courage to continue fighting - everyone for their own happiness, which is now threatened by the curiously anti-self, anti-reality indifferent non-American of the United States.Wyler's direction, especially the scene where Andrews sits in the ko The B-17 bridge itself, and the scene of Russell's wedding, is truly amazing, the strongest movie and a big movie that can agree on a woman and a man. Hugo Friedhofer's music and Irene Sharaff's costumes contribute to his shine. One of the best and most unexpected movies of all time, in stunning BW.
