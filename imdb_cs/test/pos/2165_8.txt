Although it is a good, fun cartoon, they later did much better than Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first element of Star Trek that would be greeted with open arms and joy, no matter what the existing one is. This is really a patch of old pieces with a nice touch, but nothing special. It reminds me of a bit of hunting trilogy in points and the end is invaluable. It is certainly worth to watch the news and good pieces. Recommended.
