Sometimes the film is so bad that it's good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English so you have to get around it. Acting was also driven and forced, other than what the real rats that the IMO did a great job. He pulls himself to the rat. In any case, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs, and as a result, the local garbage collectors are striking, leaving large piles of garbage everywhere. This story was used before, not to mention that it happened in real life (unfortunately too often) and the audience is not surprised. But it's okay. We know what will happen and when, and sometimes viewers need a film in which it is not necessary to monitor many brain cells. We've got our hero to carved face and body, semifinals (heroes), and of course our hero, who becomes a doctor, but only in training, even if she finds out what's going on when so many people end up sick and dying, not just a rat bite. Of course, the villain must die (all right, all the villains, which means rats), and the final scene is one that reminds the audience that the sequel is in the works. This is one of those movies you just sit and enjoy what it is and what it isn't.
