If you want to have a great time then it's a movie to watch. Take the premise - There is this college that accepts people with a minimum qualification of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time you consume, so it's clear that all students are 40+. Also, the school admits students of "heavier" dispensing and has a P.Hd course in weight loss and the only student who failed this failure. Only she was a snake in her previous life. Still not convinced? OK read on. <br /> <br /> Here's the scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is chased by Arman and pulls a bazooka and shoots him! Then he throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But he does not die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, throws half a dagger into Akshay and stamps on it, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on the scooter and follows Arman. They fight, and Arman gives Akshay under water and Akshay is finally dead. So we think that once Arman is out of the picture, Akshay swims off Rajbabbar, the headmaster of this college + Boxing Refree + Professor Parapsychologie ka + mumbling priest. But nobody, I repeat no one takes the cake, but sure Mr. Nigam. You have to watch to learn more. :-)
