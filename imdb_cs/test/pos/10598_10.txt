"Haggard: Film" is well written, well-directed and well-functioning. There is a lot of laughing out loud moments and some amazing skateboarding scenes featuring Marger. West Chester, PA scenes are beautifully shot and the script is just downright funny. What I like about the film is that instead of being another love love story or another version of "Jackass", it takes a darkly funny look at the break-up from another perspective. Most of the smashed movies are a naive woman cheated by a cheating man. She then continues to find Mr. Right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost. This movie looks at the emotional roller coaster jilted man ... without getting too serious. Ryan Dunn has a great job as jilted man and Bam Marger and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends who are trying to help you at this rough time, how can you take something too seriously? Obviously, Marger and Co. they are incredibly talented both behind the camera and in front of the camera. I look forward to their future films and efforts.
