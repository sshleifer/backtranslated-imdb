Food always makes a good topic in movies, as "Chocolat" showed. "Babet's hour" is the same. Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) is a French chef who, after the repression of 1871, flees his native country. He moves to a very religious Danish village. People in this village just have no pleasure. That means until Babette cooks one of her delicious dishes. It's not just that this movie deals with bringing entertainment to a place that it never knew. Like other Scandinavian movies (and non-Hollywood movies in general), it shows that the film can keep your interest free of blasts, chases, etc. This is one movie you can't miss. One more thing. Do you think the Danish word for "feast" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
