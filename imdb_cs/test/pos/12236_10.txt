In the changing world of CG and co-not animated animation etc., Faeries was a warm welcome to me at least. I think it is important that we once show these films, keep them, and help remind us where the originality and fun of the cartoons comes from. People talk about how boring it is because of graphics and stuff, but hey! Think about movies that will be considered boring if every movie looks like a new state that everyone and their mother are doing these days. Call me old-fashioned, but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings.
