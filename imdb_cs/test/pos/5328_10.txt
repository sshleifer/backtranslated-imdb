I was looking at external reviews (Ebert, etc.) For this movie and everyone was pretty much negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that everyone was doing the same thing. Critics were upset that the film focuses on what seems to be a nonsense murder of an autistic child. This is undoubtedly a disturbing picture. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that reveals why killing happened and blames it directly. They want the guilt to be filled and resolved. Well, this topic quo is a kind of movie that parodies. Like society, critics wanted a quick solution to move on to their next tragic opera. Maybe there's not a simple question to answer? There is much more that happened then what's on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what is happening, but rather to understand why. What bothers me so much is that everything that looks at the show is Spacey and Cheadle, who were both great (and generally). But there are other great performances than just two current Hollywood icons. Gosling gives incredible performance that only one of his extreme talents could bring. Somehow Gosling is capable of making the autistic child's killer sympathetic. I'm sure many are irritating. However, if one watches a movie, sees what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not evil. Malone is also at the top of his game as another confused young character. In principle, killing a child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and the way people deal with it, highs and lows, and how they sometimes try to help others solve their lives (which doesn't seem to work very well). There are a lot of good and bad things in this world, and with every action we have a direct impact on how much good and bad things will be done, and sometimes a confused attempt to do good can make the whole game worse. I think this is one of the more memorable movies ever and has an ending that is just as touching as anything in recent film history. I firmly believe that people should see this film with an open mind.
