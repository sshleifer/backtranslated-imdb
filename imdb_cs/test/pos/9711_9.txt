Where should I start? I sat down to laugh and be blown away! This movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser, more obscene, fun and fun than the first. That was exactly what I needed tonight. There are so many scenes in this movie that tell you "Oh My!" or "Ouch!" Every event and scene has been mastered and set to be coordinated so that they are even more perfect. I just say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor certain shots to avoid rating NC-17! It was so cheerful that they had to give it anyway! Incredibly Fun, Don't Miss!
