I have read harshly hidden comments about previous comments that show that this film showed a lot of homosexuals who broke their homosexuals. It couldn't be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three homosexual characters in it, and one of them is a victim of people's prejudices, such as the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of justice. Grandfather's father wasn't gay. The gentle scene of a soldier and his sergeant is a male bond at the crucial moment of death. But some people are appalled with a kiss and a welcome gut scene that flies from a man killed by a bomb. The focus of the film is on the equal relationship of Pip and the sweet girl and their face to their social commitment and parenthood. Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
