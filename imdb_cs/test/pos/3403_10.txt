I read this film completely as a child and still as an adult. To say it is even underestimated. My sister, brother and I watched it for one year in our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They stuck it from the television. Our parents were happy to hold us for one night, but they thought we should draw it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. It is not so! We have become fascinated. If they tried, they couldn't fire us. It has become a valuable annual tradition. We loved everything about it: time, romance, battle scenes, villains etc. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist the hate that psycho Bent with his constant SIR!? Classical! Plus, who can resist cheering wildly when Justin falls off the balcony? What a triumphant moment! I've always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song itself can tear me a little. This movie is incredibly moving and I invite someone to stick with it to the very end. It's worth it!!
