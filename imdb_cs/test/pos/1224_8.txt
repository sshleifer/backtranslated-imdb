That's a decent movie. Although a little short for me, it packs a lot of actions, gravel, common sense, and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character in this movie are doing a great job. Throughout the film, emotions and intensity were convincing and tense. It's not a typical fantastic expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie really at a price. My evening was great for this movie. This film is a direct traditional action movie with great acting, story and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character character characters were good and makes you think they were actually seeing the actual event that is taking place. Because I believe this film was made with a cheaper budget, its performance and quality were much higher.
