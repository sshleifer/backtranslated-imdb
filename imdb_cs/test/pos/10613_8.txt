It's a unique film because it gives us the only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic fame. Because he seems so reserved and devoted, he is ideal for the role of an unloved cad, who makes use of all the people around him. However in the fatally serious (no punishment intended) last act, when Coward must do like a Flying Dutchman, he is much less comfortable. But his journey with the epigram is peerless, and Hecht and MacArthur gave him some gems (MacArthur, indeed - he was a joke of the couple). The film is brilliantly illuminated by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement away from the storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr took care of one thing - a screen chat. (NOTE: H&M themselves have blink-and-you-miss-''s portraits like burns in the flophouse scene). The most notable supportive player is one and only Alexander Woolcott, the notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both MacArthur and Coward, who appears to be one of the bitter authors, has always been waiting in Coward's reception room. Curious that Woolcott would agree to make a film that clearly reflects the legendary Algonquin Round Table, which he was the founder, and MacArthur something auxiliary member. Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for Best Story, although this victory is probably due to more Coward's impressive presence than any brilliance on the land. It's Coward, Woolcott and the dialogue you remember ...
