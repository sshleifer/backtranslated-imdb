"Unconditional Love" begins with a great promise. As directed by J.J. Hogan, the film works great until the last third of the film when it falls on the face. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse have written a myriad of options that end in the end. It seems that the art team behind the film had great hopes of playing differently. The fact of the matter is that it is a film that looks in different directions on how to transfer it to a resolution that eventually fails. Don't get me wrong, the film is tremendously appealing and will resonate with many viewers. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast we decided to look. Extremely talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice for playing Grace Beasley, a woman who found out at the beginning of the movie that everything was wrong in her marriage. Mrs. Bates is an excellent actress who deserves much better, even though her character doesn't help her, what the filmmakers do to her. Rupert Everett is always reliable to look after her. His role, as late Victor Fox's lover is well written, that is, until Dirk is lured into coming to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It's bizarre and defies all the rules of logic. Dirk doesn't seem to be able to hurt the flies, let alone hunt the killer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, incredible funny, Maudey. As Meredith Eaton plays, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the movie. It's rude and says how he sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best film actors, has nothing to do with the film; is absolutely useless. Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and the end of the film, and Max doesn't make any sense. He seems to want changes in his life and marriage, just to return to Grace without any explanation, everything forgiven. English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better chance than hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a song singing spirit. Julie Andrews makes a funny post in several priceless scenes. Finally, Sally Jesse Raphael's TV show is off and adds nothing to the movie. It's best to hear Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Mrs. Bates is the best excuse to stay.
