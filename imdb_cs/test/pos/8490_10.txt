Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this strong way through the life of blind, emotionally concerned, African American pop jazz genius, Mr. Ray Charles. Although the cast is amazing, Mr. Foxx earned more than just Oscar. If you could name an actor in the coming years, I'd think about it for Mr. Foxx. Foxx is not just playing Charles, he will create it again. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (inspiration for his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film. The dramas of Charles's struggle with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, dependence and success are neatly woven into the tapestry of his music. Music is beautiful, the script is, if I can say, perfect, and acting is nothing less than legendary. The director's method of film requires discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambiguous about - has had to choose what aspects of Mr. Charles's wider and more comprehensive life story would tell his story most sincerely, dramatically and understandably. Although some disagree (ostensibly wanting a dramatic biopic site) I believe he has chosen his themes admirably. Much of the success of this film is its consistent focus on several enduring themes in Karl's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and the guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deeply rooted fear of responsibility for second. Charles is portrayed as a man fighting bravely against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could imagine one of the men I listened to on my old turntable with my father in the living room on Sunday night while the football matches were on TV. And in "Ray, nothing was sugar coated." Topics are transmitted with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that covers the length of his long and illuminated life. The strength of these themes, the powerful script and direction, music and acting make it one of the most enjoyable and distinctive biographical films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
