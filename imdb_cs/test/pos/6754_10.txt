I still can't believe that an old man made this film back in 1934. Animation is just perfect, and what's amazing about it, with all the advanced technologies we have today, are few animation studies that are capable of producing a little gem like is this one. It has it all: a great story, beautiful chracters (though it is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects ... well, that is definitely not a children's movie, but it is necessary to see for anyone who is seriously interested in animation.
