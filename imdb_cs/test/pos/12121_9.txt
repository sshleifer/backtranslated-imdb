Great movie about American G.I. who leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. Does it accept it, but does it because it really likes it or because it can be supported by easier access to food and the like? Meanwhile, her brother and old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Werewolves, whose aim is to expel people (perhaps you will remember the same group playing a major role in Lars von Trier's Europa (Zentropa)). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the TV series The Dukes of Hazzard in the 1980s, is as shocking as an American. Should He Be A Big Movie Star? at this age, he reminds me very much of Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. Fuller's direction is pretty good, using a lot of long takes again (though not nearly as complicated as it was in Park Row, the long takes more often than not long, large dialogue scenes). The only problems lie in the script as it seems to be in all the Fuller movies I've seen. It's not too bad, but it should have been expanded, to complement the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, wife, is undergoing a major change, but off screen. Therefore, the emotional center lies directly on Best's shoulders. Fuller also had to kill a sick mother early in the film. I hope it doesn't sound too hard! She just does nothing in the film except lying in bed. It has so few lines. But Fuller keeps bringing her closer as the film continues. I'd reinforce her death with David and Helga himself. The film ends too suddenly and lacks a reward. These are not the biggest mistakes in the world (the way I described them makes them sound bigger than them). 9/10.
