I have read all the negative reviews "Anna Christie". You know, the fixtures about the static camera, the outdated acting, and the verbalism of the script. But when I saw it yesterday, I found it remarkably impressive and pleasant. Clarence Brown's camera remains largely immobile and I'm sure one of the microphones was hidden in the ship's light. Yeah, there are many dialogues and no spectacular action sequences. It's a morning talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... then there's Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all proving that great acting is timeless. I believe "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most famous performances. And it's a wonderful show from Divine, in a role that is really unusual for her. Yes, we saw Garbo tired and almost defeated, but never with bags under her eyes or knocking on shots of whiskey. Garbo played so many (delicious) costume roles that seeing her play the current woman is fascinating. Not weighted with heavy clothes or makeup. This show seems to be completely raw from Garbo. O'Neill follows the tired Swedish ex-prostitute Anna and her meeting with her slave from the sea. Anna had enough trouble for every girl in her twenties when she talks drunk, clever Martha (Dressler) at the bar. She finds solace in life at sea, and romance with a rough, but good fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to destroy everything. Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of (mostly worse) leading men. She is one actor who can really share the screen with her and not buy it with a magical presence. The couple has great chemistry and seemed to enjoy it. Dressler can never be accused of cheating, and again is a big dame up to her old tricks, but she's amazing and convincing in her role, never as uncomfortable as in the scary "Dinner for Eight". I've never heard of George F. Marion before, but he was as wonderful as Garbo's father. This is a pre-Code and somewhat rough and dark MGM standards. I really liked it, and when it growls in some places, it's still amazing.
