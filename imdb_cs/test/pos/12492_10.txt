"Quai des Orfevres", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a treasure trove because it is one of the best exponents of French filmmaking in the post-war years. M. Clouzot, editing Steeman's novel "Long-term Defense", shows his genius in the way he sets the story and the way he connects all the characters in this deeply satisfying film, which, as DBDumonteil pointed out in this forum, demonstrates how influential Cluzot was how much the next generation of French filmmakers is in debt to a master, especially Claude Chabrol. Armand Thirard's Crystal Black-and-White Cinematography has been beautifully transferred to DVD Recently we have watched the criteria. In collaboration with Clouzot Thirard uses most of the dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. Franti≈°ek Lopez's music, a man who created light music and operetta in France, works well in the context of the film, as the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. Louis Jouvet, considered a police detective, is perfect in this section. This was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was the pillar of French theater. Jouvet clearly understood the mechanics to create his police inspector, who is wiser and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and finally steal the show from others. In a dishonest comment on someone on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Columbo Peter Falke, a television detective. Honestly, and without respect for Mr. Falk, it's like comparing big champagne with good home wine. Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous husband. Blier had a face with which you could connect with a man who was kidnapped by the passion that his wife, Jenny Lamour had awakened. Martineau is vulnerable and not rational; it is an easy suspect because he did everything wrong when he finds himself in the middle of a crime he did not commit, but all the evidence points to the contrary. Another great character in the movie is Dora, a photographer. It's clear how she communicates with Jenny, where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically attractive as this troubled woman and contributes to the film. Suzy Delair, playing Jenny, is as attractive as a singer who suddenly jumps from darkness to celebrities and attracts men like Brignon, an old lecher. The film is one of the best Clouzots that have been filmed during his remarkable career and the one that will live forever because of the way he brought all the elements with him.
