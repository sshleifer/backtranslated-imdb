We all played Halo and Socom and GTA and Resi etc, but none of them can stand in GE007. The game itself is great. I literally burned my N64 playing this great game, along with Zelda OOT. This game itself has built a form that is essential for all modern shooters. moreover, multi-player is great. Story mode itself is worth playing 100 times more and more. It's a great game when your board and you just want to shoot some people and there are endless unlock ables. (Cheats, Aztec, Egyptian, God knows how many multiplayer charters and three difficulties, as well as the famous "007" difficulty. Newer online shooting games rarely see these two on two death-style matches, and when we don't do what's close to such good games, and when you're bored of the story, there are Endless Secrets, Defects and Easter Eggs that can be found and used. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the greatest shooters of all time.
