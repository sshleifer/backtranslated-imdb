This film is a piece of study for my English class, but it is depth and meaning impressed me. Because we closely follow all the facts and figures in this film, its an interesting story about love, hate, war, and prejudice. Well recommended! The Story: A Girl Named Jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, then hides him in her house in the vast gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see other qualities and earn each other's love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (prisoner of war) almost throws out his envelope to protect her, but patty can stop him before anyone sees him.
