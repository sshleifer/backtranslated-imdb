It's all a fine film about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often does something out of something that it deserves, but why are people not "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. Yes, they run and set the ideal life, but that's a movie, not a real life. Paul is more sexually interesting than Michelle, who was taken in the wrong way. They finally have sex, but nobody is forced to do it. The film allows children to know that sex can cause children. One thing is that there is nudity in movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there. The end of the movie has a good chance for Paul to be found. In "Paul and Michelle", they separate for a time. If you don't like the end of the movie, think about yourself. Alternative ends are not just for DVDs.
