Alice enters the Wonderland ... but not the wonder you remember as a child. Mad Hat, White Rabbit, Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alence some things about her body - and other people's bodies - that might be quite amazing. A story of love and lust you've never seen before. Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say that in the 1970s it may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe it is her only movie before going on mainstream work, but it was almost the best she could choose (my love for all things Alice is not a secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really pornography, so much). <br /> <br /> The songs are cheese, but they fit the theme of film. One song: "What is a girl you do to a knight like this?" it was pretty funny and others had similar themes. The process towards the end was well written and fit very well into the world of Alice. Logic and humor were definitely counted. <br /> <br /> What more can you say about such a movie? All I know is for people who are accustomed to adult movies, where it's just a 30-second head start for sex, this will overwhelm you with plot and music. But personally, I think there is something special about this movie and I hope it will have a nice DVD release with the touched things and special features (if possible). I see it's a cult film.
