So when I first saw the ads for Greek, I had some questions about how they were about to go to Greek life if they were going to decipher the sacred secrets of brothers and associations if they focused on brotherhood and brotherhood sisterhood. or sorority brings or what most college kids think of Greek life as a huge party. Fortunately, it covered everything. The story of the story was great, gave you the character to love, hate, someone you want to be, someone you don't want to be, and, of course, a crazy roommate! one of my first glances at what writers believed to be Greek life, and I can honestly say they hit the nails pretty dead. <br /> <br /> I love how one of the biggest things that goes on throughout the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to leave home and is forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, then come to find out .. you have nothing to do. Probably every college tied up the worst nightmare. Rusty Sister Casey was quite a typical girl on campus. What wasn't it? It is true. Evan for himself. Rebecca and Evan had an "affair" early in the season, making you feel pretty nice with Casey. Her character evolved and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and outgoing. Cappie is one of the funniest loving characters and totally crazy. One of my favorite episodes included his getting completely confused at the strip club and Rusty having to call Casey Bail them out. I like the way homosexuals have been concerned in Greek houses, Calvin was a very real feeling, and I really respected him because he kept his standards. So Just K was pretty crazy, but Rusty liked her. It was surprising and I kept on asking from the beginning, but of course I wanted it to be between her and Rusty. I'm definitely looking forward to the return of Greece. This will take you to the truth of Greek life, something many people will see. One of the greatest things about brothers and associations is party and drinking. Greek is a great show and characters are easy to apply.
