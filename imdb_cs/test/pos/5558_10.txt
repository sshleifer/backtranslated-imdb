Farscape absolutely the rules! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon Five, although there are only 7 major characters in the series (including the spacecraft). Humor is excellent and writers manage to keep an interesting show, even though everything is happening on the ship. What I really love and appreciate in Farscpa is that CGI does not use characters for foreigners or, if so, it is unobservable. They use those cute, lousy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you definitely want to look into if you don't already have one.
