Want to know why the French and Italians love each other / hate each other? Do you want to look into the history that drives our lives? So let's take a look at Virzi's film (in the original language, of course) and see the beautiful Monica Bellucci who speaks her native language from Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just on the Tuscan border). And the rest of the characters speaking Livornese (beautiful Sabrina Impacciatore and all the others). Daniel Auteuil definitely in shoes with Napoleon. Lots of fun, the real fresco of the Elba Island landscape and a picture of political reasons to kill or leave a living tyrant (good for all times).
