This is a movie that finally put me on line to sign up with IMDb to vote for (and comment). I recently came to appreciate the well-produced "war" movies, and that's one of the most elaborate things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "Stunning" is a word that comes to my mind when I think of this viewing experience. My husband and I were watching this movie for the first time. It is softly moving, but exciting (not contradictory). This story in the hands of Hollywood could only become another sad, action, top gun time loss. The two main actors playing Francis and Karl have played great with each other; and Kry≈°tof Hadek is a very "handsome" boy, without exaggerating or using it. As for Hadek's acting skills and appearance, my husband said (on the tongue), "Well, he's not Tom Cruise." I said, "Thank God!" If you appreciate the beautiful and unobtrusive behavior, look at this one.
