This film deserves a lot of praise for me because although I am not a surfer or skater, I have been inspired by the whole documentary. The depth of the history and development of these two extreme sports has highlighted what they were able to do for two groups of individuals. The devotion that these people have is really inspiring, and it was because others can now enjoy and do what these guys set up. Unlike most other documentary films, this was cleverly designed. The number of shots that have been recorded and survived for decades is excellent, and it was because some of the biggest adjustments I've ever seen have been put together and the result is that the subject has remained focused. No compulsion to be backed by recent footage of more famous surfers and skaters who are popular today. The film explores areas such as success, such new tricks, winning competitions and winning fame. Like failures such as injury or burning. It was also accomplished to hear the experience of skaters and surfers themselves, and not of second-hand information. The result was a better picture. Overall, the truly excellent effort.
