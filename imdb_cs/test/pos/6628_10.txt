Bergman's story of how the hell of a war can control barbarism is a sensible pair of musicians. With many unforgettable scenes throughout the film, I found it particularly remarkable that it was coming to an end where Ullmann and Von Sydow were going on a ship completely surrounded by corpses of sailing ships. A fascinating masterpiece!
