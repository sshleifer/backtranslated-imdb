Few would argue that the animation master Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too many of them focus on John Lassiter's "amazing" ability to steal other film charts, turn them into a beautiful puppet show and then be praised as a genius ... but also turn.) < Miyazaki gave us a film after a film that deals with important mature questions (usually ecologically motivated) and has an intelligent scenario that even the tired viewer who would normally despise any movie that was animated could thoroughly look forward to getting a chance. Yet Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these films - children. That means I don't intend to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else will you have a movie that will sit three years old (my nephew Link) all the time, fascinated, 7 year old (my niece Amber) who loves him all his own (and can appreciate the star) power "Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, 12 year old (my nephew Aaron), who is a review, was "of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san is good! "directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with mother characters (and also bet on older charas) and loving" cute "baby characters. <br /> < And this is what I most respect for Miyazaki-san, it seems to speak with his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker, a simple story about a little girl who gets the taste of the human world and wants to join her and a friend he does there, a little boy named So ske (somewhat like a "little mermaid"), but there is a whole different level of play here. in the nursing home there are all the real characters with their own strong minds. <br /> <br /> the girl who eats the cake is Ponyo herself, and once she decides she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to reach her Her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magic fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes a mere human being. Once a man connects with his friend Soske, whom he loves very much (though perhaps not as much as a ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother Lisa decides to help people in the rest of her home where she works during a typhoon that was unintentionally caused by Pony on her way to becoming human. Frankie Jonas (yes. Is it related to Jonas' brothers. Can we get around what you like?) Gives the best performance in the film as a young Soske (which is good because he has the most lines). His character is also a strong will, but also very considerate and friendly - the qualities you probably won't find in a child's figure on this side of the Pacific Ocean. Finally, Pony's father, Fujimoto, has to deal with his daughter's decision, and his determination wife wants her to be human. He hopes Ponyo and Soske will "remember" him. Once again, Miyazaki condemns the character to become a stereotypical "bad guy". Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) some criticism for this, that is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. Nobody in real life is completely "bad man". All people are different shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. And then there's the animation itself. At a time when CGI would certainly help with a number of effect shots in this film, especially in the water, Miyazaki decided to incorporate NO CGI at all. Of course, hand-drawn animation was colored with digital means, but every movie in this movie was stretched by hand and I'm very grateful for it. Character animation was extremely fluid, and there seemed to be some sort of lip sync (quite unusual for anime movie). The background seemed to be drawn with a colored pencil and affects the audience. This is what animation looked like - and what it should look like. Finally, I found out that Ponyo is very nice. It's certainly not the best Miyazaki (in my opinion, this honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but it's still a 10-star entertaining movie for the ENTIRE family.
