This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". With Justin Walker, Corey Feldman, and James Remar, it has had one plot after another. However, this film is not for everyone. If you don't like movies that "go all the way" with respect to violence, then don't look at the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn't look at the screen. This is a really bold, realistic teen drama. I can't believe it came from King B-movie Roger Corman. This film needs to be seen for those who are not weak hearts. Highly recommended.
