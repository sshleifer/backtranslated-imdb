Death Bed: The Bed That Eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the name, you can guess what this film is all about. And yet there is a much more (background) story to this film then one might suspect. Well, so the main plot is about bed eating people and food, but there are also several subplots. I won't spoil them, but they're a nice touch. Sadly, acting in this film is very average. The fact that most dialogues and actors do not speak in fact does not help to improve the quality of film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of voice work. The characters' thoughts are also revealed to observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. <br /> <br /> The effects are fine. Sure, it could be a lot better if you compared it to today's movies. But you really shouldn't; Judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. You have to admit that the BED killer is pretty creative. If you're scared, don't watch this movie. You may never want to sleep again ... Dead Bed: A bed that is a strange, low budget horror jewel, but I would recommend it to horror movie fans. In conclusion, I can give this movie 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected twists and turns.
