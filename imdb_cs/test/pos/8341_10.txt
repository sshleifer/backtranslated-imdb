Too many Christian films are centered around fear of judgment and consequently face condescending and indomitable. "The second look" is right. This is an almost perfect evangelical instrument; deals with the real reason why so many young people do not want anything to do with Christianity. It ensures viewers have to give up sin - not their entertainment - to succeed in a Christian lifestyle. The "second look" even works as a piece of film. The creators seemed to be working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a dynamic scenario to distract viewers from this obvious fact. This film brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere it shows, it certainly has more people than me.
