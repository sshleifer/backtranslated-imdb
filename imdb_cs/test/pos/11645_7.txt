Before I see this film, I suggest that the viewer postpone all expectations that the victims of the depicted crimes will have the same treatment and consideration as the perpetrator. There were many films about victims of crime. This one is about the killer. "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers to save William Poncelet and no dramatic twists of stories. The film does not try to put it in good light; he is guilty, he is repulsive, he is racist and was responsible for the abominable murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: despite his crimes, look at him as a man. In this way, the film questions the view that the death penalty provides "justice". Whether for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the culprit can find redemption, inequality in the justice system, and the appropriateness of the death penalty. Great Performance by Both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Especially the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's abilities.
