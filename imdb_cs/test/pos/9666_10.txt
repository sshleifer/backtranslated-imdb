Looking back to 2002 when "Furia" was made, it is easy to recognize the singing singing of today's new generation in Romania. <br /> <br /> The main features of "Furie" stand in a very solid scenario, with a substantial dramatic core and truly professional development, plus the cast of outstanding actors. All four lead roles are admirably performed, both with depth and randomness: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu have confirmed that since they are now two of our top players, Dorina Chiriac is following them closely and Adrian Tuli, unprofessional ( in real life, the cemetery manager!) cast like Gabon, it was a real revelation! Furthermore, the director Radu Muntean is skillful and expressive, creating a feeling of "fateful night" and inevitable destiny in a very impressive style. One can easily go through a few embarrassing and even unsuccessful moments, because time proved that they were only uncertainties of their own debut, never repeated in his subsequent films: "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie".
