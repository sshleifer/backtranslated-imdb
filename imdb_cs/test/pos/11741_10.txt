He is a war correspondent, William Holden, who falls in love with the stunning Eurasian doctor, Jessica Jones, who stands on Hong Kong's stunning background. Cinematography is amazing when they meet on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. The story deals with racial tension, a society that focuses on mixed relationships and extramarital affairs. But what I like about her is the strong character of the heroine depicted by Jessica Jones, who is a Eurasian doctor and who remains humble and persistent in her altruistic mission and remains true to her love. Despite being thrown away in her hospital for cavorting with a married man by scrubbing high dignitaries. One day, William Holden is called to the Korean War he covers, and then that bad fateful day, he gets a report of his demise. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried as she went up the hill. It was a very sweet sick love. That beats all the chances, the fact that she was thrown out of her job, as his wife did not divorce him, but their great love persisted - despite all the great love they had. I personally do not believe in extramarital affairs and I think he should not start something when he is tied to someone else, and he should not afford to make it happen, but in spite of that a really spectacular movie. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is stuffy and has a wonderful performance, though I thought it was strange to not hire a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with one rating, Jessica Jones radiates sexuality as she lies on the floor and looks at William Holden talking calmly, but her eyes say they'll take me now. I'm sorry that most of the great movies were made before I was born, and many Hollywood movies seem to be lacking in depth, great acting, and entirely dependent on pieces and heavy sex scenes. This is really one of the biggest unhappy love stories in movies.
