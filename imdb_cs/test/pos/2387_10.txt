I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The film had all the components I was interested in watching. Especially I loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising end. Craig Morris has the potential of Brad Pitt in both appearance and talent. Blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter took this film to a new level. I loved the cast. Music scores, cinematography, talent, location and script were amazing. I loved to see some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his job 200%. The film has a great structure. I hope Eddie Monroe 2 will be there. Eddie Monroe, Fred Carpenter's, is Hollywood.
