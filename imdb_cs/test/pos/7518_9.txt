Anyone who goes to Manhattan Hospital Center takes his life into his hands. This includes Hospital staff. I've never seen a Hospital before and I was intrigued by how similar figures and conspiracy situations were to another Paddy Chayefski masterpiece, Network. There are elements in George C. Scott's character who have both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale. He is a hospital administrator and is angry like hell and won't take it anymore. He is totally alienated from his wife and children. It takes Faye Dunaway type character in the person of Diana Rigg to make him rip out of it. One roll on hay with her and he is shocked back to reality and the fact that he can still contribute in the world. But first he has a real problem. Someone is out of the hospital staff killing, four of them in 48 hours. And a nice part is their death, which is largely attributable to the general incapacity of medical bureaucracy. This is where comedy comes. There is a real character of Howard Beale type in the person of Barnard Hughes, the father of Diana Rigg's. His end is not as dramatic as Beale's. <br /> <br /> In my working days, my job was to pay medical contractors. Some of them might be as big as you would be in a hospital. The black satire comedy had some real bite on it for me. George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but after winning and refusing to take the previous year's Oscar for Patton, he wasn't about to get a second chance. Lost with Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Yet his control of this role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to look back at the hospital with the network to see how many similarities you will notice.
