I watched this movie with high expectations, but I was a little disappointed. Although I like this movie and was immersed in the story, I didn't find it moving and I think the end is over. The story consists of a man's friendship who runs a photo store and his best customer. who is a traffic policewoman. The place is a picturesque Korean village. This film is, in some ways, realistic because it is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic. However, I was not eventually relocated by a film that portrays a man who loves a woman so much but does not give her the opportunity to enter her life. In my mind it's a sweet, noble loser. Good Points - Outstanding Leadership of Two Leaders, Pleasant Shot of Village Life <br /> Disadvantages - Flat End <br /> <br /> Overall - Good, but I prefer movies before sunrise and after sunset (or before sunset and after sunrise)
