In & Out is a simple comedy. Admirably succeeding in the mission of being funny and fun. Kevin Kline is predictably in excellent shape in this film, along with Tom Selleck not playing on his expected "square jaw" leading male type. Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and shows a nice sense of comedy timing. The cast makes this movie a success. Not all homosexual movies are designed to support some sinister, hidden Hollywood liberal agenda. Part of this movie is that the viewer is thinking, then it was a byproduct of the well-functioning work of a great cast of professionals. I often found myself in the right moments. Fixed "B."
