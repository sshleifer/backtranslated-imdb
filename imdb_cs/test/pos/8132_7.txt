Although I saw this movie dubbed in French, so I'm sure it lost something in the translation, lack of accents, etc., This was an excellent, fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room - a real pick-me -up that exactly and has positively portrayed the complexity of individual sexuality, gender roles, and finding a place in the communities one should belong to - man, gay, urban, 30, etc. I was very proud of French television for showing such an honest and positive view of gay community. While the fact that a homosexual leader eventually ends up being "straight" is slightly disappointing, that is life, and that sometimes happens. This is a great movie, either alone or with a date! Really enjoyable experience.
