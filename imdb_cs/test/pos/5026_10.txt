honestly, I loved Michael. although there was "give me a pillow I need to take a nap" part, it was fine. I think everyone did a great job in this movie. and Nora Ephron is in my "ok" list of directors. It's nice to see John Travolt as an angel with a belly. it's not often when I see one in the movie. some people might call it a boring movie, but I loved it for me. angels and everyone.
