One True Thing rises over its potentially clever material to give us a glimpse of a family of complex relationships and wrong, real people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger to discuss her mother's death with the district attorney; saving us cheap film shots of "shocking" illness and death. From there, he looks at a family system in which everyone plays a set of unexplained rules and uses mother cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. William Hurt as a confident father and Meryl Streep as Suzy Homemaker's mother are both excellent; nuances and not what seems to be. Zeleweger is ugly, angry and surprised by himself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well. The story is predictable and lasts for at least one bad jerk, which it may not have, but the performance and view of the family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, worth it.
