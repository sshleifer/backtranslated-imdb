On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, a sick sister, her life slowly subsides, requiring David Holm to be presented at once. We don't yet know who David Holm is or why his sister wants to see him, but her only desire to die is to talk to him again. On the other side of the city, he sits comfortably between the tombstones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken co-workers await the arrival of the New Year. "Here we can say when to drink the New Year," shouted Holm, throwing a finger at the large clock tower that stretches through the darkness. Few know, however, that he will not be alive to welcome him. In order to pass the time, Holm recites a spiritual story. He once had a friendly name, George, a "jolly man" who was "smarter than the rest of us". For a New Year's Eve a few years ago, George split up a potentially disastrous brawl because he was afraid that the last man who would take his last breath before midnight would be sentenced to run a phantom car next year, make Death's offer, and collect souls. of the deceased. "And gentlemen, George died last New Year's Eve!" Holm concludes happily, not worrying that he contains his mocking skepticism of male conviction. Of course, how unfortunate it is, the unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, just at midnight stroke. As the transparent spirit of man rises from his earthly body, the distant approach of the phantom carriage testifies to his horror. The driver, a fragile veiled figure - a coat tightly clasped in his hand - steps away from the carriage and approaches. We are surprised to find that the driver is none other than the dilapidated George who is preparing to hand over his gruesome duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Due to the era in which Körkarlen is being produced, the special effects in this film are superb. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used a double exposure photograph to create a scary, scary silhouette of a carriage and his damn driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A particularly impressive scene includes a phantom chariot traveling to the bottom of the ocean to gain the soul of a drowned man. The next scene, tremendously reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining", includes Holm, who breaks the kitchen door with his ax to reach his fleeing woman and children. Victor Sjöström's truly ominous "Körkarlen" and his commotion in his execution is a great work of cinematography that successfully portrays Holm's perpetual alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and the ultimate hopeful possibility of redemption.
