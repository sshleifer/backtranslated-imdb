Lady and Tramp II are very colorfully animated and songs, especially those related to Junkyard dogs, are pretty good. However, the family seems to be too idyllic and I cannot understand that Scamp is dissatisfied when everything is forbidden. However, I am also sorry for an Angel who has never had a loving family until he meets Jim Darling and Darling. In any case, it is clear that the original lady and Tramp are better than this sequel.
