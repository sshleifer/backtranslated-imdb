Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. It is a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who were accidentally brought back to Earth during the last shuttle mission. Steve Railsback as the only surviving tragedy. But really the movie people are just a showcase of the natural beauty of Mathilda May. It's one steaming hot number. The director was a big fan of the female vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May restores the title role of Lina Romay The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There's a lot of gore effects that keep fans of genres happy. <br /> <br /> I have to give this movie a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. During this period he made three interesting films for Cannon (Texas Chainsaw II Massacre and also Invaders from Mars). If you like science fiction / horror movies, Tobe Hooper movies or Mathilda I wish this movie is just on your alley? <br /> <br /> Top Recommendations! Did I mention Mathilda May smoking hot?
