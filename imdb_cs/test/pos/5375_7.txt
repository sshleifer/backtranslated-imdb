This totally special feature is a typical and first-class example of satanic horror of the 1970s. The events are confusing and it takes a long time to figure out what the hell is going on, but the exciting atmosphere swallows you up. Right from the indescribably bizarre Intro, showing a few frightening children who turn toys into real war machines, you know that this has become an uncompromising and bold shock. The "Satan Brotherhood" soon appears to be another installment in the alleged and unofficial "spooky little town hiding a dark secret" sub genre. A young widower traveling with her new wonderful girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter stops in a remote town to report a road accident they have witnessed on a nearby highway. Villagers behave very hostile and insist that visitors leave now. The city is clearing out in an atmosphere of fear and panic, as local children disappear inexplicably extinct and unnatural forces keep everyone within the city's boundaries. Hillsboro is in the grip of Satanic cult, apparently dominated by older members of the community. I really liked the "Satanic Brotherhood". The story reminded me of John Saul's novel, but I can't remember the title. She also looked at the cult of the elderly who abused juvenile villagers for their greedy merits. The film relies mainly on scary scenery (such as dolls and witch relics), but a little more involvement and a coherent scenario would be nice. The subject often raises many questions and questions, and director Bernard McEveety cannot always give us answers. The peak is amazing, very seventy (which means shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot film.
