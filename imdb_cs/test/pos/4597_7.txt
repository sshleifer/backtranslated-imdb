As a social satire, Idiot is as good as an office, but with a wider range. To criticize this movie as too childish due to the potty humor, it's kind of missed, I think. There are certainly fart jokes etc, but they are not really intended to be funny for the audience - there are defining the state of "culture" in the world of 2500 AD visited Joe, as a background to the bizarre state in which he wakes up. The real humor of the film lies in the many viewpoints and attitudes present in this future society, which are just a shade of what we encounter in everyday life and which should serve as a warning. My personal favorite is viewing Fox News. The subtle shine in the film lies in the fact that it also casts on "smart" people and average Joes as protagonists. Note the times in the movie when Joe and Rita almost subconsciously adapted to the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not designed to select any group of people, but above all the idiocy culture in general. I don't know what to say about Fox's behavior in the "conspiracy theory" of releasing this film, but if it doesn't play at your local theater, ask it. We all need to see this movie, if not for social commentary, at least for fart jokes ...
