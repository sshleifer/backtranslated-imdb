My one-line summary suggests it's not a good movie, but that's not true. I enjoyed the movie, but I probably expected it too much. Adele, who is firmly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, was not very likeable. She is powerful and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable measure if it were not for the enormous love she had for her daughter. That's one thing he knows how to do without failure. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy to be on her mother's shortcomings, which doesn't seem to be just 14-17 years old. As a result, Natalie Portman is the perfect choice to play Anna because she has never been 14-17 years old. Portman is pulling this role away with such ease that you will almost forget that he has not made films for 20 years. Yet, even with two fixed leads, Wayne Wang never seems to have pulled the audience quite as he did with Lucky Luck Luck and even more with smoke. While I haven't read the book, the film feels like it made the necessary changes to the story to make it on the big screen, changes that can drain the emotional sharpness of the story. I enjoyed a movie for fun when I watched two beautiful actresses doing their job, but I never got lost in my experience and I was never related to their difficulty.
