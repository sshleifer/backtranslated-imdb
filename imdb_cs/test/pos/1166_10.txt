One of the best movies I've ever seen must be the wind and the lion. Gad, scenes ... Raisouli's bandits are crawling with a wall ... An old British gentleman gets up from his tea with Candice Bergen and three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. Whispering from the Spirit of the Empire ... To Remember! Don't forget! USA Marines come ashore from long, long gone. They wore Krags, they were supposed to be Lees, but, wow. And Winchester 97 blows big holes into hard natives and even more hardened and unbelieving Europeans ... Raisouli - Sean Connery, o, Wow! - wondering "What kind of weapon does Roosevelt use?" Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, Wow! - Wondering: "What kind of weapon does Raisouli use? "and write one more angry letter to Winchester about his stock on his Winchester 95. Raisouli, armed with a sword ... Prussian cavalry officer, HOLSTERING his pistol, and drawing the HIS sword. who is long gone, but Raisouli would never go through a child-filled plane to the building ... <br /> <br /> Love the amazing best Milious and now the DVD.
