One of the myths of the early sound period is that they couldn't do Westerns because they had trouble recording the sound on the spot. In fact, it was a financial constraint on the depression that temporarily killed the genre, at least in budget class "A". However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn really dug, "Western" flourish, notable examples including Virginian, Billy the Baby and Cimarron. Maybe the great trail was the greatest of them? The Gargantuan Western Pioneer shot in the early widescreen process properly titled Majesty. With the recent DVD release, we now see a widescreen version next to the full screen that was shot simultaneously. The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the adventure spirit lay in vast outdoor vistas, making it the perfect choice in many ways. It uses a broader framework to show Western landscapes in the most beautiful environment. Very typical for Walsh is a series of shots to the beginning, such as where the woman is chopping wood. Most of the screen is filled with cars and other mess, but in one corner we see a wilderness that stretches. When the car starts to move, the open plane is gradually revealed to us, with the cars pulling away like stage curtains. These shots aren't as effective in full-screen design, but Walsh's face has never been better out on the wider screen. Unfortunately, this is an unfortunate flip. As for the dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendencies are that they place the actors in the center of the shot as if they were in an imaginary full-screen box. Extra width becomes just that? other. Initially, this may seem logical, because it means we see as many actors as we are in a full-screen picture. However it makes the player look small and insignificant within, while all the background business dominates the shot? There are plenty of business activities in the Great Trail. When widescreen formats appeared in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake before eventually realizing that in the talkie scenes it is better to put actors from around the chest, losing some of their height, but allowing them to fill the screen. It's a shame because The Big Trail is a very well balanced and gently written effort. Romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined, and do not threaten to overcome each other or pioneering story. It could be a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight, because every time characters start talking, we get attention from a herd of cattle, drifting cars, or anything else that fills every spare thumb frame. Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display and he can make the last scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice comedy touches, a very polite "comic Swede" El Brendel. The Big Trail is also remarkable for being the first leading role of John Wayne. While Wayne is another victim of distant framing in dialogue scenes, we see at least his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive voice. It will betray its lack of experience, but the potential is clear. Sadly, at that time, the potential was not widely realized and he spent the rest of the decade in B-frames before finally reaching the star. Also appearing in this picture is Wayne's buddy (and later prolific acting actor) Ward Bond. He is not credited, but you can see him in a number of scenes, most notably around the 80-minute mark where he stands on the left side of Tyrone Power. The Big Trail is a famous epic that manages to beat itself as a drama. And it was this huge scale that had certainly built a western (and wide-angle) screen for some time. And although the 1940s and 1950s are now considered the golden age of the West, then it was a changed genre, stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West? nothing better or worse, but another form. The time of the early interview was the end of an era in which Western people could be gigantic.
