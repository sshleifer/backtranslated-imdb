While some things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. Haggard succeeds Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo), trying to regain Glauren (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. The story is watched and developed surprisingly well, it's no wonder and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, though it has a side story that won't hurt the main story. And for all fans of Bam fans (and girls) there are several Bam skateboarding sequences, perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small performances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but meaningless) roll. If you hope to see a comedy and escape from Bam's folly, then don't give up on this movie, otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you find it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
