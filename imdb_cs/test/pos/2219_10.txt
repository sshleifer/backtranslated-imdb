This film explores whether it creates a completely new genre with perfect imperfection --- the cheerfulness, the truth, the fun, the talent and the circumstances that make for MAGIC. From creative music numbers to cuff comedy, which includes actors at their best, if I didn't know better, I'd think there was a sophisticated script. what you get: a powerful wind meets conversations with God who meets something so fresh and new and delightful that he becomes his own entity. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors, and all who have participated here should be tapped on their backs, taken to dinner and considered an Oscar. <br /> <br /> great!
