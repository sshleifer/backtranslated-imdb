I think I recommended the movie to the lady in the shop I hired him from! For once she was upset! What a great movie! At first I was convinced that James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and in the middle of the movie I was absolutely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and quite sure James McAvoy was also! Watching the special features on the DVD and seeing both actors in their "normal" robes, saying that I was blown away would be an understatement !!! I remember that in the 1980s, Dustin Hoffmann returned to his autism in "Rain Man" - frankly (in my opinion, of course!) Steven Robertson got out of the water - and deserves recognition as such! ! All in one of the greatest portraits of human friendship / love / relationship at all - and it was made in Britain / Ireland with home actors - keep it in your tube and smoke Hollywood!
