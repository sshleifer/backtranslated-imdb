This film, which is considered one of the recent dramatic dramas brought to us by Hollywood, stands out where others have failed completely (especially considering that Natalie Portman was the most dramatic performance in her latest dramatic portrait). unanimously guided by the chemistry shared by Susan and Natalie. They seem to be so natural during filming that you would mistake them as a real family. There are so many conflicts between mother and daughter in the story that are difficult to handle their acting skills. I feel that the talented performances of these two actresses have gone up where the story was missing and too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really saved the suffering. I would recommend this movie mainly to those who like one of the two actresses or such an above-average drama.
