There are a lot of movies we say must be seen twice. In most cases, it is mainly a recommendation: after the first viewing you understand the film and the second time you watch it when you manage to capture the plot that you just didn't notice. For Mulholland Dr. The sequence that worked for me was: the first time to look - spend the day on the Internet and try to figure out what it is all about - and then see it a second time. Otherwise, you are unlikely to be able to use this movie in its entirety. Then you begin to understand that this piece is brilliant, working with the camera is overwhelming and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. 9/10
