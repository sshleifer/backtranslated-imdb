My wife and I agree with all of the positive comments below from other IMDB members. While this is not a box smash hit it has a special charm all its own. Real and warm warming. <br /> <br /> We saw this on the video at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally, in such a situation, my wife sleeps in a matter of minutes, that is, if it is not an exceptional film and he has let us entertain the very end. Perhaps the younger viewers in their teens and the 1920s would not like it, but it is a real gem for the rest of us! You see it!
