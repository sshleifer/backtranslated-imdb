I love this movie. I saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and I had to rewind it so my sister could watch it. This movie is so fun. There are two times when I laughed so hard that my hips hurt me. I didn't expect to look at the movie so much fun; I really wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I first saw it in Titus, which is also an amazing movie. Like other reviewers, too many people expect a deeply moving movie. You won't get it. What you get is humor, eye candy, and the chance to ask exactly what your perfect friend would look like if you could create them. You can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. The cheerful succession includes Justin when he first sees himself as a naked man. I was cracking up. I swear this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen, and that's my favorite now. Just remember why movies were originally created; as entertainment is not philosophy in motion. Remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
