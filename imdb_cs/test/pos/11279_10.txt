What's This Movie: Cool, Entertaining <br /> <br /> What's This Movie: Visually Interesting, Difficult, Intentional <br /> <br /> I feel like giving this viewer (if she is willing) through a clip of the time they experience a world without language. Like animals, they must experience the world. You don't really watch this movie just like you are witnessing a terrible series of events in what "feels" like in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it goes much longer than it is comfortable. This movie could be edited for up to 20 minutes and it would be a completely different movie. It would be cool and fun, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of great movies, but I've never seen it before. If you can get your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but probably "enjoy") what they have achieved here. 10 of 10.
