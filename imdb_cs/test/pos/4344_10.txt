One of the most beautiful films ever made. Charles Buchinski's meeting (later known as Bronson) is simply excellent. This is the crown in the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted and said it was his masterpiece. The story was copied many times, but it was never covered. Wildey J. Moore, a gun maker, has argued many times that the growth of his brand since the mid-1980s can be fully attributed to DW3, and correctly. This is not just a movie, it is an art that many generations have admired and appreciated. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the US, it is a huge continuation in Europe and Asia, where it is regularly screened at film schools, and is still a popular hit in student cinemas across Europe. All in all, a real classic.
