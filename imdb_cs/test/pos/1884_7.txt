That was a funny movie. Just when I saw the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and didn't want more), I got as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including the really bad ones. This one is funny without being exceptional, but how original is it. I mean, you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyberggs, half of the brain madmen, gypsies, former KGB drivers, jealousy, passion murders, love, romance, sex, action, and more, all this is all same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see it and enjoy it, I can't explain it in the text box. I think it's not that cult movie like Evil Dead, but it's Bruce Campbell I love. Ted Raimi lends his hand, Tamara Gorski looks beautiful and interesting (on Friday, June 13, she made a long journey from the hooker) and Vladimir Kolev also promises many promises as an actor, though he is likely to be cast as a secondary character in Hollywood movies throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: a funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you will enjoy it.
