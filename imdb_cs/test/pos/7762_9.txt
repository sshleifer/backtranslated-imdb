Okay, let me start by not getting anime overall. I liked a couple of "quoted" classic series, but the medium as a whole, as well as American television, means that a good 90-95% of them is an absolute trio, with the rest falling anywhere from "traceable" to "decent". It's no wonder I don't like self-supporting parasitic anime. I don't get most of the jokes and the medium in itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't call me at all - loud, hyperactive, lowbrow, and over the top. So when I started watching this series in a friend's order, I was ready for disappointment after the first few episodes. I thought the characters were supposed to represent the clichés of the character from the trade story outline, and their actions were to be similarly satirical. I could see where it came from, but I didn't think it was all clever - a lot of "crazy, fun high school shenanigans and going on, we're just ironic about it now." "About the third episode, my opinion has changed drastically. <br /> <br /> It was at this point that the strengths of this series began to manifest itself. Jokes from the chronological order of episodes, its hoarse sense of self-awareness and, above all, clever humor Breath) Well done straight man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider This rarity in any medium represents this sophisticated, witty interaction between diametrically opposed characters, the protagonist of Kyon's constant feeling of vaguely resigned giving a perfect film for action which characterizes the general character of "anime-like" Haruhi. It's a break from formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this strong foundation, the series continues to succeed with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. previously mentioned, episodes broadcast from chronological order.It first considered it a trick, but it works surprisingly well. The sequence of events makes sense logically, but the order of episodes broadcast more closely follows the traditional structure of Aristotelian drama. The selected order does not leave any narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple derivation (but although it is possible to estimate what happened in the optional "previous" episode, one still feels compelled to see how these events evolve), and excellent planning prevents any drawing holes or contradictions. I watched this series a second time after it was finished and I was amazed at how well seemingly insignificant events were tied together. The last point testifies to the extraordinary attention to detail in every area of ​​the series. While the "anime" stockpiles are a little grateful, the background is excellent, realistically based on real photo links. Animation quality is also excellent at important points. For example, there is a musical performance late in a series in which characters are actually shown playing a song - that may sound trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching (movie quality) animation that really matches the audio track is incredible. Br /> <br /> In short, I like this series for some reason. In essence, it is something that I generally do not like, but its implementation is so unique and well done that I can't help it.
