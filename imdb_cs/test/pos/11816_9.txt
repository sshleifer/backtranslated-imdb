Although this movie is 11 years old, I rented it yesterday and found it to be a really moving movie. The story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and a moving impression. Although I didn't care about the amount of language used by some young actors - especially Renfro - I understand that art mimics life. Again, Renfro will do a great job of harsh and hard, very (and I think VERY) disturbed wannabe tyrant (his role in the Client in mind) and Mazzello does a great job of a funny, somewhat unpredictable, Dexter - a child who realizes that his life must end too early. While there are so many moving and witty moments in the film, I have to say that my favorite was when the boys were in the corner of Pony in an abandoned church, and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself, saying his blood was poison. Although very resourceful and somewhat entertaining, seeing an adult man running away from two young children, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. Be sure to check it out, but get ready with Kleenex - you will need it!
