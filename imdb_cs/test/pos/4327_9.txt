What is the meaning of these reports if you do not discuss and share ideas about next season ... Here is my prognosis: 1. The hatch was really deflated, but everyone inside survived. But let us know about it. 2. The tent end episode is an observation team following the tracking device installed on the Desmonds by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island had been lifted, the signal had been picked up by a watchtower and would send a rescue mission. 3. After the hatch is destroyed, the island is no longer isolated and other ships / planes arrive. 4. Others will finally share their secrets with the poor observers. Cheers Mike
