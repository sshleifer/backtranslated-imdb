At first I started watching The Outer Limits at the age of 95 when I was 10, and every week I blew up every episode, every episode had a twist and I couldn't wait for the next week. As writers have managed to make each episode so well and do it differently from everyone over the 7 seasons, it's over. This show can teach us about life, robotics, extraterrestrial and human encounters and seeing more paranormals, and how it affects people. What really makes it good shows are characters in every episode, really show emotions and are really good actors. What you notice every week is an actor / actress you know from a previous show that is pure in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to chill out and sit with a good Sci-Fi show, then the outside limits are for you
