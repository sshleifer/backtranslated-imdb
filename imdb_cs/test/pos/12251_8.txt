This is a love story built against the back drop of TV news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working in the Washington TV network office. Tom Grunick (Hurt) is a handsome reporter who prepares Jane (Hunter) is a producer who realizes that Tom lacks intellectual gravity to be a real journalist, but still falls. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is a man who shares his beliefs in journalistic standards, is also a man who really loves her. Holly Hunter was nominated for Best Actress Award but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!) She was robbed! This is Hunter's movie. Her character Jane is smart, ruthless and totally driven. She is also cheerfully neurotic. Her performance is perfect. Just watch her face as she looks at the tape of Tom's conversation with the rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes. The performance of William Hurt is less noticeable. He plays a man who is well aware that he is a man and a scam, but is smart enough to know that his ascension will be facilitated by people like Jane. He gives a little advice to a man who is extremely calculating. The film comments on celebrities, journalism, integrity, and business pressures on news in the media that is focused on the line. This predicted that the news would be confused, that the standards would slow slowly due to commercial pressures. Think about it: this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before the rise of reality TV. Yet it predicted that the Paris news from prison was the main news story! To see how prophetic this film is, just watch your evening news and notice the set, graphics, and moderators.
