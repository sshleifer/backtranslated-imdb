Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, a solid leader) leads a secret secret police unit called Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact laws. They get the job done in their own way without escaping the press, and it gives them the freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals the most working detectives and the policeman just can't catch up. Buddy has a childhood friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who exchanges information with him about the crowd types and shysters working in the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito hatches a scheme that uses names from Buddy's "checklist" (he has this book open with comments provided by Vito, but does not know that his friend copied those names that were written in his book) . set up crowd families in a series of crowd-carrying cash-abductions through two cops, the Moon (always criminal Richard Lynch) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this program breaks down when one in seven players is killed, Vito is afraid because he knows how Buddy can be when he is hopelessly hopped at something ... especially when his own is murdered. An extremely underrated police film has an exciting car chase through New York City when Buddy follows a bearable cop-cheater who tries to kill them after he kills his partner. The film is not too complicated to set up the plot, and we realize who the ring leader is in exploring the mafia. Scheider never got a loan that he deserves as a great actor. He has an emotional range and we see him losing his cop and collecting a tax on him. The film is sharply paced with good action sequences and creates an interesting plot of betrayal among friends because greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what appears to be a smooth criminal spree against evil crowd families can kill cops.
