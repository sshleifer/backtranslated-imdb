This film was very interesting to me, practically a film in a film that is about a very whimsical director who cleverly convinces the actress and actors (who don't like each other) in producing sexual chemistry on film. The director is faced with fusillade obstacles when trying to get both individuals to perform beautifully on the film. Sex is a comedy much more than a comedy, full of unpleasant unpredictable moments in which the film also deals with the psychological and innate instinctive behavior of men and women in connection with the sometimes controversial act of sex. I loved this movie, character Jeanne played beautiful Anne Parillaud performs wonderfully on the screen as you share in her fight to create a cinematic artwork.
