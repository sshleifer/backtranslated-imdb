Sean Connery is very good as Big Raisuli, Lord Rif and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure film with Arabs, Germans and USMCs all coming to knots in one place or another. There is also a lot of humor in the interplay of major and minor characters. The story is based on a real incident in which a wealthy Greco-American businessman was kidnapped by Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius replaced Candace Bergen and her two children as kidnapping victims, opening the story to a lot of literary licenses. On the other hand, the film gives Milius the opportunity to recall the viewer of two of the most well-known (though mostly forgotten) political era TR era. Brian Keith says: "Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!"; and John Huston (also good as state state John Hay) asks the Japanese ambassador for a White House dinner, "Do you like knifee, do you like fork?"
