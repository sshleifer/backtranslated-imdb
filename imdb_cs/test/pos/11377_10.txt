This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and excellent writing and directing by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've seen this movie several times and I always enjoy it. It does not age, it is always fun and stimulating. Easily Burt Reynolds the best role, and he does a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also provide an excellent comedy show. There is no weak element in this film.
