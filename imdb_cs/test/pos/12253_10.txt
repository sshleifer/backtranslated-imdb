Television News Producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), a news moderator, and brings them back to her room. Romance, however, is abbreviated when it proves that Tom is, in his own words, "not good at what I am at u," and Jane realizes that she embodies everything she hates where television news goes. The rub comes when Tom tells him he's going to join her intelligence office in Washington. The initial attraction of Jane and Tom is therefore given a second chance, but Jane will be able to postpone her professional opinion to the person she attracts - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's intelligent reporter and confidant. Despite his apparent talent, Aaron's career is stagnating because he lacks the trust and skills of people - and the classic good looks - is a success that becomes his new, less skilled and less intelligent colleague - Tom. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane may fall in love with Tom, despite her better judgment, because it is becoming increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for himself. as part of the trials and trials of a network of TV news agencies where the moral dilemma and ethics are quickly faced and where the performance and dramatic effect are becoming more and more important. Here comes most bites of well-observed comments and scenes. One of the many moments is the scene where Tom meets the top top Anchorman Network, Bill Rorich (a role portrait for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realize a lot about the character of these two men from this quick shot of two hands. The dialogue between characters is one of the most intelligent and intelligent. funny you are ever likely to find anywhere on the movie and in that amount. Brooks gets the best part of them, according to his character, but even the shortest conversations that are random and maybe over-heard by one or more characters as they move in a crowded room should be listened to. The hunter is in this role a tour for which she was rightly (and not herself) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she would probably win if it was a role in the film that is a false part of what happened a closely related industry - and against the strong performance of another actress in a more traditional sense of good, rom-com. Brooks is also excellent as a constantly frustrated and at times too smug-for-his-good-good, Aaron Altman. While Hurt's own appearance and provides the necessary personality of his character, he does not always convince himself that he is quite like a dim-witty character saying he is or should be. It depicts hidden intelligence that allows him to make the most of his obvious limitations that may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt would pull him in. Besides, when he tells us he "stinks" or "doesn't do it," Hurt comes as a little smarter than that. Otherwise it is effective performance, in a role where its character is threatened by its intellectual constraints, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadowed Hurt's performance. It's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who's supposed to say someone else would do it, or it would be better if it was alongside Hunter and Brooks and their performance in this movie. Support is provided, inter alia, by Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for Christian Clemenson's subsequent Boston legal fame, and the shortest bit-parts for Joan's Brother, John Cusack, whose face he is he won't even notice. James L Brooks has provided us with a lot of great TV shows and movies, and this movie should be there with the best of them. She can't win any Oscars, even through seven nominations, but has won a lot of other awards, and has turned Holly Hunter into a star.
