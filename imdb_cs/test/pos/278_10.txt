This is a very moving movie that has a new twist: a relationship that ends. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, who is desperately trying to keep in touch with Bobby for one more day, is extremely convincing and moving and takes you straight to the story. Who wasn't confronted with the end of the relationship and at least wanted to scream tears, "One more night!" When she gives her one more night, the path that these two people share makes you pause and thinks how precious every truly close relationship can be, and how everyone, whether permanent or not, should be treated with respect, rather than with simple ejected.
