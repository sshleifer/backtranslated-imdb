I saw a movie when I was back in high school for a couple of years. I thought it was a movie that provoked the idea that you wanted to look beyond the riddles. I think the type of people who wouldn't like this movie would be the ones who don't like to solve things or those who are frustrated when they can't solve puzzles. his good movie, based on a real story that happened in my home town of Toronto, Ontario. So if u want a real record of things happening in the aisles there, watch this movie. And for those who just watch movies to point to holes and character defects, they realize that this is happening in real life. But that's all I want to say. Puzzles are good, some are hard, some are not. But the film also doesn't want you more, more puzzles, more explanations, just more. Something else I want to add is that there are thoughts in this film, the underground puzzle world, but there is much more. You can't search to find it. Never think of it being impossible to find it. Leave your brand and find you.
