I don't know what it is exactly, but the movie is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me ... Fulci created one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well-unique movies I've ever seen . Not sure what else to say about it, but I love this movie! The tartar steak scene is absolutely terrible and the whole Nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely cheerful ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but someone heard that based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him with "Scream"? "Cat in the Brain" is a must for lovers of bad movies everywhere ... Yes, I'll definitely say it's not a "good" movie, but I guarantee that some scenes will stay in your mind forever! This is a madness exercise, people ... I think if I were a "serious" critic, I would give it 3, but for total joy (again, I can't explain my affection).
