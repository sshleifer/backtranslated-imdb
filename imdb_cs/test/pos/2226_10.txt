I saw this movie in the theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I just left my job in biomedical engineering at the hospital. I consider the scenario to be an exaggeration of the real type of thing that happens in hospitals. The idiots who built it on production value don't get that point and probably never have been hospitalized. And he never worked with certainty in one. Billy Jack (the same era) was very poorly produced, but had a remarkable social commentary and was a very good movie with a real social message. Since then I've been looking for this movie, it's the first page I've found out where it was mentioned.
