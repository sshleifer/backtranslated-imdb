When it was announced that the "King of Pop" was dead at the age of 50, a month before he was about to launch a series of live concerts at the London O2 Arena, it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world. He was and will be forever one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry and he will miss it. I decided to recall how amazing he was by watching what many consider not only Jackson's best video (and perhaps even a song), but John Landis (American Werewolf in London), the biggest music video ever made. The film opens with Michael and his girl (Ola Ray), who has a broken car, and after giving her a ring, the moon rises and turns into a werewolf. Then we will see Michael and his girl watching this horror movie, being scared and leaving, and Michael soon follows her and sings a cult song. Vincent Price's voice will be heard soon, and the zombies will come out of the ground and open the coffins from the graveyard, and Michael and the girl are, of course, surrounded. He turns away and Michael became a zombie himself and with all the other creatures that make a cult dance before returning to his normal self, at least for the choir. The girl runs into a nearby haunted house, blocking the door, but the zombie Michael is still able to break through and screams when he touches her to find out that Michael is saying, "What's the problem?" The film ends when he takes her home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons, and he was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, Thriller was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums and this video was 71 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. It was number 1 on the 100 biggest pop videos. Very good!
