Spoilers: This movie has problems, but eventually gets a message across. I liked it because it ends. A nice guy is trying to break his heart several times, but there's no typical Hollywood ending at the end. They end up as such things always end, or at least they always have in my own and friendly experiences. Anyone who thinks that the end of this is not what is really happening, as it seemed that the first girl believed that the girl would come, realizes that she is going with an asshole who treats her badly because she is concerned about she doesn't care at all for being either naive or living in a more perfect world than me. I give him 7/10, extra points simply because she wasn't afraid to end up on a note down, didn't give any real distinction, only the main character was broken, confused and like so many men from countless generations were before.
