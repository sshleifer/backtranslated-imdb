An adult girl gets a horse of her dreams and is trained by a former jockey to attend the London Grand National Steeplechase. A gentle adaptation of the classic children's book, with Taylor's excellent starting power as an energetic but polite young man. Rooney is fine as her coach, though she has some too melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problems are that they are scaly elements, nothing interesting happens and pulls a little too long. The race is exciting, but it could have been much more.
