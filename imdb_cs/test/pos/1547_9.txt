One of the best "kitchen sinks". A fantastic view of London and invaluable excerpts from working life in the 1960s. Loach's eye seems to catch everything, but he will make no judgment - the taste of things to come. Like "Kes," "Riff-raff," and "Sweet Sixteen," it serves as a film social history for Britain. Carol White is absolutely convincing, you love her, you love her, you want to take care of her, but you keep her head in her self-destructive decisions, and you still follow her in some hopeful hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp, (fresh from "The Collector", also catch "The Hit") and a plethora of English faces (all look very young). Correctly set to Donovan tones. The stamp sings' Yellow's Color ', in a beautiful scene, ending with saying that "Getting Better, Not Me" (the song also used in "The Rules of Attraction" - I Think) Watch Carol Whites Screen Mommy Going' To Go Out And Get Bloke 'putting on her fake eyelashes to sound' Rosie 'on the radio - priceless. A treasure for anyone who was around in the time, and a reminder of how good life is in England. Incidentally, Soderburgh used clips from the film "The poor cow" in "The Limey".
