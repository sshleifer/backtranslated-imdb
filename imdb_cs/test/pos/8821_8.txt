This is "dock-drama" (mostly) later years of KW's life, with almost all parts played by actors (but instead of which the television quarterfather plays alone!). It was made for the BBC4 art channel, but my guess is that it will syndication and DVD release soon. KW playfully plays Michael Sheen, who repeats his previous stage role with great success. Most supportive casts are also very good and a pleasant touch is the recreation of period TV shows with new actors. However, this is not easy to observe - anyone who is familiar with KW journals and general unhappy behavior will already know how he might be twisted in later life - so don't expect 80 minutes of Carry On styled buffoonery, since the emphasis is definitely in this direction negative. . Recommended, but it is tragic-comic.
