Strange Enough, Shorts Like This Get 10. Why? They are cheerful. That's hilarious. Notice a lot of unpredictable humor. Dated and childish toonayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They had to know that cartoons were not just for children. The art in this is likely the best non-Road Runner art from the 1950s Looney Tunes Shorts. It's hard to meet anything better than the art in "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", though nothing like that will be. This probability runs close to 3rd or 2nd place. Shorts like this could result in a rude LT rip-off, such as Tiny Toons Adventures, to try to squeeze out all the old comedies over and over, like how great movies like Scream spawned crap like I know ... Who was released just to squeeze out all the old horrors of Scream, but like Scream, that's great alone. Chuck Jones had his mistakes with shorts once in a while. Take Hopper, for example. Few people like Hopper, but never destroyed LT's reputation, but I'm sure it was his addition to things as such. Bottom line: This isn't as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!" Catch it on Cartoon Network often.
