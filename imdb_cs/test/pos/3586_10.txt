full of surprises, beautiful, cruel at times. as well as life itself. lets one ask for more. the best parts are, of course, action scenes and chases. they must really wonder how much these guys put into the making of some scenes (whale chasing, hunting polar bears, etc.). It's an amazing experience and don't miss anyone who delves, surfes or goes to the beach once in a while. the music is appealing and the narration is excellent and changes very well. Definitely one of the best documentaries ever made, and worthwhile to be invaluable 10 (for its kind). Some shots are very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (each shot of killer whales is cruel).
