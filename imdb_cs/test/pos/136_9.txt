I didn't expect too much for cruel reviews and as a result I enjoyed the movie. The softer colors and less stunning composition of the shots than some of his previous films have in my opinion allowed the story to focus. Although the religious conflict in vampire whipping was commonplace, I felt like many other things were not. For example: how his forces were often revealed by interaction with her. <br /> <br /> Very strong and well-functioning love scenes. The symbolism the man they killed to get closer to each other separates them even more. Their strong differences in what it means to be a "vampire" created by their previous life experiences. the lack of dozens of other vampires who appear or create in the movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read a few things about "tricks used in other movies". Of course. However, I feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene, and I feel that it does well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer to use the tricks that are used correctly and appropriately, which in my opinion is the case with this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend.
