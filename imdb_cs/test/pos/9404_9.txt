I was quite impressed by Martha's narration and how it felt the audience's emotional heart and how it had to influence the family. The forward-backward motion was well done, and I usually don't like movies with flash-back / flash-forward effects. I felt throughout the film's development that "Tommy certainly did". It leaves you feeling how these people lived their lives almost totally without themselves and the consequences of not wanting to answer the question, "It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are?" And then: "What the hell are they doing?" Or "I don't care?" Rich, spoiled brats literally run away with murder. Or did they think .......
