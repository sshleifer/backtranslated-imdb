In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved from production manager at Warner Brothers, tried to get his newly formed company 20th Century Fox on the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the sparkling MGM Palace. "This is my affair" was an attempt at cash on the current success of historical films established at the turn of the century ("San Francisco" "in Old Chicago") and in retrospective succeeded quite powerfully. The story is fascinating. The problem maker, but the heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor), was given the secret task of President McKinley to reveal the ring of bank robbers that cripple US finances. He finds a gang, but falls in love with his female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to decide between love and duty. Not all about this year's movie works fine, but overall it's a good piece of movie making. Kurt Vonnegut's "Mother Night" (Nick Nolte's starring role in the book) seems to be quite believable, at least in the studio's trust. As a fan of old movies, I am always excited when I come across the one I have never seen and "That's my business" was no exception.
