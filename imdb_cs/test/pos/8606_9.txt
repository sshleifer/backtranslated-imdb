Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was released in 1989 only at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film a slow worsening of Hiroshima radiation victims, an added blessing. Black rain in the name refers to a combination of ash, fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and movies about dropping an atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one. Based on the novel Masuji Ibus, which collected information from interviews and diaries of victims of real life bombs, the film captures how the whole family is influenced psychologically and physically by bombing years after the original explosion. It is a terrifying vision that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians attend their daily activities. Suddenly there is a blinding light and a stormy explosion. Almost every building is destroyed or damaged beyond repair. The first atomic bomb that has ever fallen on the city is now part of history. Survivors must somehow recover their lives without knowing the devastating consequences of the bomb. The film is filmed in high contrast black and white, a story centered around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman who is caught in a radioactive rain when her ship heads back to the city to seek friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us the indelible images that remain with us: a young boy with skin hanging from his body begging his brother to recognize him, the older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from a pile of rubble, the mother is in trouble, when the rock blackened the body of his child. When a family returns to their country home, the life of Yassuka will change forever. She sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable bouts of radiation illness that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). The family, who pretends to have only the usual business, denies that the bomb affects Yasuko. "She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. They all forgot about it. They forgot the hell fire and went to the rally as an annual festival. I'm sick of it," says Katayama's friend (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feels shame for being different from the others and guilty of being contaminated. When her aunt and uncle try to find her husband, eligible men refuse to marry her for suspicion of her health, even though Shigematsu has copied his diary to prove that she was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only suitor he feels comfortable with is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of the engine. Ultimately, the beauty of life manifests itself so often when Yasuko goes to the pond and sees the look she has longed for, the king of carp jumping into the water, playfully, as if to say that joy is still over despair. Unfortunately, in the radio statements of politicians about the re-use of the bomb in the Korean War. "Human beings will not learn anything," Shigematsu says. "They smirk. Unfair peace is better than the war of justice. Why can't they see?" Immamura's Black Rain will hopefully allow all of us to see more clearly.
