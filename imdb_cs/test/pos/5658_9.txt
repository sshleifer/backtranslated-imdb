During World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers starve, die, grow weak and become increasingly insane. A small group of soldiers trying to stay alive eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly portrays the madness that overtakes people in extreme conditions. There are few humorous parts in this film, but most of it is just a very slow motion and realistic film. He follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and finally to death. A very interesting film, showing death and horror, about what might have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
