For most of my life, I've been watching this movie quite regularly and never getting old. For all comments and insults (mostly by David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And that's what keeps this movie entertaining after all these years. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of the great Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), the auto parts salesman, and went on to do all his life. But after he died on the wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and is about to buy Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a large spare parts manufacturing company. To save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along with a ride, though not a choice, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is a former classmate of Tommy who was a real Tom. The film goes to chemistry between two stars SNL (and best friends of life) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy to drive the world between them. He's a big, stupid guy versus a smart guy. It works and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. In fact, Farley and Spade are also decent drama actors. Although the film is mainly a comedy, it has a fair share of the drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good as the audience is laughing. Forgive me, but I'm supposed to talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: A Three-Act Biography" for everyone who cares), and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie special for me. Chris Farley was a really good man who fought, and in the end he couldn't conquer his addictions. Although this was the first film he had a leading role in, it is his best film. It really showed who he was and how much he had talent. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, though it doesn't make it less fun. Farley and Spade are closed with a good screen cast. Rob Lowe is suitably slimy like Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is as solid as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is great as a big Tom. Dennehy is easy to believe they are the father of a son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, even though he is smarter and more mature. Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising. Julie Warner is as good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the greatest comedy directors. It keeps the pace fast and energetic, but most importantly, it knows how to make a comedy funny. He doesn't joke and understands that witty actors know what they're doing and he lets them do it. But Segal goes a step further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both pulls the heart (really) and tickles the funnybone. Critics didn't like "Tommy Boy." Shame on them. The film does not have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbade Farley and Spade was forced to do muted comedy la "Office"). It's a great movie and one of my favorite favorites.
