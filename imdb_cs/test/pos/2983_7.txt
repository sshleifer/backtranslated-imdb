I was in my middle age when I saw this movie and was impressed by the beauty of young stars, as well as loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. I am surprised to learn that Alvina has recently died, that Bury has not worked for almost 30 years in the film business, and that they would both be at the age of fifty. Elton John's soundtrack is stunningly beautiful and promotes an atmosphere of sheltered innocence that secluded characters. I saw a movie poster, invoiced it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which seems to mean something like "Two kids who love each other" - English language distributors have sensibly shortened the name! Paul, an ignored 15-year-old son of an English entrepreneur living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they intend to spend a day's holiday at Michelle's late father's country cottage, but in the end there will be a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and has a baby at home. After the baby's birth, the police come to Paul's workplace and take him away. "Blue Lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence protected in isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
