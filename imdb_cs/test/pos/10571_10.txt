I never dreamed when I started watching this DVD that I would be absolutely fascinated by it in a few minutes. The story was immersive and fun. The acting was excellent. The biggest surprise of all was how I would be so enchanted by the love that these two young women radiated across the screen. Their initial physical encounter was by far the finest, romantic, gorgeous, mediocre, fascinating love scene I've ever seen on film. I literally stopped breathing. I couldn't believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex, they told more passion and titration than any American production could ever hope to happen. Bravo to the author, screenwriter, director and cast.
