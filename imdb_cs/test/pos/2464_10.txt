This film is rarely on the rope and I've never seen it before, I think it would be similar to Bruce Willis's "nn America", with the usual American Freedom story, and so on. Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I've never seen him in a movie that I didn't love, even though the script is bad because he's so talented). Kathy Bates is a groundbreaking mom and she does a great job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the biggest movies, but also directed this film. Please stereotype him from the movie "Breakfast Club"; He's much better at it, and I would like him to do more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood movies. The film is realistic when we see Emilio at home from Vietnam, during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is like a nurse who feels she is "disgusted and embarrassed" returning a soldier, her brother; he is quite alienated from the family, and, especially at this time in American history, this story is very relevant. I have learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you will really feel the character; It is not a violent, journalistic depiction, such as a "platoon", but rather a character study that leaves us even more concerned and afraid of the effects of war, especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims. With today's violence, it is rare that a film actually makes one feel sad and casts a tear; it deserves it and deserves credit.
