Everything about "Choose Connor" was the top = drawer, especially the script and very proficient work of 21-year-old director, writer, producer Luke Eberl. . . a talented young man from whom he expects great things. All negotiations were trustworthy, dialogue smart, important topic. Did it !!! I saw him at the Woodstock 2007 Film Festival, where he was screened twice and went through spectators. It's more than just a film about age - this boy learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson on trust, politics, and "system" - how things work to suit the personal agenda of people in strong positions. <br /> <Br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain.
