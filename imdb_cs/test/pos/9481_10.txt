After waiting for the definitive collection of Led Zeppelin perfumes on video, fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the biggest concert video ever! Much better than the unhappy "Song Remains the Same", this video contains performances of no less than 5 different locations that cover decades. It also includes rare interviews and TV shows. The sound quality is amazing with regard to the source material used. And video quality is even more impressive. This is absolutely necessary for all Led Zeppelin fans.
