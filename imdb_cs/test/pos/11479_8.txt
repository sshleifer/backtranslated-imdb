Yesterday I finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie. My conspiracy knowledge was limited to about 60 seconds of a trailer, but I heard some good critics who made my expectations increase. As I saw the movie, those torn pieces were combined with a story that became quite interesting, with some apparently inexplicable details. Eventually, however, everything is published as a simple sequence of bad luck events, "sorte zero" in Portuguese. Above all, I felt that the story makes sense, and everything fits in its place, the characteristics of a good script. I also have to mention the soundtrack that helps create a wonderful environment. And if you recall the resources Fernando Fragata used to make this film, I believe it will mean that many Hollywood producers will be envious ...
