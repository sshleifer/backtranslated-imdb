For Estoninans, Finland sometimes appears as a country of dreams. A country where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies did this brilliant piece that shows that Finland is not all that good. That Finland can be as much as Paha maa (The Bad Land) than any other country. This shows that people there can be as unhappy in their lives as we do anywhere else. Sometimes that is not good. This film shows pretty well why Finland is one of the best suicide countries. Living in the North is not easy. The cold climate is changing us. I became increasingly attracted to Finnish films and this is very good. Playing is also great. Jasper Pääkkönnen became one of the finest stars in Finland. Watch out for the sex scene (if you have little kids) and a little depression that could come after the movie! 8/10
