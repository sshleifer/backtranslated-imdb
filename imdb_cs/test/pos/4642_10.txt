It's a fun movie for a movie that was PG. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I don't know how the audience would react today, but if you grew up on it or loved the 1980s, it's a great movie. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, who in my opinion is one of the best characters in the film. Paul Ruebens will also appear for about 10 minutes. I like nostalgia.
