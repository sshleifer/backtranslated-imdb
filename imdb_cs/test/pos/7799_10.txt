Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the five best intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood, maybe even in Hollywood. When the movie came out, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a flop, but I never understood why it was a flop ... but let me say one thing ... this movie should more money by selling home cassettes and DVDs and by showing up in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This film has been shown many times in the movie channels, and I think that now, public love and television producers are constantly repeating the film. I personally watched the film more than 80 - 100 times and still love it ..... <br /> <br /> Aamir Khan as Amar and Salman Khan as Prem is blowing the mind, but especially liked the performance of Aamir Khan as a streetman smart guy .... his dialogues in the movie are cheerful ... the story is simple and heres how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy boys and come from a poor family Tailors and Father Amars is a barber. They both get the message that Millionaire's daughter from London is coming to India to find a suitable match ... both Amar and Prem think it's a great opportunity to become a super rich ... so that's why you both go to Raveen Tandon. Millionaires' daughter ... ... both hate each other on their way and each of them tries to deceive others to marry Ravenen ..... the comedy scenes in between are so happy that you need a glass of water to stop stomach pain with laughter ....... and then there's Raveenas Uncle (Millionaire's look like brother) Teja, who wants to avenge Raveenas's father ..... since he is broke and Raveenas's father is a millionaire .. .... his plans include Ravenen's abduction to blackmail Raveenas's father, for whom he hires 2 butlers ..... <br /> <br /> but later we know it's in the movie (check out the movie you know ) ....... then there is Shakti Kapoor as a master of Gogo crime who is also incredibly fu NY .. Things that interested me were dialogues in a movie that became a legend of its kind ... Aamir khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes as "OOima". ....... and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain on Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi on Gogo Aa Jaega" ...... every scene is so funny ...... < I really liked the one in which Aamir Khan and Salman Goto get from Teja to Raveena and both go to Luna with "chillar" money in a bag. the scene is so funny .. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ..... this is one movie that I would recommend to have a DVD and never regret. ......
