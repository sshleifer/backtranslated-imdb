Of the 24 best lesbian movies in my library, I have to rate this film as the number one film of all time. This film will go into history as the best in its genre. It is a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from wealth to rags and from rags to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) appearing in her life. It is built on a Victorian background in 1890, making it an ideal setting for some of the industry's best entertainment. This film saved no cost for music and costumes and makeup Rachael and Keeley wore, while on stage in the halls just added to the diversity of the film. No matter what kind of movies you like, I can guarantee that this movie will not only amaze you, but will continue to keep your attention through all three episodes. This movie will be played and enjoyed for decades. An unrated DVD collector is a must for every user's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice to cast in these two roles and played them very well.
