Before you look at this movie - clean your ears, put your makeup off your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. He doesn't. This image gives you enough heat to keep your relationship long enough. If you are a Jew / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, what a popular movie-minority so sometimes - laugh in your memories. If you are something else or what are yours as well - laugh at the bittersweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. This movie, nothing seems strange, as it sometimes seems weird. However, I fear that this film will see little, because it is not the type of people watching movies. But please do it for humanity and don't forget to buy a soundtrack for joy.
