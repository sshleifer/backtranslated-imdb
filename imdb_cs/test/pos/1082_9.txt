It seems to be given, but if the viewer forgets the context, he risks missing the enjoyment opportunity. It is easy carp, from the noble heights of the 21st century, in style and prizes the Great Years of Depression; but an intelligent viewer will be this magical word, "context", and better understand, and so enjoy "accident happens". Among the actors, Ronald Reagan once again proved to be a good-looking and playful man and did a good job again. The reviewer said earlier that Gloria Blondell was playing an ugly wife, but that was bad: She plays a clerk clerk who has a crush on Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but keeps her hands away while he's married. Gloria was cute. Not as fresh as her sister Joan, she was still an attractive and good actress. Maybe her looking somewhat like Joan was at the expense of a more successful career and it's definitely our loss. Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg and played well. Other actors included Dick Purcell and Big Earl Dwire were supposed to play something beside the cowboy villain. Again, most players have never reached the "home name" status, many deserve it, but Gosh has given a good performance in a story that is still up to date.
