I was a bit afraid of actors and acting in Italy, then "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo. It was a long time since I had seen such a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino has written an amazing story of loneliness and Tony has built one of the most memorable characters to see in movies in recent years. The film is not perfect, but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you long after the film's vision. Toni, please continue to play in movies, you are certainly the most amazing actor today (not only in Italy, his performance deserves international acclamation). I rate this movie 9/10.
