Before this clip, music clips were for artist's viewing only. Michael Thriller "Thriller" has created a whole new section of music videos that can be honestly called mini movies. "Thriller" follows a couple as they travel to the girls' house from the movie. On the way they meet zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies plunge into a couple and the girl turns around to see that Michael has turned into one of them. Then they do a little dance. The scariest thing about "Thriller" may be the fact that it is becoming more fun and fun than many movies that are made. After twenty years, the first music video will remain. <br /> <br /> P.S. My Music Video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Child of Mine"
