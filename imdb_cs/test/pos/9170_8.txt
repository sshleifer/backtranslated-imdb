I must admit that I liked this film much more than I expected. Will Smith have that clean charm that just can't help you. The storyline was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma". This boy Kevin James has a real sense of comic timing and physical comedy. I've never seen his TV show, but he was very well cast in this movie. Amber Valletta was pretty good. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if she were to be an actress or model, the cast could leave something that would be desirable. I liked Julie Ann Emery and wished she had a bigger part. But Eva Mendes saved the best for the last. Her beauty and magic, like the right amount of inactivity, snapped me to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more in the future. This film is definitely worth checking.
