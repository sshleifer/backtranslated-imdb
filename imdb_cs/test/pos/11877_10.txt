I am a big fan of Larkin's works, I believe he was in the midst of the greatest poets of the 20th century. The film itself will do great justice to bard Hull. Beautifully depicted by all players in their roles. Bonneville does service for sexually repressed Larkin, he avoids the impression and wanders from becoming a cartoon. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the work itself. Rather than relying on the massive intensity with which Larkin felt, using his words alone gives a better view of the storyline and adds a much more stunning but more fascinating atmosphere. Most enjoyable.
