I was looking for movies from Germany in a TV guide, and I found one named The Bunnyguards so I followed him and I laughed. I wanted a DVD, but its not available here (I could order it from Germany, but it doesn't have subtitles) It was played again, so I recorded it and watched from time to time. Anyway, I was looking for information and found that his real name was Erkan & Stefan, but I know it by the Australian name: The Bunnyguards. Some people I know from Germany don't like Erkan & Stefan Because of their accents, but not the Germans, I didn't notice anything. Jokes are good, but some Germans might find their off-putting accents. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all extras (with a disc with 2 discs with only subtitle features would be wrong) I would buy it in an instant! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a laugh and a pretty good story.
