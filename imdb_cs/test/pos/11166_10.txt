Great movie about great man. Thomas Kretschmann is the first, as in all other films. I would never imagine him as Pope John Paul. She speaks loudly to the casting director. Why do they hold him as German film officers? And did he notice universal attention to the "pianist"? Of course, the uniforms look so hot. I know a lot of girls who are full of his pretty face. But this guy is a great actor and has so much potential. If you don't believe me, go see Stalingrad. I hope that in the future he will get a lot of excellent roles with more diversity. Otherwise, it is a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
