Having just seen five show episodes before it, (I watched a repeat on BBC Two) I really had a lot of League experience, but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of the British comedy, I can say that this movie is hilarious. When he saw Mr. Lipp, (which I didn't see on the screen before the movie), Briss and Geoff were a great comedy experience on the big screen. Being on the screen is something the League uses to the full, with heads blowing up (it comes as a surprise to who it is) and terrible murders with a random style of medieval battles in style. Geoff is perhaps the funniest character of the film's three protagonists, because it has the best inserts and overall behavior, just like in the show. One of my only disappointments with the movie did not hear Geoff shout "Well now I have this gun" even once, (although there is a build-up on it in one part of the movie.) The film itself is, use the phrase everyone else, Pythonesque and is it very reminiscent of movies like "Life of Brian." Looks from Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but Papa Lazarou's "Hello Daves" line tore me more than anything they told them (Lazarou is probably my favorite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward). The character was killed and I can only hope that this is not the last league on the screen of Vasey Enterprise. Gatiss mentioned the possibility of another series or movie, I'm very excited now. This is a movie I will see again, partly because the projector died at the end, missed 10 minutes of the movie, but mainly because it's resourceful and cheerful. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as a TV series because I loved it. One thing, however, if you have never seen the League, you will still love, but Dave knows what you think of the people who do it. Tubbs or Edward could give it, it's a local movie, for local people, and a rare thing about it. <br /> <br /> **** outside ***** (4/5)
