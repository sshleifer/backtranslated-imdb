I really liked this movie, although this movie seems so hated and I think it's even better than a deer hunter who has been overrated. Both this film and the Year of the Dragon are very underestimated, even though I saw why this movie wouldn't like anyone. In three and a half hours the film goes too long and the other half of the film is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting Isabelle Huppert, but she can't decide who she is with. Sam Waterston is a villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed and who says they are anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and young Mickey Rourke.
