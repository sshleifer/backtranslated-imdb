I agree with "johnlewis" who said there was a lot going on between the lines in this movie. I think the complexity of the relationships between characters is fascinating, although I think the stimulation of this film might improve. Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre is about to marry his cousin, though his love for her looks like a cousin? Pierre and his stepmother are rather ... curious. It seems that Pierre, Lucy and Thibault have a triangular relationship and the real points to the triangle are not quite sure ... \ t And Isabelle, who is he? Overall, I think it was worth the time. Interesting movie and the one that makes me read Melville.
