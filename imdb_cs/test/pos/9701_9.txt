I was a big fan of Cka, Jackass and Viva La Bam for a long time. They had a great run and expected my laughter to end. But it is not yet. This film opened my mouth all the time. Still laughing, randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations, I think it won't be better than the first. Oh, how incredibly bad I was. There were many great moments in the movie. If you're disgusting, don't like the randomly placed raw humor, or if you don't like the first movie, you might not like it. But with what I said, I almost wet my pants from laughing so hard. She had all sorts of different jokes, masochistic humor, toilet humor, banging, laughter, some big crashes and massive damage to the entire cast. Ryan Dunn even tagged the back tag Bam as a picture that will stay there for a long time. I'm sure you can imagine how this film is raw. No pain, no profit? Right? This movie has already done well, forcing theaters across America to laugh so they will want it to take longer. I know I did it. This movie did not feel short, at all, especially with credits continuing footage. But I still wish she could go on forever. Wait and see when Jackass issue 3! Overall, an excellent movie if you can get through male nudity and some naughty pictures. Keep your kids out of this movie. They don't have to see it, at least until they're older. Support the crew and BUY when they appear on DVD! I know I'll do it.
