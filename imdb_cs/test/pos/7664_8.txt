I like Thackeray's novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is B, casting Loy, in her first role, is somewhat fascinating. and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's follow-up film for EMMA, in which she played an eager and greedy daughter who almost destroys a loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). Loy's Becky is much rougher than Miriam Hopkins's version 3 a year later in BECKY SHARP. Loy's Becky is a very pre-coded film character with her throwing necklines and amoral ways. It is a type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow has easily played, but Becky should be the one to be gentle. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic. In counterpoint to Loy grabbing Becky's good good Amelia (Barbara Kent), who just isn't interesting in character. Mary Forbes is ice-cold as Mrs. Sedley. Most other actors in this version are pretty bla: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian's unpredictability: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as a Marquis; Lilyan Irene as a Polly maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as a housekeeper. Loy is in the front and in the middle. While the end is somewhat shocking, it has a few great scenes, such as the casino gambling scene, where it tries to steal another female winning roulette. The more Loy Becky morally descends, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally "caught". The bottom line is that it's a very solid Loy performance in a movie that should be seen.
