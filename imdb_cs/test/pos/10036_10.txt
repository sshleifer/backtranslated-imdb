Now it's more like one of the best movies I've ever seen, and despite the fact that it was doing very well in all aspects, this film was postponed only because it wasn't very historically accurate. that have been forgiven for not being historically accurate, and many of them have not come too close to being spectacular, fun, and charming. This film is a genre and all naysayers are those with anti-Flynn syndrome. This conservative root syndrome is very closely related to anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton, anti-Kennedy syndromes, usually caused by the fear of charming individuals who have Unconventional Beliefs.If the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art, you will find this film not only one of the best classics, but also one of the best movies of all time.I speed it the second best western in history, right b ehind wayne is The Cowboys ........
