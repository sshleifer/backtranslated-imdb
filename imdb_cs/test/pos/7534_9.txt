The stunning and thoughtful observation of modern life for young people in Japan, such as sand grains, is immersed in issues such as rape, homosexuality and puberty anxiety in a gentle and meaningful way. It provides insight into a youth culture that seeks to define itself beyond the boundaries of its parents' generation, with strict compliance and facade. Typical for a Japanese cinema, often not being said, is more important than what is, so for those who are not adept at Japanese film and culture, beware. It may seem boring and minimalist (as well as any movie that came out of the Japanese bar Mangas) if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and what originally caused my interest in Japan is culture and language. Since I am 22 now and I have learned Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, there's no need to say it's a strong movie. Enjoy!
