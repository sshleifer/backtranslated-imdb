Four unhappy women leave the gloomy London to spend ENRANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy. Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes to life in this charming little film that beautifully demonstrates the merits of a literary script and a set of acting. All elements come together to create a film that, though almost forgotten, still gives rise to a sense of appreciation in the appropriate story resolution. <br /> <br /> The actresses will each master beautifully. Ann Harding is a single woman longing for "wisteria and tranquility" far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays a quiet housewife who wants elegant responsibility to act as a castle hostess. Jane Baxter is a beautiful young noblewoman who has temporarily escaped from her crowd of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene he is in, like an old lady who wants to be alone with her memories of the past. The men in the story are also well occupied. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a somewhat complicated role as a miserable researcher who has a worrying change of personality when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as Miss Alexander's wife, is amazingly pompous as a well-equipped man for England (his hilarious attempt at an English bath in an Italian bath is even more fun with the help of Charles Judels and Rafael Ottian, because the castle is being persecuted by servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is joyfully eccentric as a lady owner. Movie mavens will recognize unrecognized Ethel Griffies playing Hampstead Housewives Club owner.
