He hates Heather Graham because he's beautiful, hates her because it's fun to watch in this movie. Like hipster and funky environments, the actors work together in this movie. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up the screen. Smaller characters - Goran Visnjic (sigh) and Patricia Velazquez are like TALENTED because they are beautiful. Congratulations to Miramax and director Lisa Krueger!
