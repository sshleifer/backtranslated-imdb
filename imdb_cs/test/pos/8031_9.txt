There is an unmistakable print of American C.I.A. can be found in many confused clutter they have left behind. Their goals were initially simple: spy, remove enemy, steal classified information, and destabilize adverse governments. Years have passed and although their mission remains similar, their secret black operations now include domestic espionage, discredit US citizens, and penetrate US organizations that criticize the US government. But this film focuses on the world hunt for C.I.A for the infamous 'Carlos, Jackel.' The film is called "Task" and tells the story of Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn), an American naval officer who has a remarkable resemblance to the master of so many terrorist bombings. Recruiting Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent of the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to look, imagine, break into the elusive organization and then discredit the real Jackel who works for the Russians. This film is explosively exciting and full of wild chases, killing and burying in the country. Quinn is an amazing and surprisingly artistic game playing both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
