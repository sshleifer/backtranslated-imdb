These melodies are the best aspect of this television movie, which, although better than average production values, is a very shallow and slightly altered resume. Dramatizing Richard's discovery of "We Only Only Begun" and Karen's Marriage Problems Admirably ("Superstar" was a nice touch), but remarkably abandons disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Pelus' guitar solos, etc. tomboyish and gutsier party real personality Carpenter. Anderson is in good shape as a creative and rechargeable Richard, and Fletcher is her mark as a loving but nonchalant Agnes. The most challenging moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of the commercial display of anorexia hotline.
