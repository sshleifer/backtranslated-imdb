There are many positive reviews on Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this unique film. Bonnie Hunt has proven to be not only an exceptional actress, but also an amazing director and screenwriter. This film has everything and is full of humanity, tenderness, sense of humor ... Don't miss it, don't wait any longer. And when it comes to bad reviews, don't pay attention. Some viewers forget that this type of movies must be watched by your heart, not just your eyes. If some viewers prefer Notting Hill or have Mail, it's their fault. Returning to me is a real jewel for me, an unforgettable film.
