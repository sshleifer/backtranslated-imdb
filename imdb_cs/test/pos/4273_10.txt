I like TV competition. I hate to see it. There are so many talented competitors. It is a pity that only 2 will be selected. Sometimes they are just as entertaining as competitors. I watched the show faithfully every Sunday night. Don't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show ever on television. Good luck to all competitors, even though I chose two that I would like to see on Danway and Sandy on Broadway. I'm trying to see if my decisions are right. I'm not aware of how long the competition will run until Danny and Sandy are selected, but I will follow until the end.
