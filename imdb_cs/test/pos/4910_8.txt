The story of a widowed father (Claude Rains) educates her four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is beloved by the great hungry Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is a romanced old but rich man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is romantic. Dead dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), his father's business companion, comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. John Garfield, a cynical Mickey (John Garfield), is a very entertaining movie and was nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully director Michael Curitz, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially Lynn). It was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. It was so popular that there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is a stunning, fun, big budget soap opera - well worth seeing.
