There are several aspects of Park's movies, and especially Wallace & Gromit, which I would say to be so great. The first is the subtlety and observation whose flagship is the character of Gromitus. He won't say no noise, all he has is his eyes, eyebrows and posture. With this expression, the park can give us everything we need. Comedies and emotions are transmitted through the finest movements and work great. <br /> <br /> If you're watching a movie, you need to be aware of the full screen. Under normal circumstances, you will be led to movies in the movies, the screen will not be too crowded, there will not be many things that will turn your eyes away from the main guide or action. Park seems to need his films to look the opposite. Throws more content to your audience, it's action in the background, on the side of the screen, even off the screen, and there's always something in the foreground to grab an eye. His films are about multiple viewing and discovery, they are layered with jokes and help actions. <br /> <br /> During this movie, layers of things happening on the screen, foreground jokes on the jar label, and shadows that make action on the screen. You can imagine that films for Park have always been an event, and the movies he loves are the ones he wants to watch over and over again. This is what he shows in his films and through his beloved characters. Then there are the bizarre and crazy inventions Wallace does, something that is reflected in the plot and the twists of the plot, everything is bizarre and out of the wall, but it seems to be perfectly normal in this world . You can imagine Wallace's mind inside the park. <br /> <br /> There's one more thing that makes these movies so unique, that is, modeling and precise hand animation. I must admit that I was concerned when I knew that Dreamworks was involved in the creation of this film, and I thought they would bring their computer animation experiences to the forefront. What I was afraid was that Wallace & Gromit became CGI entities, or in the smallest CGI that was used to clean up the feeling that modeling brought film. It's not like that. You can still see the fingerprints and tools on the characters and far from the distraction of the movie, it just adds so much real feeling and feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on the screen. So what about the movie? Well, I have to say that the conspiracy plot was something I was thinking about before the movie was in the movies, and it didn't come as a surprise, but it didn't affect me a little. In fact, watching how the spinning and the comic timing of the discovery and reaction were all that bothered me as if it were a thriller, but I still laughed. Watching the movie was fascinating in different ways. To see the animation completed, how wild are inventions, how does Wallace get in trouble and Gromit get him out where there are all cross references in the movie, and where are all the jokes! I have to admit that after talking to friends, I couldn't believe how much I missed. <br /> <br /> In this movie is different than with others, here's a new level of humor for adults and I don't mean rough jokes (although there are a couple who are just so British you can't help laughing), I mean jokes that just fly over the kids head, but slap adults in the face. The ones you're used to are somewhere like Pixar. It just adds even more appeal to the movie. However, let me try to be a bit negative here. I haven't noticed voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to actors and see if you know them? Well, I was too wrapped up in film to take care of, or noticed who it was ... well, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main storyline was not as strong and dazzling as I expected, and I found myself in the side stories and characters themselves ... again ... this is not a bad thing, the movie was so much fun. Honestly, I can't think of the bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is pretty repetitive ... until the final title ! Indeed, that's the worst thing I can say. The story is a lot of fun, well set, well written, well done. There's a lot of fantastic characters, not just Wallace & Gromit. There are so many links on the screen, so many links and jokes (check out Lady Tottingham's dress), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are super absorbing and you'll find that you took them before you realize it. There's just so much for you in this movie. There's so much I can say and write about, but I know it's going to change quickly for Park and Aardman, which would also turn into a series of "this piece was really funny" and " there is a little when ... ", and what I'd rather do is say it's a great movie, go see it and relive the whole thing for yourself. But I will say that the bunnies are excellent!
