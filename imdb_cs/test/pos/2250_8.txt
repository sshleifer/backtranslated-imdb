Let's start with Liev's respect for me when I saw his directorial debut "Everything Is Illuminated". Anyone who has read the book knows how saturated the story is with the absurd and merry Alex vocabulary, along with the myriad of flashbacks and insane dream sequences. Liev took it all and worked. The film itself is great - the soundtrack, the show, the cinematography - it all works. There are a lot of stories missing about the city and its inhabitants, but you can do so much with India, so it didn't bother me too much. It is only a disappointment that this film will not be seen by many people, nor does it know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it. I didn't even know it was in theaters. I didn't know when the DVD came out. Do you think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would at least publish an advertisement for him. I had to see the trailer on my DVD "Paradise Now" (released on DVD in the spring of '06) to know that it has "Fall of 2005" release date. Haha - really sad. Anyway, if you come across this review in some way, because one of your friends has read the book and loved it or seen the movie and recommends you see it - take my advice and watch it. It's a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
