The adaptation of director Jay Craven Howard Frank Mosher "Where the River Spins to the North" is one of the finer transitions from literature to screen. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also directed 'The Stranger in the Kingdom'. The cast is excellent - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn offers the best that can be his career - Noel Lord, a wildly independent former lumberjack who is at the heart of this story. The painting The Tattoo of Cardinal Lord's Living Housekeeper / Wife of Common Law is also dead. I am impressed and disappointed that neither of them was nominated for Oscars when this film was released. Performance of this caliber should be confirmed. The only character that's hard to swallow for me is a powerful power company, played by Michael J. Fox. He just looks like a child in this role. I think it's a curse associated with a youthful appearance, no matter how many people wish it. Craven did a great job here by bringing the Vermont figure from the early 20th century to the screen - places, angles, sets, all combining to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. Cinematographer Paul Ryan was exceptional. Also, the Horseflies score is also first-rate - perfectly suited to the mood and scenery. And the story itself? One of the most compelling portraits of the wild independent American pioneering spirit - a feature that is nowadays in the world. When it appears in modern times, the person is often looked upon with suspicion and contempt. In Noel's Lord, we have a character that we can admire for his values, even for his stubbornness. It is not a stiff "period piece", but a vivid look at the era that is gone. , and the type of character that has all but disappeared. These are not gilded heroes, but real people who have strengths and weaknesses. they fight in a harsh environment to live their lives while being at peace with the world they live in. Like today, there are those who have the power that otherwise would have.
