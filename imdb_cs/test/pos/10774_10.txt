This movie is absolutely stunning. He can be provocative, witty, tragic and cinematic, yet claustrophobic. Although flashbacks are unnecessary, the film retains a calm, scary shot and performances are excellent, especially Alec Baldwin, and the fascinating Eric Bogosian as the anti-hero of Barry Champlain.
