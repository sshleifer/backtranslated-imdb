It's definitely not a great show, but better than most other sitcoms. This reminds of shows like Married With Children and Roseanne because they go to places that are not traditionally dealt with in a sitcom. Sometimes it's funny, even if you ignore the tracks of laughter, but not rip-roaring cheerful. Some characters are pretty funny (gay friend) and some of the other drop-ins. This is also one of the few exhibitions where soliloquy characters (sorry for tortured spelling) are actually effective and funny. Is it a All in the Family or Seinfeld show? Definitely not. However, it's definitely better than a show like 'Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of any type at the moment). Oh and Mom is not very bad looking and Hilary's character is a little cat.
