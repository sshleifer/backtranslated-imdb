Actually, I have more questions than commentary. I loved Z-Boys and The Lords of Dogtown. First he saw Lords, then doc, and while I loved the story, I wonder why Sid was an important character in the movie, but he wasn't part of the team and just mentioned a child they knew. Does anyone know about the story? The story of these boys was amazing. I've never experienced skateboarding where I grew up, but my kids enjoyed it. What I've seen in local skate parks is what these boys invented. I never knew. When the film showed competition and the Z-Boys did their thing, they took the rest of the competition.
