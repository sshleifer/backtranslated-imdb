Since I first met the divine Mrs Merkerson as a sex therapist at Spike Lee's "She's got to have it" I was sold to the extent of this extremely gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received Emmy for her portrayal here and saying it is well deserved to be a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here it simply shines as a leader and hand in its community. That was especially annoying to me because I grew up at the same time. The detail of the production was phenomenal and evoked by wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times in the 50s and 60s and women like Mrs. Merkerson. She was thoroughly and aggressively accompanied by a hot, hot cast with performances that one could enjoy again and again. First I saw the name of Macy Gray in credits and went ho-hum. Her performance was so good, and I didn't even recognize her for a third of the way. I am particularly proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to create the feeling and look of another beautiful era in African American culture that is very tastefully done. Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial structure of the time, but infinitely more tuned to the wealth of characters and emotional diversity they provide to show that the final analysis is a decision that we do and to what extent we take responsibility for these choices. It is a good, elegant presentation of African-American life and is probably destined to become a classic. You owe it to you as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
