David Lynch's 9th feature film Mulholland Drive is a deeply moving story of betrayal and jealousy. If anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Each frame of this film has a meaning while referring to other parts and to itself. Nothing is what seems to be the first and you will remain with a real riddle when you try to put the pieces together. It is a film that does not threaten, nor does it manage to fully cope with the demanding form and language of the camera as it might have been with the Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although you clearly recognize classic Lynx motifs and equipment, the film remains highly original, even in the light of Lynch's film. The Lost Highway meant a new way of telling the story; created an unconventional way to set emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch managed not only to control this technique, but to bring it to a new level that makes it much more complex and more dimensional. In this way it creates a framework of different layers in time and the human mind. At a press conference at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, David Lynch said the pursuit of excellence at best could yield a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about synergies like this becomes highly relevant to Mulholland Dr., where different sequences and many details contribute to the total; Dreamscapes and parallels blend together to create a story. In some art, beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors create and creates the worlds that Lynch creates, as complex as the real world. In my opinion, she is never forced, for example, by Memento, using an original way of communicating with the audience. Next, I compare Mulholland Drive with other films, I think it proves David Lynch as the master of what he does and overcomes art and filmmaking in ways no one has ever done. Compared to, for example, Alejandro Jodorowski or current Matthew Barney, I think Lynch is no more able to let the artist rule the filmmaker, or rather David Lynch understands and implements filmmaking as an art form. Understanding conspiracy is not a small feat, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. Lynchian cinema is often, and definitely in Mulholland Drive, an increase in human emotions. Working with emotions is a fine craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch says, "A little too much, and emotions disappear. A little too little, and that won't happen." David Lynch has no problem with this balance in Mulholland Drive. Lynch's portraits cover all kinds of dimensions and do different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a subconscious journey. It is a true and naked film with undeniable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what moved it to the pinnacle of cinematography. The Ultimate Movie.
