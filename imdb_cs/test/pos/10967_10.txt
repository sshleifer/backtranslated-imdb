John Cassavette decided as his first film, apparently as a single shot in New York to not have a dialogue script, and will provide the equivalent of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm of 1959 - all actors know what to do and say They have the right look in their eyes when they talk. In other words, it is one of the most realistic views of the generation of beats, sweetly embedded in it, and telling the story of racial tension. A group of black siblings is in focus, one is trying to get better concerts than the average strip-club and has a sister who is much lighter than him, who, in a relationship with a white man, connects with a white man. it breaks both sides. However, the film is not just about it; Cassavettes likes when his characters roam around New York (which wasn't many films in 1959/1960) and his narrative style is similar to that of improvisational jazz artists today. Dated, sure, but it's worth a look at movie enthusiasts; Martin Scorsese described it as one of his most difficult influences.
