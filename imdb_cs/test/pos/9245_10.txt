Nice Doco Stuie! Although it didn't work out as you wanted with the original movie, you have a fantastic piece of work and great tracking. This also applies to everyone else. It's great to see warts and all the process information without being "too nice". <br /> <br /> He loved it! Worth seeing. Que Pena, the writer of the 'original' film, could not appreciate what you achieved. Love this attitude. Great piece. We look forward to further work. <br /> <br /> Keep the gate! Paully
