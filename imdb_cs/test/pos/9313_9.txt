How is bear paw, elephant trunk or monkey brain for dinner? Let Tsui Hark give you in this wonderful and cheerful comedy about the art of cooking traditional (?) Chinese way. This film shares the common structure of American sports film, but instead focuses on baseball, focusing on cooking, which is all the more interesting. I even think Leslie Cheung's character looks a lot like Charlie Sheen in Major League ... This movie also includes a little Zhao Wen Zhao vs Xiong Xin Xin fighting (love to see more than that after The Blade) and a pretty funny joke about Leon Lai ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not the ideal movie for a strict veggie.
