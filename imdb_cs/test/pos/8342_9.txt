Dan Burgess is a nice guy. He's a Christian. Dan can't get to the girl and think all his friends have fun. They keep constantly harassing him and making fun of him. Dan prays one night and wishes he would never be a believer in Jesus. for one day. Things get hairy out there. The angel appears to Dan and explains that his prayer is granted. So all the effects Dan had on starting a Christian club. He was friends of Scot Parks and making a difference is erased for one day. Dan's eyes are open. His life really made a difference.
