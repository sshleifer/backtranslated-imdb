This is undoubtedly one of the most successful debut films for every director. The film is only 90 minutes long, but it can tell everything about life and death. There is not much action and dialogue is minimal, but the film goes perfectly and requires your attention thanks to the wonderfully natural feeling of everything that happens. Leadership performances are perfection, and even some supportive characters have strong emotional scenes. The film will be somewhat lost in today's modern audience, but this is the one everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this one is perfect!
