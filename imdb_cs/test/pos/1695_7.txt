"Landscape after the battle" opens with the escape of prisoners through a snow-covered field of fences - rather humorous movements accompanied by the Vivaldis Four Seasons. Touching hole. Soon, however, we will soon learn to know these prisoners as a crowd, and when they (also treating the humorist) bury a man alive, the protagonist pauses for a moment, but soon engages in finding books from the campsite rather than caring for his neighbor. . The rest of the film takes place in an American camp where the prisoners are not released, in a semi-empty semifinal. The perfect set for studying war crime, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, grief and human misery in general. The film is an important move. In coming women, and with them the film changes light, color and mood. At the same time, it appears that these prisoners were slaves in the Holocaust. I think that the main basic political theme of the film must be the human treatment of Jews under and after World War II, not just Nazi extermination, but humanity that left them to happen - and even force them out of Europe after the war. At the emotional level, the film about grief and the problem of letting go of sadness, how the environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. But the film is a carpet of basic contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. Several times during the film, a Gypsy prisoner plays a harp, an emotional melody, a brutally rejected (film) protagonist. This example takes on the important essence of the film's style and theme. As for his very comic humor, as the protagonist loses and finds back his glasses, in the crowds, in heaps of hay, etc. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when you see this movie. Great light handling can be compared to Spielberg's best. Intermezzo Grunwald speaks for himself. It was just a movie from the camp, but it filmically brings the film into a dream and eternity with deep beauty. Anyway, there is another scene I can't let go without comment. His Christian dinner. Undoubtedly ironic, but deeply religious, we see a transsubstantial moment, all falling to the knees, while the protagonist is saved from being isolated by the priest to serve as a comic altar. His bells mock the scene, but they also give her emotions and love. When Nina gets her bread, sunlight and spherical bells fall on her, the ultimate moment of the film. <br /> <br /> The main players are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as a perfect protagonist of the Wajda - a doubting discouraging mind, unable to put into life all aspects of his mind and emotions. Beautiful Celinska is with a big body that debuts in a character who is unable to express all her inner proud movements. Those who try to describe everything are often unable to consider anything. That is Wajda. His films are either very moving, deep or beautifully filmed, but they pay attention to the specificity of life and society. The moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of grief for the third, the moment of nothing for the fourth. There are at least two reasons why you need to pay attention to Wajdas movies of this period. First, it is a remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow Communism twenty years later. The second is the development of the film and narrative language that Kusturica has magnified.
