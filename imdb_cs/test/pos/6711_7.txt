LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel Cosmic Vampires, which ignores most of the novel concepts and structures (in fact, the QUATERMASS series owes more than the novel), but the scenes it leaves from the novel are almost identical to those in the film. And talking about the script must be one of the most uneven in cinema history, though it was written in the chapters of several different people. Take Carlson, for example, disappear after the shuttle's morning scenes, which led me to believe he was dead, and then reappears in the middle of the film to explain the conspiracy to the devoted British and the lack of attention of the screenwriters. who spoils the film. And there are plenty of other clumsy scenarios, such as heroes returning to London in a helicopter, and they don't realize it was a zombie run until they fly over it. <br /> <br /> I could go a long way about these holes, but LIFEFORCE is actually nice to watch if you don't use your brain. It's good to see a sci-fi horror movie from the time the aliens were portrayed as cute creatures that the kids hid in their dorms to keep them from being grown up by nasty adults. Special effects and pyrotechnics are very good, there are lots of actions and stunts, and LIFEFORCE has one of the most memorable aliens in the form of a space girl. When he mentioned LIFEFORCE in an interview with men, it's always a race to say "saw a stranger in LIFEFORCE? She can suck lifeforce out of me at any time" Hardly surprising when looking at the demographics of the voices that this film is more popular with men than females <br / > <br /> "Don't worry. Naked girl can't escape from here" Can't she? Skoda <br /> <br />
