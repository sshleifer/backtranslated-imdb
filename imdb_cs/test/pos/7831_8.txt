Ladies and gentlemen, we really have become the winner here. Actually, we won't do it, but the boy is often a hilarious and always funny horrible horrible stinker. Poor Alma (gripping Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes deadly venomous snakes to grow inside her body. Alma and her upset shamanic husband Brujo (Alby Castro, who feverishly overcomes the delicious intensity of sight) on a train heading to Los Angeles. Naturally, a bunch of deadly vipers lose, so they can terrorize a diverse range of passengers. The Mallachi brothers, working on the absurd scenario of Eric Fosberg, treat the absurd assumption straight, creating a wonderfully pathetic piece of delicate cheese. Crunchy CGI effects, a pathetically erratic common variety of Gardner's snakes (to the soundtrack were the sounds of haunted rattles to imprint them in the weak sense of otherwise non-existent threats), to a rapid pace, to a complete lack of any tension or momentum, an apparent torn equestrian kit, just simply stunning "you gotta be kidding me!" The over-the-top pointless ending are all downright amazing in their very jaw-declining horrible. Better yet, we also have a game (if lame) playing out of the no-name cast, nice smidgen tasty gratuitous female nudity, funky hum'n'shiver score, and lots of extremely rough and grotesque makeup f / x. Bonus points for the fact that the token excitingly cutesy the little girl gets one big reptile and for the stoner engineer who gets caught smoking a burst from a hollow bulb (!?). An absolute shooter of kitsch howling.
