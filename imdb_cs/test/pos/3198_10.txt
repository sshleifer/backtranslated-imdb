I caught it as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland and was simply brilliant; Saving the grace of what was another wise forgotten, just a bad grouping of movies. <br /> <br /> Perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent but simple animation, that's just a cat story chasing the moon. Funny, charming and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romance and all the others who appreciate how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your city, look. This short price is worth the entrance fee.
