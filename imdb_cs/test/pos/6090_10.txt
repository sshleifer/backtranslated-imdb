I like this movie over all the others. It is "multilayer"; there is so much to see and appreciate. Each browsing brings a new appreciation of story, plot and character. Flawlessly acted and very enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love interaction between players; fine relations; period. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast when a promising lover and Geoffrey, a disappointed husband, cheats Colin Firth beautifully. The scene in the sandstorm, where Catherine & El-masses discuss different types of sandstorms, is one of the highlights of the film and where the matter begins. Another relationship between Hanna & El-masses is another "layer" of a movie that is absolutely charming (and heartbreaking). Good winner of so many awards.
