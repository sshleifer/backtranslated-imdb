I wonder how someone could say goodbye to this movie. It is based on a real story. It's not necessarily about "Rugby" itself, so the one that is posted here that they need to do a "real" rugby movie, you missed. This is not another typical sports movie where the team sucks, hires Emilio Estevez and turns the team around to win the championship and give everyone warm and fuzzies. Focuses on STORY. It shows how someone can change their lives for the better. Movies are now days about sex, drugs, parties, etc. That's Hollywood. I am a big fan of movies, but I have to say that it was an inspiring film with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", don't watch the movie, it won't meet your standards. If you want to watch a good, inspiring movie, it's good.
