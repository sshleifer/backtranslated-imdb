I've seen many Shahrukh's films and that is a very good role for him. It has such versatility, but mainly remains in positive roles. As Rahul he is very dark and disturbing, yet I have been very sympathetic to him. If anything else, watch this movie for Shahrukh. He very convincingly plays a very complex and real character. The story is very typical and was done earlier, but the character development is very strong and fun. Opening is a little confusing, but it doesn't matter at the end. The songs I found very sympathetic give a look at what the characters think. Very clever. I think this movie was very good and I recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. It is visible!
