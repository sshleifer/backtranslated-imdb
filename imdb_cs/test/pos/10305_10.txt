A very moving and stimulating film that raises questions of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sounds a little too heavy? It is a little bit, but all of that is done realistically straight forward in the story of the changes taking place in the family that has to deal with these things. This is a positive story that stands in the way of life and responsibility, which is not the subject matter. Afterlife is a beautifully made and created film in modern times and dealing with modern issues. It's a character driven, fascinating movie with a strong cast and a few very good performances. Unfortunately this is not the type of movie that always works well at the box office, so catch it when you can.
