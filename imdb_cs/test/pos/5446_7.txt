"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television show. At his exhibition he talks about a variety of things, but his main focus is on political issues he is very convinced of. One day on his show, a fan of the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for the President of the United States. After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and vote their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the president for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decided to run for president and low and won the election. Everything seems to be planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and starts to dispute his position. A funny but serious political thriller follows? The person who enters this movie and waits to see a brainless comedy will be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are movie traders when I see how they introduce their marketing campaigns. The "Man of the Year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from poster to trailer to online advertising makes this film such a comedy. Frankly, I must say that about 1/3 of the film is funny, while the rest is a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows viewers to think. In this case, I was surprised that if the marketing was done deliberately, because this film solves quite serious problems between his comic routine. But we're getting a lot of marketing. Br /> <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year", although I expected to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I will do with this movie is that the film switches between comedy and drama decent work, although at first it seems a bit embarrassing. I really think that after you think about it, the film will be a political thriller rather than a comedy you like. Some may not, because they believe they see a comedy and do not understand what this film is trying to say in the end, but for those people who can blame the traders for not informing the film. "Man of the Year" talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs talks, he says things to say and not about their sweets. I also think that the whole political subplot, while most critics say the movie was probably injured probably because of misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computer voting has been thrown in the last few years, and it could certainly be realistic with all the problems this film deals with. Also, big business controls have over voting also dealt with. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, I think everyone involved has done a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny but at the same time seriously play Tom Dobbs. Some say Williams overcame his welcome as a comedian, but I still think he's funny and he's also a good sergeant. It's probably one of the few opportunities that we see him go back and from serious to funny and I think it works well. It's also nice to see Lewis Black co-star in a decent movie. Again, I like Black when she appears on "The Daily Show" and does get up however most of the movies that were in were terrible. It was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit into the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a great addition to the cast and proves again to be a very good actress, and finally Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum do a very good job as they always do when these roles are handed over to them. "The Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, a man who brought us such films as "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog." Levinson does a great job of writing and directing the film. As I said, I know that a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the movie, but I thought it fits nicely. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a great job with this movie. Finally, don't expect to see a movie that sells your ads to this movie. He has a laugh, but also plays more as a political drama. It's not as stupid or stupid as your marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film, which was not a typical Hollywood movie. She tried to be both a comedy and a serious drama and worked for me at least. I like the fact that the movie didn't really dampen any of the questions he was dealing with, nor did he have a typical Hollywood ending. I tried to call the end, but surprisingly it didn't end up as I thought it pleased me. It's a movie that will make you laugh, but then a few minutes later you will be able to think and think about what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will be hurt by his bad marketing.
