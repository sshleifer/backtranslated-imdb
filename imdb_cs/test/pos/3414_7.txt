A warmly sentimental story by The Waltons. If somebody gave me the material, I would probably dismiss him as too much muggle. But dramatization here controls the tear without the expected embarrassment. Nobody in the fifties was better at hunting than Arthur Hunnicutt. His attraction here is given to perfect use as a mountain man who is faithfully loyal to a loyal hunter. Their fates are bound as inseparably as any human ties. Good. I see a gentle environmental report here. All the animals go to heaven because of how we can condemn every poor devil who follows the instinct to stay alive. There is no illusion in the kingdom of animals, and yet, as we treat them cruelly. An extremely satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
