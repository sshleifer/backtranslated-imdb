"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary made for HBO by two pairs of heroin lovers roaming the streets of NYC. One night I managed to catch it by accident and I found it absolutely charming. There is no narration and we will never see any conversations with the subjects, the camera is followed around, like the third eye, completely separate. People who are being watched do not even realize they are being filmed! (or at least not interested). The shots are amazingly honest. Some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. That's as real as it goes. Nuts and bolts of what he wants to be on the street and addicted to heroin. We look at them as they score, shoot, create, look for, and even pursue cops to rob people, and about a million other minor details left to less attentive documentary filmmakers. Some shots are really scary. Just like watching one guy lost a furious search for repair. I found myself praying to find him just to temporarily end his suffering. And when he finds it, the man literally dances on the street. The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent in monitoring this condition. Everything is about getting another score on these guys, but the next score seems to be well worth the tremendous issues that go over. <br /> <br /> I'd like to get a copy of this if someone knows where it's available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
