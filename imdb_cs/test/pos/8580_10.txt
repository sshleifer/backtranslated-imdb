*Warning! Some spoilers! Matt, a wealthy writer, is actually still just a boy in his behavior. He is not interested in anyone but in his own needs, and cannot care for the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he recognizes Nimi and her ties with her family and her community, she begins to feel that something is missing in her life. He begins to realize that he's actually lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just comfortable but have no heart and determination. Yet he gives up any responsibility and is reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to re-establish himself in his old life and ignore the bonds that are already - unconsciously - formed? His situation is quite the opposite. It is pushed into the rules of its Nigerian community, its prejudices and medieval values. Being a single mother is her difficult position and it is even worse when she falls in love with Matt, the white devil (as the Referend said), the man who cannot commit. Community women plan to take her to a referendum to end their only status, and give Sammy a "name". But that would mean giving up all independence and self-determination with them. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and become a respected member of the community? This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (VERY sexy Matt and Nimi Scenes) and a cute baby who is eagerly connected, beautiful scenery in vivid colors. Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's amazing to watch them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy just dies. You just want to accept him. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk together. Both ways are on the same level. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about Sex. This scene is absolutely adorable !! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain about. It is not true. One thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough! (And maybe the Referend is too bad and too stupid to be persuasive ....) 10 out of 10, by all means!
