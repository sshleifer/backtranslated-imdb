This is a very noir episode. It starts with Jim, who returns from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, recently divorced by Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - the daughter of John Huston who knew a few things about the noir movie) and her daughter. When she arrives, Karen goes to the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and takes her to her room. He then finds out Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he would call Dennis, and when the police arrive, he sees no sign of Karen, but murdered a neighbor in the neighborhood of the bush. So obviously Jim is an immediate suspect. This is a big little mystery and the first half of the story is shown to Rocky that Jim wants to go back to the story. Rocky suggests that Jim tells him a story that he could remember about the little detail he didn't think was important at the time, but could now lead to the notion of what had happened. It is a really well-written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from the grifter to the parent concerned. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky is not just some clueless old man either. As he says, "You're coming to me because I'm your father. And I'm smarter than you!" This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts. This episode also features the appearance of hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the "Dark Shadows" series and went on to play Laura. Banner, Bruce's wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series a few years later. It's looking great. This episode also marks the first mention of Minette's criminal family, a name that would still appear on Rockford Files almost always when they needed a crowd family. This time, his Vincent Minette, who Rockford helps to hold back. <br /> <br /> Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series, and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was in an earlier season one episode to Sargent Police. I think they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, although I prefer Lt. Chapman Lt. In this episode there is not much typical humor "Rockford", but a good secret with a lot of heart.
