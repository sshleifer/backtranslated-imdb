He plays straight, but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the best cops in film history. Roy Scheider plays in the French connection a poor man who has a bit of the same courageous attraction. FC is a better movie, but I prefer watching this one because 1) I think Scheider is great and that's his best movie, and 2) He has the best car chase EVER that makes Bullitt look like cable production driver). It doesn't hurt that Tony LoBianco stops (re) playing baddie. Please.
