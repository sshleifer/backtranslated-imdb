I saw this movie with a live performance by Buffalo Philharmonic and the music was one of two things that definitely made me experience; especially the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating. The second thing that cost me is the battle on the ice, a bit of a strategy that was thoroughly detached in 2004 by the makers of King Arthur. Also, the battle lasts forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can't think of another propaganda film that would make the war less charming or rewarding. I am surprised that Stalin liked this film so well; I wouldn't go out and fight after watching.
