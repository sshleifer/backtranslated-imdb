This show is really great. It's smart. It is funny. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. Dialogs are really funny and well functioning. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have great chemistry. You really believe that they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that relationships with her mother needn't be just a mother and daughter, they can be the best friends, but at the same time it shows that it's really hard to be more than just a mother and daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just watch this show highly recommendable. It's great and definitely the best show in the air. Season 7 Stars Tuesday 26 September 2006, 8/7c on the new The CW
