Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath Part One on the amazing DVD Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy from CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Another is the rage of the undead. Now this one left me a little confused about several conspiracy holes and some confusing twists here and there, but it's a better film on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a big leap in style and talent between the two movies. Again, it's not for people who want shine and Hollywood style horror movies, it is for people who love their bloody zombies, raw and grainy. The story, as I could say, was essentially about two criminals who in 1945 tried to steal an older couple just to find out that the couple were members of the cult. One person is simply killed and the other, the one who is in charge, is basically transformed into a scarecrow and crucified and stands in a nearby field, still alive, but dying. Today's cut and delivery full of college kids are breaking near the farm. At the same time, a group of convicts escapes from a nearby prison. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was the one in which the former elderly man lived, and when one of the convicts knocks down a scarecrow and takes his jacket, he causes the scarecrow to wake up and he brings the cult members back from the dead. Wow. And that's all in the first half hour. There is another plot also going on in the city where a couple of serial killers have taken some workers at the hostage deli. This actually works because people trapped in the house will finally escape and end up in the same Deli. Most of the twists work pretty well, but it is clear that the film was in some places too complex for its own good. All this ends with a huge reckoning with the remaining heroes who find a van or something full of bacteria vials. Of course it suits the undead and causes some great melting, and a few heads explode and then we get a strange, provocative ending. First let me say that although it wasn't always easy to watch, I still had a great time with this movie. It was fun and acting was good enough for a low budget effort. It was clear that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and he succeeded in that. It had better special effects than the first film, great stimulation and great music and visual effects, plus a really real screen from INSIDE's mouth when a knife is jammed. Care was taken here and shows. Weakness lies in scripting and several lazier performances. Again, I recommend listening to the commentary track. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. As well as finding that some scenes were filmed on the Super 8 film for effect, and that the film returned from the lab destroyed and could not be used. And they've already edited the movie when the movie got back, so some of the confusion comes from several non-movie scenes. I also learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love to do Horror movies. Shows. The film is a good example of any budget cinema that could use one more rewrite, but still shines more than most DV movies I see. It's not as fun as the first movie, though technically better. I really admire Leaves as one of the true innovators and pioneers in the field of DV cinema ... and this is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
