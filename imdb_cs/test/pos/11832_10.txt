I loved this movie - the actors were amazing and fit their roles. The story itself was great (and the true environment was perfect and the message of the human response to war, danger and risk was exceptional. The person who wrote the musical score also made music for Life is beautiful (another my favorite)) that "... it wasn't like an English movie, it was like an Italian movie." I think he's right! Callum Blue is perfect for Eric Newby's part. He wants to follow a story that is true and morally uplifting, as well as a beautiful love story.
