From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the beginning, at least for me, when I saw how I expected it to be an American run. But it was somewhat different - a fun-loving guy who completes high school and does his own college, leads her accordingly. As you can expect, there are plenty of parties and hot girls in bikinis, but this movie has tried more than the average teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages her students / peers to learn through freedom of speech and eventually "push it into the system". The humor was varied, which I loved. All casts brought fantastic performances - hire this with a friend, it's a bloody blockbuster!
