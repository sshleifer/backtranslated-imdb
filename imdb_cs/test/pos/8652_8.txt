A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealist collection. Recommended browsing for those who like their movies complicated. My interpretation of the "strange" end would be that Andreas's journey ends in hell. He does not like the lackluster consumer emptiness of purgatory; some kind of "alive" but impenetrable, ie nowhere to get - even subway trains do not stop at stations. It has a metro system like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never board these trains. He is unable to reach the fragrant, sensory sky and finish his bus journey to the finish. The old Scandinavian version of hell (Hades, not hell, earthly city) is not as hot as the British version, its cold, freezing, land of Niflheim (land cold and fog). It seems that where Andreas ended, he just failed to access the sky through this tunnel.
