Like the first one, the JACKASS team is back to try to kill themselves in any way they see fit. \ TEither, it's fitting themselves in a tractor tire and rolling down a slope. Or they deliberately broke the bull themselves. Something even worse. The first one was crazy, and that's how you can describe it. It was also really hard to laugh with the movie. But this is absolutely nuts.It's even more dangerous stunts, and even harder laughter. <br /> <br /> Before BORAT comes out I will laugh A ** out.
