Over the years I have enjoyed both Van Dykes and I was happy to watch them again. <br /> <br /> Just as cute and fun and easy to watch and enjoy. Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed it more when he got older. Son Berry was a great follower in his father's footsteps. Together they make a great team and work well together. I am disappointed that I have not found another 101 murder that is listed anywhere. I've seen both of those that have been shown. I hope it will be more because it's a really fun duo to watch. You can be sure that Berry follows in the footsteps of his father, speaks the same and has the same mannerisms. You'll enjoy something they do separately. <br /> <br /> You will surely follow everything they do together and together.
