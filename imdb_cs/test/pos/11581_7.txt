I suppose it is a success that it is possible to introduce a real tail to a audience of a fragile man; the tail, in which the protagonist spends most of the film on his back, in bed and completely unable to move. And yet, success in film efficiency is a dramatic piece; As a memory of the real story and I think as an argument why people should have the right to die if they wish. However, the film is not a political statement, and fortunately it avoids too many scenes of debate, even if it contains one argument in any case. It is one of those films in a foreign language that presents its leading character as a cripple who can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet be able to meet him as engaging and persuasive. So rather than being out and out of argument, the movie is a more sweet but timely dramatic piece about another person who wants something or looking for something; The only difference is that achieving this "goal" would mean ending one's life and being physically out of nowhere. Javier Bardem plays the real life of Galicia Ramón Sampedro, an individual who, at an earlier age, plunged into a clearing of water that was too shallow for such activity. This brought him a bed for the rest of his life and his desire to die is the focus of the film by Chilean director Alejandro Amenábar. We have seen in our lives as many films in which characters have certain "goals" or goals that one has to fulfill before the film ends to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change in the pace in the sea is subtle; does not include young, energetic, appealing heroes who go to battle in remote places, but a real person for something that means so much to them. Even if you have a strong policy, either Pro or against euthanasia you may find yourself hoping that Ramón will get everything he wants at the end. The film gives its tone very early when Ramón is giving a lecture on why he wants to die of watching family members, instantly introducing the situation and submitting to a watching audience that may not know what the film is about. Interestingly, some of the family members are "against" what they want, which could place all members of the audience who feel strongly on the subject in their shoes. However, the purpose of this setting is to tell the audience: "No, this is not one man after something that his whole family supports him by the way." Quite easily, the movie could go down the road in which it is Sampedro family vs.. all others but some are anti-Ramón idea; some are too young to realize what's going on, and others are seemingly too upset to even have a different opinion than to just want Ramón to stay a little longer, but in the end they love him. Sea Inside is a story that revolves around the victim. Ramón is a quadriplegic and it's the perspective we see things from. This is something that may disagree with the audience, or the film will appear quite strange, given that we are presented by a film from the victim's point of view, rather than an instigator or leading figure in a film that always causes the film's cause. cause and effect disc. But this is no criticism and it is the director's credit for applying such an approach in the effective way it is. The film asks questions; offers its viewers a script. If you were in the position of Ramona: what would you do or think about what you are dreaming about or what are you talking about? As a result, the dreams of the lawyer Juile (Rueda) are not shot enough to please the audience, as they are still such a tiny window to the fantastic fantasies of one man in his troubles. Julie's study intensifies a little later when she shares some similarities with Ramon, and that is when she begins to have strokes that are the result of her own illness. This feature seems to be timely in terms of progressing their relationship, and adds another link component at the top of the already involved friendship. This is because Julia feels physical pain and restraint, not in the sense that she is unable to get up and walk, but I think she is aware of the value of life she has felt, emotionally felt before. While the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of euthanasia, it feels more like a drama on Earth about a person in a situation where he is ready to fight for what he wants, but he must do it verbally. It's refreshing to see movies like The Sea Inside because it not only refers to history and gives us insight into it, but as a stand-alone film brings it to an emotional and engaging level.
