This movie is special, but I really liked it. It's about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their baffled honeymoon. she doesn't love her back and she is the average son of a bitch. he starts to love her after something happens on their honeymoon that really happens. its weird yeah! but different from other films in a good way I think. I don't know what to compare, but his love story. But he has a lot of funny stuff too. like seeing James Franco in wig. I really liked Notebook and it was a bit of a love story. but the rest is different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie on a test screener because she likes a lot and her fashion. I liked her in the factory, but this is a better movie than it was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but i don't know <br /> <br /> see !!!!
