Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, strict scripts, varied and interesting places, great guest stars and movie atmosphere, all together to make this series special. Unfortunately, Andrew Keir has handed over and Sascha Hehn of Germany does not (unfortunately) seem to have enjoyed a small screen in his home country. ABC has repeated many times, but the release of the DVD will not happen. The series is timeless. It is so likely that it will strike a resonant chord with the audience today as it did in its own day. Let's ABC ... release The Outsiders on DVD !!!!!
