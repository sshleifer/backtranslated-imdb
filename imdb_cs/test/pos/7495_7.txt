"Thursday" is a good movie, but we recognize too many other films in its genre and therefore lack originality. If you've seen 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and lots of other movies that have been inspired by the last one you have seen almost every part from 'Thursday'. There is a scene that includes torture that even has the same dialogue as in Tarantino 'Reservoir Dogs'. Still, it's a good movie. Because not every part is taken from the same movie, the whole thing has new ideas and nice details. The opening sequence that begins is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James Le Gros). They get into battle with a gas station clerk over a cup of coffee and end up with the death of the clerk and the arrival of a cop. We've already looked at the suitcase with a lot of money. Then we'll meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but has worked with Nick. He knows nothing. Then Nick calls him and says he is coming. We learned that he has his friends and the problems are about to start. What happens exactly is not to reveal, but to meet other characters who are interested in money or drugs, Nick and him. Casey flushed the garbage. Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very funny sub-plot involving actor Michael Jeter and a few surprises (even if you really think about it, seeing them coming) is a good movie with some very fine shows , nicely directed by Skip Woods.
