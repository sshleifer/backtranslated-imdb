I found this one more chaotic than the average Stooges short (as special as it may sound). There were a few funny pieces, especially running gags ("Dr. Howard's call, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", Glass doors broke, Stoogs ran into the supply room and came back with ... well, you knew), but also enough of it being accepted with things that made no sense to me. I have to assume that it was generally about taking off scenes from the movie "Men in White", but because I don't know much about the movie, I can't say for sure. Maybe if anyone could explain it, I'd appreciate it even more.
