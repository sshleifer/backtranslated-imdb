After Kate learned that her sister Susan was considering divorce, she decided to travel to a distant far-away home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone murdered her and stuffed her body in the basement. When the storm rages outside, Kate tries to find out where the nurse could go and put her own life in great danger ... the killer is still in the area! Elizabeth Montgomery in her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle gives a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on the McKnight Malmar story. Malmar's story was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER series anthology. THRILLER is very close to the story, which is a shame, because he could use a little punching. Granted by Malmar wrote a slightly spooky number, but Gerard (creator of ONE STEP BEYOND show) adds some clever ingredients that increase tension and tension.
