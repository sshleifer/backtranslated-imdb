John Huston, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as "Misfits" and "African Queen," directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be his last film. Indeed, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on James Joyce's novel of the same name, "Dead" tells the silent story of the New Year's celebration in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son Tony, created the jewel of the film. The short story is among Joyce's best work (as well as being only that is filmable). The film is a tribute to Huston's genius. He took a small, beautiful story and made a small, beautiful movie. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (though "shine" is too conspicuous, too false a word that describes their silent, undervalued performance). "The Dead" reflects the love of the Huston family for Ireland and is in its own calm way a suitable film for the legend.
