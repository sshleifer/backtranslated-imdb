First, nothing will ever be compared to the original film, but for the hell it doesn't. What might have happened after Rhett left Scarlett in Tara is just one person's opinion. I thought it was an amazing movie and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery makes me watch a movie. Just watch this movie as an extension of the original and don't think it's trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and enjoy it. Indeed, in many scenes they have captured Scarlett's spoiled selfishness and you can see from Rhett's desire that Scarlett is still in love. The fact that you can recognize many actors in the movie is another plus, though some of them have been seen only on television. I always wanted them to have more children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie, and that was absolutely satisfying. <br /> <br /> Lore60
