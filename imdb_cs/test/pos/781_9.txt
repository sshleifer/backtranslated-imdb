I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films looked at something and released it, which is generally a good sign, but I am not normally a Julie Walters fan, I generally dislike her role in comedy (sorry to all fans, but it's a personal thing - I can't find her funny in comedy. <br /> <br /> It was amazing - great performance, but Grint and Walters are extraordinary! Lots of laughter, lots of pathos, great timing and a beautifully moving movie - such a coming of film Normally there was something I wouldn't expect to like, but I can't recommend it enough - and watch Rupert Grint maturing into a fine actor.
