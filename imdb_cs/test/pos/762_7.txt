I thought it would be a lousy movie, frankly, Rupert Grint, RON, acting in a film different from Harry Potter, was actually really hard to imagine. But as the movie started, this guy turned out to be a talent, I think he's the best HP trio actor, for information, did you see Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel? Both lack experience, even though they were in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, unable to show his real feelings about everything, his contempt for his over ruling mom and angry anger towards his father, who is unable to escalate and confront his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely great! Her interpretation of an old retired actress tries to live in the shade of her past while she is absolutely amazing while trying to remember Shakespearean sonnets! It also seems that many youths are unnecessary in religious nonsense.
