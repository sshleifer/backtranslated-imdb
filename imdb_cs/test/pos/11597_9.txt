If you go to the cinema to have fun, have fun, make your time, don't go out of the way to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of the human species, feelings of real people, explore the character of the personality, go to the cinema to absorb the beautiful photo, be sure to place this movie very high on the list, preferably in the first place. Experience is deeply rewarding and causes intelligent viewers to think about the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenábar has surpassed the best he has done so far, and even bought some deviations in his earlier movies that whipped on Hollywood. This is not the case with this visual music poem: Hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this armor-inspired armor - and human - story. In no way should 'Mar Adentro' be interpreted as an excuse for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of Galician fisherman Ramon Sampedra, is a scream from the bottom of the heart for life and love, addressing human compassion, understanding emotions. Sampedro was an artificial and intelligent man who, following a diving accident from the rocks on the Galician coast, was convicted as a young man to live in bed for another 27 years. "Condenado and Vivir" (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life I have already commented on. However, Amenábar managed to remarkably portray this man, with his lasting mysterious smile and witty sense of humor, as articulated and intelligent. And Javier Bardem rose to the occasion, met the challenge head -on, accompanied by a Galician accent, producing an electrifying, compelling, charming performance, such that the actor and the fisherman merge into being the same person on screen. Indeed, it is an opportunity to make a cap and gently murmur 'chapeau'. In his quest, Bardem is driven by a spectacular cast, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (qv) and Clara Segur, Galician and Catalan accents that play a significant role. The Amberbar produces wonderful dialogues because the six rotate among themselves, or in groups with excellent chemistry, proving that this young Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is and how to achieve his results; his global film concept includes his own music, scattered pieces of Beethoven and Puccini on the Sampedro recorder. While watching 'Mar Adentro' I found myself several times in comparison with him and this movie with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'Clock' (qv). I mean the way dialogues work with tense and passion and that careful sense of timing in every scene. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is as good as usual. As I mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he just does not film events and scenes - he captures the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, skilfully catches his eyes, light and shadows so that his work behind the camera is suddenly another player in the story. Excellent artist. 'Mar Adentro' is another milestone in the history of Spanish cinema, between five or six works of art created over the last 25 years. This film is based on cinematographic art such as El Sur (qv), "Los Santos Inocentes" (qv), "El Abuelo" (qv), "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (qv), "Las Ratas" (qv) , 'Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I have to add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). A greatly managed story of a real man and those who loved him around his bed: don't miss it.
