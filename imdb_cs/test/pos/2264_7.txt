In America, Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects his family's personal belongings for remembrance. A few moments before death, Grandma gives an old photo of her grandfather to a woman named Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to where the picture was taken to find Augustine, and along with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a strange dog, they travel an old car looking for Jonathan's missing past . "Everything Is Illuminated" is a special movie about a strange young man with a compulsive behavior collecting souvenirs from his family so that they don't forget who are looking for his grandfather's past to understand how his life could be if he his grandfather moved to the USA. This bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family who owns an amateur travel agency specializing in helping Jews to find missing relatives and together they have an almost surreal trip across Ukraine. The film begins as a comedy, with sarcastic black humor and ends in the moving and tragic drama recommended for a particular audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Uma Vida Iluminada" ("Illuminated Life")
