This movie came out at about the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: a rich man meets and learns to love a poor working-class woman, the figures of Romuald and Juliette are much nicer and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten them and consider a film that is better than a Pretty Woman in many ways. Juliette is a remarkable woman, and she will encourage you with clever ways to help your boss overcome his problems. The last scenes include some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy. Romuald's effort to win the love of Juliette has surpassed a hundred times the clever climbing scene of Pretty Woman. Take a look at this movie, warm your heart.
