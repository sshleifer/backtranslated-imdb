The network is an excellent movie! It's about Angel Bennett (in the great performance of Sandra Bullock), a computer expert who works for Cathedral Company, cleans the virus and tests games for clients. Angela is a typical nerd who doesn't have friends outside of cyberspace, almost doesn't take holidays and doesn't go out and stays almost all the time. One day her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him and send Angela a disc with a strange program that has a lot of confidential information. At the same time Dale was about to meet her, she was suddenly killed in a plane crash. Angela encounters a beautiful guy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) during her vacation in Mexico, who shows he's a cold blood bastard. and one of the guys behind the floppy disk. Her life then turns into a nightmare: All her records are erased and she gets a new Ruth Marx identity, a woman with serious police problems. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how we people depend on a lot of computers and machines (sometimes more than we should) and how vulnerable we are if someone chooses to control and change our personal records without allowing us to prove an error.
