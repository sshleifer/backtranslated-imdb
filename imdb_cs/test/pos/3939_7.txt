Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" gives us a glimpse of a huge, American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, this theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American" as we are taken through the fast clips of his many performances in Westerns, and scenes from "Meet John Doe," "Mr. Deeds Goes to the City, and" Sgt. The best work of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family, as well as his childhood photographs, which show him as a beautiful blond child with a sunny smile that has had his whole life. Cooper on "The Jack Benny Show" makes a comeback on "Bird Dog" - and Benny loses it, and the documentary also takes us shortly through his turbulent affair with Patricia Neal, who almost destroyed their lives. There is no coherence in this bio / retrospective - it jumps a lot and has no conversations with Cooper, which would add a lot, and Clint Eastwood's narrative was described as inconspicuous. Since Cooper tended to be a strong, quiet type on the screen, we could use a small animation. On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the prettiest men ever to be. he lived - some were watching him in his early films, it wasn't nearly enough for this fan. The smile, the lips, the bone structure - he was nice all his life, but in movies like "Morocco" and "Desire," is devastating. Instead of sitting across the scene from one of his worst appearances, Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead", who said he admitted to the author he didn't understand - young, great Cooper in tux would be a nice touch. Unfortunately, this document was definitely made by a man.
