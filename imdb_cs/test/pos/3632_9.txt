A very moving film, a big surprise from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social issues, violence, sex ... Magic Realism is a very difficult task and I believe João Falcão did it beautifully. It seems he really didn't want to make a realistic movie, far from it. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the game, he said in his interviews that the film was actually based on a book. Another mistake is that Falcão was influenced by the "Hojé Dia De Maria" series. The TV series produced by Globo was made after the movie, but aired before ... Unfortunately. Negative is Walter Carvalho's photo. It does not seem to have caught or understood the concept created by Falcão. The story is charming and versatile, although it is set in a small town in Brazil. This could happen anywhere in the world. Great movie, I recommend.
