As a French, I found it very pleasant that I could laugh at the old stereotype, which is made from French, as is the case with some Westerners, on Spy movies, etc. And on many other things. ... I've seen it three times and every time I have discovered new things and laughed at tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, director Aure Atika and all the actors, all crew members have done a fantastic job. This movie is funny, but it is much more than that: it has a lot of levels on it. You laugh for simple grafts because some critics have a joke (the film is brave enough to be critical) because of the physical comedy because you believe in characters, etc. It is also aesthetically and musically successful. Go if you can.
