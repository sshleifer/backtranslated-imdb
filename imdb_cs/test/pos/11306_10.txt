I normally try to avoid Barbie movies, but this was absolutely amazing. Kudos to graphics and voice character overs. It all went well. This charming story is a great spin off of others, but is well worth buying! I have no children, but the children I watch (including boys) are interesting and love the other features on the DVD. I honestly don't know why it's rated so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin '8 years will love it. It's not straightforward and predictive, like most movies. This "child" movie has excellent morale and shows teamwork. It has no swearing, bits of romance (if your old enough to figure it out) and a beautifully written story. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
