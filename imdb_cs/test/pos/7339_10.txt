Anyone who has worked on this film has done AMAZING. This is frankly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in LONG. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything came first. As a passionate fan of the genre (lesbian movies and gymnastics), I was so incredibly pleased with this film. It really gave me a lot more than I expected. Hearing Q & A with cast and crew was great, the main actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and kind, it is a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what is really important. And the writer did the hell job, as well as directing and editing was amazing. Thanks a lot for a great movie! I also thank for the line about "if you're going to slap on the label, it would be bisexual". I am so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes die homosexuals or straight, it's amazing to see bisexuals who have recognized themselves as existing and are part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels were not necessary at all . What end! Just as I thought it wouldn't give me more, he did it. Beautiful work and my applause to everyone. I will spread the word, this is definitely a movie that you must not miss!
