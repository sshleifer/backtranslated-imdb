This is definitely a moving movie and a great expression of Charles Darwins' personal struggle. The film is not just about his attempt to get his book "Origin of Species" published, but also his relationship with his eldest daughter. His daughter was the only person in her family at the outset to approve his opinions for what she had to pay for. Een more than he occasionally. Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact, I think it has managed to remain very neutral. The hard thing to do in my opinion. Of course, this does not mean that churches have treated characters, quite the contrary. If you need me to use big words to shed light on this movie; it will appeal to both the deists and the atheists, but it will break away from theism. The film talks about evolution, and that's it. Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as that old man with funny beard, but this film is centered around the man in his late twenties, the early 1930s. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwins. Definitely at the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it is beautiful. Except for a few jumps in the time that was confusing at the moment, the production of this film is perfectly flawless. Some of the scenes Darwin observes are simply amazing, and are almost as out of high production as the National Geographic Document. I must admit that I'm not entirely sure why they chose "Creation" as a name. I doubt it's irony, the film is too respectful for it. Well, I'm sure it also makes sense, don't let it scare you. I give this movie 9/10. This is a really great tribute to Charles Darwin and give him a chance.
