I liked this show, it was in the UK, but not in peak hours, and they seemed to move around the plan, so I couldn't watch them all. I was surprised when he didn't come back and I had no idea why, I still don't, but I don't think it's important. <br /> <br /> Great performances from both leaders were very trustworthy as friends. Two supporting actresses also contributed well to this combination. I think it was part of the whole fair that focused on lifestyle. Friends were obviously the main ones, but sex in the city came a few years later. <br /> <br /> Characters, take coffee, drink in nice bars, something like that, a little woody.
