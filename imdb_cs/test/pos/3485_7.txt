Because of his predictable, second-class title (at least in Italy, which was distributed in Italy), I didn't expect much from this film. He thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "Cursed House"). Well, I had to change my mind right after the first brilliant scene! The constant presence of the priests and the creepy atmosphere reminded me of a little Exorcist and some of his decent Italian rip-offs, but this will be something completely different ... That's more of a Hitchcock who meets an Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried not to spoil the "7 Hyden Park" viewing, which I would recommend to all. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong, or when Joanna crawls or tries to stand up hard (is paralyzed from the waist down) will her feet and legs move a little? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
