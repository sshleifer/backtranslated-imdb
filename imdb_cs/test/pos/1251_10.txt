It's so nice to see Bruce Willis come down from his throne and see he's a really talented actor. In this film shines as an almost forty-year-old consultant who has completely lost contact with his inner child - when he meets him face to face. It is one of those rare films that do not tell their audience and really offer something for the WHOLE family. The point is to take care of each other, hold a baby inside, and realize that you are growing up exactly as you thought you would. Willis seems to be building an impressive record for working with children (just a witness "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment) and has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin. There is some nice photos and music, and the end is gorgeous and uplifting. A great movie with every member of your family.
