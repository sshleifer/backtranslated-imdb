It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I disagree with a person who said it was boring. Of course some people may find that this film is not terrifying at all, but I personally spent a very good moment. This film is changing very well with sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example, when a wife tells her husband that she was abused by her father in childhood, her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you" and then try to join her for a sex game bed: D Very funny! I recommend this movie to everyone, by the way, sorry for my bad English (I'm from France).
