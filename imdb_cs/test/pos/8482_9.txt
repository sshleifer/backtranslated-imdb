Like almost everyone, I'm familiar with Ray Charles's music. Who hasn't heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some of the other amazing songs this movie contains. But unfortunately I was unaware of Ray Charles's life until I watched it. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life. His performance was strong, all the way to mannerist and vocal changes. The film also offered no-held-barred description of some trials and tribulations Charles engaged during his life, and with some demons from the past it haunted him well into adulthood. Perhaps the strongest scene in the film was the scene of heroin withdrawal that was painfully realistic. The film depicts Charles's growing awareness and involvement in the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play in a segregated audience in Georgia, leading to a ban on his performance in the state. Also his drug addiction and extramarital affairs are well documented. The film revolves around his mother's plea when he was a child: don't let anyone or any of you make a cripple. "The thing is, the drugs did just that, and to remember his mother's memory, he had to beat them. There's not much about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit, but until then it's really a powerful thing.
