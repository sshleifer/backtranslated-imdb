A fast and fun noir in Vienna just after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cannot find legal work because he has no papers. No papers mean any work permit, which means no way to get a passport. He survives by driving a friend's cabin at night. If they get caught, it means three months in prison. One night she takes a fare in a large hotel and takes a man to an airline. Buka takes the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he discovers that his customer has acquired an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will be able to catch him quickly. No, he needs time to figure it out. He goes to a secluded place, empties his men's pockets and hides his body. Now he has an American passport and a lot of money! He drops contact with the underworld to change the passport photograph. Now he just has to go to a male hotel and pick up a ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say, it would be too simple. Waiting at the hotel is a dead man's lover, Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from her somewhat ugly husband, Francis Lederer, Lederer is, of course, a bitch who blew up a man from Buk's cabin. Camden calls the police because she believes Buka has robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to break out of the mess. Camden falls apart when Lederer's husband appears at the police station. Lederer convinces police Camden suffered a mental disorder and she is released to him. He escapes again, finds Buk, and they both decide to escape. Lederer reappears and Buka has to decide whether to help Camden for his freedom. This movie is much better than I do. Buka is best known as a low-life cop killer in 1950 "between midnight and dawn". The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
