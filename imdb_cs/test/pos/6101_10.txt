*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Wow, what a threat Joanna has found. After she accidentally ran over a small child, she went to call for help just to return to the crime scene amidst a group of very angry viewers. It's too much to handle, and the scene is running away. Fortunately, the child has not died but is seriously injured and in a coma. So begins the biggest fight in Joanna's life: should she keep quiet or talk? At first, he won't do it, but in the end he realizes it's a torture living with such a terrible secret. He even joins the search page in one place to help find the culprit. And gradually the detective begins to question the behavior of this woman. She wants to tell the truth and she never intended to escape from the crime scene, but is it worth saying that the whole city hates you for it? The thing about this movie is that you don't choose parties. Joanna is a very good model, though she has made the wrong decisions. You feel it to her, even though you know what she did was wrong. Her journey is a good representation of what a human being would have done if something like that had happened to them. Margaret Colin is an absolutely great actress. She was amazing in the TV series Now and Again and great in movies like Independence Day and The Devil's Own. Her performance is so realistic and unforced that she carries us unilaterally with the whole film. Finally, I wanted to see her more. Lisa Vidal also provided some good support work as a gentle, resourceful detective. <br /> <br /> If you want to wrap it up, if you want to see a movie that will keep you thinking for a long time, the one who says "That's reality" won't miss this. > My Rating: 9/10
