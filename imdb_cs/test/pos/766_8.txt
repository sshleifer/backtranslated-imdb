I only watched this film because it was Rupert Grint (who I knew from the Harry Potter movie as Ron). I've never appreciated Rupert as an actor in this film. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a great job in this cheerful, unpredictable movie. I think the movie could have been without sex, but somehow it worked. I can't wait to see more Rupert movies in the future. Julie Walters also did an amazing job. He has a very small role in Harry Potter's films, so I didn't even know what to expect from her. But she was as amazing as Dame Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely cheerful. Overall, amazing movie.
