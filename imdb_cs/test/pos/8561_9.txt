I agree that this film has perfectly accomplished its goals. I saw it on Showtime late at night as a teenager and again at college. I thought it was funny. And everywhere are boobs! It looks like a lot of this type of film was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s, from R type films like Porkys to soft-core Au Pair Girls; it is a pity that apparently they have fallen in the way of popularity. The thing that made HOTS great was that, like the previous two movies, it's a hell of a lot of fun. HOTS is like the girl power of the "Animal House" version, with girls who form an association of different species and engage in the campus. On the note side, who suggested "Hooters" girls clothes must definitely see this movie.
