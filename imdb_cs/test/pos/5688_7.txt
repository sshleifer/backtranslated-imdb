I've never heard of this Aussie horror before Michael Elliott's enthusiastic appraisal; after reading it, I decided to check if the DVD is available in my local rental shop (even if it is a German edition, ie without R1), so I decided to check the movie immediately. Even if I didn't go so far as to give him a full mark? only a few selected titles will take them from me, let alone a dark modern movie? I have to say I was pretty impressed with BLACK WATER. Rather than looking back at previous crocodile films such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it evokes the memory of two who saw a small group of people going on a trip, lost, and found themselves at the mercy of disgrace. elements and creatures inhabit the place? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), itself a little observed but impressive Australian production, and OPEN WATER (2005). The compact, simply rendered film includes a pair and a younger sister of a woman who decides to go fishing in the distant and forbidding part of the Australian wilderness known as crocodile territory; very soon (in fact before 15 minutes!) is their ship capsized and the guide killed by the alligator? so our happy adventurers resort to the tree. DVD Talk Reviewer believes the movie suffers from spending too much time at this site? with three arguing about what to do, trying to get a ship, looking for a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to meet anything but water) and an occasional monster attack. However, I think the creators take the situation as far as they can without getting into the tedia: it's because of the tangible tension and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (especially the two women), but also the fact that the crocodile is doing one of the the scariest and most memorable in the last memory (I wonder how they got it to do it)! I also agree with Mike that the movie contains some really effective moments? the alligator jumped out of the water to bite the fossilized heroes; his head suddenly emerged before the women getting ready for the ship; even if one of them gets to the vehicle, the monster manages to lift his massive weight and get into the boat with her!; in the end, as the same girl manages to find a weapon (on the crushed body of her guide), she loads it and lies in waiting for the alligator to appear, and it emerges from behind from behind (by the way, the animal is endowed with the shark's craftsmanship in JAWS [ 1975]). With this in mind, the final is just like the crowd-pleasing (though apparently smaller scale) like that classic Spielberg blockbuster? even if it has a positive follow-up. Another particular benefit is the sparse score of the movie? which is generally rather beautiful but still disturbing at the right moments. At the end of the day, BLACK WATER appears as a breath of fresh air in the face of a demoralizing slump, returning to a horror movie that has fallen late; for this reason, it deserves a bigger exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to resort to the CLOVERFIELD trick to pay attention)?
