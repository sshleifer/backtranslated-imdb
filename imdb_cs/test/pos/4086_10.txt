TV annually publishes dozens of real crime films. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday at Lifetime, and the Court TV can count on several weekends. So I started to follow Morrison's murders when I knew I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent story about a real family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully drama drove me from the beginning to the end. Both brothers were absolutely convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the difficult role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was almost in every frame. If I had a complaint, it was Sheriff Gordon Clapp. He just doesn't look or act like a small town code called Byron Calhoun. It looks and looks like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for that amount. But this is a tiny guess: Morrison's killers are worth watching, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go out, you like it. You will not regret.
