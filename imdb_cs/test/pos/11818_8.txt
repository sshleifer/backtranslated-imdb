The topic of children who are terminally ill is difficult and sad, but "The Cure" successfully portrays the idea that it may not be all destruction and gloom, and if anything, children must have hope and joy in their lives if they are to find peace before end. It is also a film of remarkable volumes of friendship and innocence of childhood. The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional teenage boy with a distant mother who moves to a new neighborhood where their neighbor is next. Eleven-year-old Dexter who has infected AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance of AIDS, Erik befriends Dexter, and their almost fraternal friendship sees them set out on a tour of Mississippi, where they heard about Doctor New Orleans, who claims to have found a cure for the disease. Br /> <br /> The talent of two young leaders Brad Renfr and Joseph Mazzell, who play Erika and Dexter, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik's harder edge without including a subtle childish innocence of her own character, while Joseph portrays a vulnerability to Dexter's character, but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and enthusiasm to emphasize that his illness does not mean that he is still not . He is not a child who wants to run and play like any other 11-year-old boy. The pair's interaction makes the audience feel that they are two boys who are really close and have a good film. Annabella Sciorra also brings a moving performance like Dexter's mother Linda, who adores her son and the pleasures of seeing him with this new friendship with Eric and eventually becoming a surrogate mother number for the other boy. Set Against the Outstanding Soundtrack, "The Cure" is a very bittersweet film that flawlessly twists the story of childhood friendship that will survive steadily amid prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to happiness or unnecessary sweet scenes . A very interesting reflection in the film is that they are adults who have a problem with Dexter's AIDS status, while children, even those "bullying", have accepted it as others did. It is also very touching that, despite Erik's nature, he is more naive in his determination to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has this terrible feeling of knowing his destiny, but is swept away by the enthusiasm of his best friend for treatment. . <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "The Cure" because it is rare to find a film that is both sad and uplifting.
