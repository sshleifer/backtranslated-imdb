This wonderful sequel to the award winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the 1980s. This sequel may be better than the original. This is certainly more family friendly. The language is more subdued. There is a lot of violence and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is especially horrible. However, overall a great movie. Acting is excellent. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. Jon Voight aptly fills Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as captain's call. Ricky Shroder gives a big heart-filled performance as a young boy who grew up with no family to afford. Highly recommended.
