When I went to the video store, back in the days when the DVD still doesn't know me, I saw all the movies in the store I was interested in. The man behind the counter told me he had something for me that I would love. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". At first I doubted it was good, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure I'm happy to take this jewel! This is one of the best adventure movies in years if you ask me! Of course, with Robert Carlyl as the main part, how bad can the movie get? Liv Tyler will surely do what is good again and nothing more: be nice. But still you can very clearly realize that this movie probably had a lot of fun.
