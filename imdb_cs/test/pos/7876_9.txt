My second most popular movie of 1970 (after Five Simple Pieces) was totally rejected by a lot of idiots, calling in a viewer-bait piece of waste. Peter Boyle, a well-known liberal, is incredible as a tough hard worker who has little trouble with the younger generation. It is a scary dude, but it has a great imagination and is very funny. I was a liberal teenager when it was released, but how scary it seemed, Joe, he also burst me! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is a perfect and mixed stone rich fox. The dinner scene in Queens is cheerful and bright for everyone involved. This was not a film about exploitation and the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) was to win this year. The director simply did not throw away enough money to give him enough credibility in Hollywood. It doesn't matter your political persecution, then you will like someone in this movie. Definitive 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check it out!
