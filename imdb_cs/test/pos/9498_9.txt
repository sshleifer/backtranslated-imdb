This is apparently the first movie featuring Gloria Swanson - a film that made her a breaking star. While she was good in the movie, I can't see how this performance was so remarkable at the time - but it was still a very good movie. Gloria plays his wife a wealthy pet, who always takes her for granted. He cares little about his care, eats onions and forgets his anniversary! At the same time, Lothario comes into their lives and begins to pay a lot of attention to Gloria, and her dazed husband doesn't even notice or give him any reason not to cheat him. He finally divorces his husband and marries a smoothly speaking Romeo. However, while the film could be just exaggerated by melodrama (they were quite common at the time), it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and entertaining film. While it's not the biggest silent movie I've ever seen, it's a standout and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the release of Image Entertainment DVD is surprisingly good - with decent print and music. However, this has not always been the case for other versions of the images (especially how skilfully they have mastered the release of Chaplin).
