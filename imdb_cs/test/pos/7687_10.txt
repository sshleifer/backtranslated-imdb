I remember seeing this film as a child in the 1960s. Then I was out of breath at a young age. I was glued to the seat in front of a black and white TV. The cast was one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The musical was the greatest ever written. Please, please, on Gershwin and Goldwyn families, please release on video or DVD so that the generation now and in the future can experience what I'm sure of what so many of us did when we saw this great artwork. not so great a man's work has been visible for years. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will soften and let the world see this great movie again.
