War Chasers On Everything. 5 words I like to follow. The pursuers' war on everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they are waging war with everything. They seem to love hitting politics most of all. Chaser is one of the best comedies I've seen and is up in Australia. It is on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) which is where some of the best comedies are. Last year (2006), the pursuer was aired on ABC Friday night, when everyone was out, so no one could watch him. Well, they were moved to Wednesday evenings at 9pm (heaps of better timeslots) and the best thing is when I miss an episode or even just want to see it again I can download from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
