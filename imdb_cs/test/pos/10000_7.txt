Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows his promising debut, Gothic-Horror "Frailty", with this family-friendly sports drama about the 1913 US Open, where a young American caddy draws on his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as "The Greatest Game Ever Played." I'm not a fan of golf, and these scaly junk sports swings are a dime (lately he has done a great deal with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some how this movie was fascinating as well. The film begins with some creative introductory credits (imagine the Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits HBO "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but it moves slowly after its first hour. When the action moves to the US, things get better. Paxton does a nice job and shows a talent for effective overhead flourishing (I loved the rain-soaked assembly action on day two open) that propel the next plot or add some unexpected psychological depth control. There is some convincing character development when British Harry Vardon is being chased by images of aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family chat as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what is happening in the heads of players under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is lively here. Scenographers and costume departments, who created an engaging periodic atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century, should also have credit for this. You know how it will end not only because it is based on a true story, but also because films in this genre are constantly repeating, but Paxton gives better than the average show, and maybe shows more talent behind the camera than ever before. Despite the formal nature, it is a nice and easy movie to deserve to find an audience.
