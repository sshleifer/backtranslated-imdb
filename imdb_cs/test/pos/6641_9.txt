Apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have married for seven years and live in a small farm on a remote island to escape the civil war on the continent. They provide lingenberry a few customers to get some money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a child, but unwilling Jan, who is a weak and sensitive person, doesn't want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and peaceful life turns to hell, and they reach the center of the accusation on both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) persecutes Eve, John changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the love and affection he feels for any other change of hatred and indifference. "Shame" is the anti-war film of Master Ingmar Bergman focused through the eyes of several artists who are apolitical and do not listen to the news, but when the war arrives in their countries, they have their love, friendship and affection destroyed by senseless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow act as usual and I don't remember seeing Liv Ullmann's breasts in another movie. The process of brutalization of the Pacific and sensitive John Rosenberg by war is an impressive and bleak open conclusion is pessimistic and proportionate to the dramatic story. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
