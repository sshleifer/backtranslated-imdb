Family Guy is the best show on TV. AT ALL. It achieved great things that no other animated sitcom, or any show, even approached to achieve. As for animated sitcoms, this era should be referred to as an "animated sitcom era" because there are so many and almost every one can imagine on a DVD. There are some good (ie South Park, Futurama, and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style of humor. For example, Futurama is funny because it always comments or influences what just happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same comic technique and style that Futurama does, but the Simpsons deserve it because it was on the road ahead of Futurama and still remains in the air using this technique. South Park, in my mind, is the funniest show next to Family Guy because it uses an intelligent blend of vulgarity and stupidity as a technique of making humor. But other animated shows are enough. I'll tell you what makes Family Guy so fun. The Guy Family uses a comedy style that no other show ever used before. It uses a technique to have flashbacks occurring after each joke. This not only strengthens the joke, but makes it seemingly fun. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it the most entertaining show on TV. You must see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will most likely agree. (FYI, two most fun moments on Family Guy were: 1) 5 minute chicken fight in "Da Boom" and 2) Dick van Dyke spoof in "Holy Crap.") Also in my mind Family Guy is a very modest show because while others The programs create humor by getting to know their shticks / routines and characters, most Family Guy jokes are based on the stupidity of contemporary events and pop culture. It also shows that Family Guy is intelligent, except that he is modest because he shows the show's insight. And this technique is very effective because they relate to their pop culture references to specific plot episodes that are found in. <br /> <br /> Family Guy can enjoy all ages because while younger kids may not understand the links to pop culture will be amused by cheerful, stupid opposites of characters, especially Peter. However, the show is slightly more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but is less vulgar than South Park. So, as far as vulgarity is concerned, Family Guy would be somewhere on Wednesday if he was associated with the aforementioned shows, but that would be No. 1 in terms of humor and intelligence !! Unfortunately, the last year was canceled, not because it was not popular, but because FOX changed its time so nobody knew when it was. Fortunately, we have a set of DVD boxes (which are, by the way, sold as crazy) and reappear on the Adult Swim Cartoon Network available to us.
