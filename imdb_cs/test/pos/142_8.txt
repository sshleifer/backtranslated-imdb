We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy (or sympathy trilogy for that matter) you're missing out on some of the best movies of this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it's a vampire movie, but it's also a very twisted story of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into synopsis (you can read that above) but instead tell what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this film is no exception. With some very unreal scenes supported by intense lighting, it fits perfectly into almost every scene. The film starts a little slower, but I felt it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. As things move, they almost never stop until the credits come back. "Thirst" is mostly a love story, but not in the same way you would think. The relationship between the leading characters is very intense, but almost intrusive. Chan-wook Park is not a viewer for the discussion as we know, and this film touches taboo almost as much as old. The end of the scene is by far the strongest in the movie, and perhaps one of the best conclusions to the movie I've seen. Overall, it's an extraordinary film that I feel like all movie buffs should see. It's an exciting (and certainly different) takeover of the vampire world, and romance is far from unhappy or boring. This film is bold, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously, this is not for everyone, but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested in. You see it. Do not hesitate
