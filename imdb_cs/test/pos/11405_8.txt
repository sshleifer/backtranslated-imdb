All you need is a big house, babysitting and a phone. Simon West directs this exciting and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating factor of fear. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) needs to work with an excessive mobile phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting two children Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. Secluded and quiet. The children are already in bed, the wind is building and it is connected with the rain. The phone will ring, ring, and ring. Babysitting is soon in a frantic survival mode in fear of a haunted alien at the other end of the phone. Belle is great as an innocent, clever and powerful teen guard. The voice of the stranger on the phone is the voice of Lance Henriksen, while the physical alien plays Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for atmospheric original music.
