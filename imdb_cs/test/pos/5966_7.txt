ASCENT is a very useful addition to the recent news from the Soviet Union. Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film explores the moral consequences of loyalty and honor in German occupied Russia during World War II. Two members of a Soviet guerrilla group leave on foot and in the blizzard to find supplies and be captured by Nazi soldiers. The film focuses on how each person manages or internalizes their moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity, while others choose to work with the enemy. Eventually, however, he cannot follow his selfish decision. The film uses many slow, wide-angle pans to move to extreme detail and emphasize spiritual embarrassment in every person's souls. This is not a big movie, but it effectively portrays an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of hard and cold Soviet wilderness.
