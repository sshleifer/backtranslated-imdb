When they arrived at their destination, they found out that the angel Michael was completely different from what they expected. However, Frank still persuaded Michael to go with them to Chicago. So an interesting journey started. Although Michael didn't look like a saint, he was a kind angel. In fact, Michael owned an irresistible charming woman. Thanks to the jealousy of other men, he was involved in the rebellion. The peak appeared in the pizzeria. Dorothy sang live songs for Frank. That was what Michael wanted to see. But the next day, Huey's dog crashed on a running car. Michael was asked to save him. This would be used to verify that he was a real angel. Andie Macdowell shined in this comedy. She also showed her singing skills. John Travolta once again demonstrated his comic talent. The cause of Pulp Fiction is still his typical work. <br /> <br /> A comedy that warms your heart. 8/10
