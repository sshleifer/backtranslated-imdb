I saw this movie at the Boston International Cinema Festival last night and I was sad to hear that Mrs. Troche (in her Q&A after the screening) told us that she did not expect to see too many American distributions as a result of her insistence. to include all so-called "homosexual content". It was a FANTASTICKY fun comedy, and it seems to me that American viewers can enjoy it just as they enjoyed "The Full Monty", so it's really unfortunate and so ridiculous that a few shots of two boys who kiss are from the main theater . Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script, and of course, Rose Troche direction to make this one of the funniest movies I've seen.
