I enjoyed the film and the fact that it focused on working with some sophisticated material. I saw the movie in preview, and it wasn't destroyed by any silly video boxes that spoiled the end. The performance was quite good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also enjoyed the look of a movie that gave it a mysterious, forboding air. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" on the plot, and I don't want to put too much away if the video boxes of other countries don't give it all away! The scenario was occasionally a little over the top, but I appreciated the fact that filmmakers were not afraid to challenge viewers with interesting and mysterious aspects about the role of faith in our world. And while some might consider the end too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to neatly connect it to the bow. That's not life.
