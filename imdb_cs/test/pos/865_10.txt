If you've ever been an MTV fan "State", then these three guys will know you, but even if you just hit them over the internet, like me, you'll soon find yourself in their unique brand. comedy. Born of their stand up comedy trio, 'Stella', Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of a surreal comedy to display on their show, and now after they were available just download from two websites that appear in pristine glory on one DVD. Do you think comedy sketch show sans censorship, and you should be halfway there. Who likes their comedy rude, self-indulgent and bordering puerile, (and I think in the most flattering way) this is a DVD for you! I think it is worth the money for a comment from two Michaels and David alone, you can't help but love when they explain their actions, crouch on their own rumors with ex toys and back again each other on back and hurling abuse. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. It has to say something for Stella's appeal, that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to join the brave action. And you should follow their good example, throw prejudices on the wind and prepare for laughter.
