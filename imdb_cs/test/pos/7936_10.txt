I loved this movie since I saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. I last watched that I was hit by the detail I didn't notice before. Towards At the end of the picture, the killed heroes are brought back to the city through the sled. There are several details of dead men. The one who hit me the most was the shot of a blond youth. All you see on the screen is its head-to-hand profile. Hand holding flashing candle. The wind blows and its thick blond hair dances in the wind, consistent with the flickering of the candle flame. The contrast between death and lost life is incredibly strong. Moving hair and candle flame remind us of the life force that once lived in his body. Every time I get back to this movie, I see something new.
