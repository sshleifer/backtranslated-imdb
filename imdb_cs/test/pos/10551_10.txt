This is one of my favorite EVER movies ... I've seen it about a million times, and never had the opportunity to watch it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to try the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation ... does anyone know a name? If yes, please write to me !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released, and I was about Nikki's age, and for the longest time I was eavesdropping on my father to take me somewhere because I expected the same thing to happen to me! It is just such a wonderful environment and such a cute story of love-puppies. This is the ultimate DVD collector must!
