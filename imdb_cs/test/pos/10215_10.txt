Nightbreed attacked me for the first time. It has grown quite well over the years. Sets and monster work effects are some of the best I've ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this film, which I believe was at the box office at the beginning of the 1990s because of lack of interest in horror. It plays like a dark, horrible fairy tale and is much deeper, then you think, with a strong message against bigotry, represented by the rich mystical past created by Clive Barker. What sucks is the movie ends on a really cool sequel note that we'll probably never see. My only little gripe is that Craig Sheffer is at best just a moving actor and the project could benefit from a better actor. Just a minor complaint, though Sheffer's fine. I had a similar problem with Scott Bacula's illusion in Barker's Lord, not really a terrible performance, but I didn't like him in the role, just as I had other people.
