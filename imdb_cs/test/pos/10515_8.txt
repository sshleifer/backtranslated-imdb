I love the "Phantom" version of Ln Chaney, and I appreciate Webber's version only if I'm interested in the growing interest in this book, I wish I found more mysterious fracture horror with romantic aspects. I disagree with Andrew Lloyd Webber making the relationship between Raoul and Christine less restrained. Fortunately, because it's a comic short story with Eric and Christine, this version doesn't even have to bother with other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd still be waiting for another version that would match Lono's performance. I was dead wrong. But Leslie Nielson is as wonderful as Erik, of course it's a spoof. It's still great. Especially I appreciated that Erik looked more like a dead body than an accident victim. I still have Phantom than Lon. However, I do not recommend this short if you do not like spoofs. Because it is by no means to be taken seriously.
