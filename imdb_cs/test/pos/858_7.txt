When I saw this movie the first thing that jumped on me was acting Kelly Overton's young (and op and upcoming star) actress I saw for the first time completely kicked me off .. she's amazing on the screen and I'm really looking forward to what bringing her the future .... <br /> <br /> The film itself was good in the sense that it enabled Kelly Overton to do her things and take him on the road ... not much new tho I felt that I saw it all before .. but good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this phenomenon actor takes the screen storm .. I give this movie about the vote 7 ... 5 2 for the rest of the film. And on the last note .. I'm sorry for my bad English .. if it's crazy for you: P plz ignore me ...
