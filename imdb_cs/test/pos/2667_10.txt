For all those who are amazed at the length and pace of this movie ("like, why show spaceships docking like 15 minutes?"), Here's the word you could think of: <br /> <br /> Beauty . Beauty is an undervalued concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photos and so on in movies. But when was the last time you saw a movie that contains beauty purely for that? There is a strange belief among viewers that anything that is neither conspiracy nor character must be removed. This is a depressing pig. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film chart. The director can show 15 minutes of spacecraft for no reason than they are beautiful, and neither illegal nor evil. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look differently than you normally watch movies. This requires you to relax. This requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complicated chart or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, parcels and characters are good, but they're not all and the end of everything. There are different kinds of film, and in order to enjoy "2001", you have to tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, the beauty of PURE, not bound by the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "Everything is pretty useless" - Oscar Wilde.
