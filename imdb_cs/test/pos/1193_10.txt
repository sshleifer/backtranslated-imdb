This is a cult film for many reasons. First, because of the phenomenal success of the musical in both Broadway and London, then as a musical film. The film is approaching the game and some provocation games are no longer provocative twelve years later. Discrimination against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how young people from the late sixties managed to bring the political establishment down. Milo≈° Forman plays with some situations in the late 1970s as anxious justice, self-centered umbilical justice of the rich or the smallest, who have only one power more than powerless. He also plays heavily with a racial element and sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it's extremely exciting to remember those years when we had the privilege, and that wasn't a chance to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordering a mass celebration for the 1918 truce, which became an order for teachers at all levels to take their students to celebration and march, thus supporting the invasion of Cambodia that was in full swing. And some dare to give lessons from democracy abroad. I also remember the long campaign for Nixon's indictment in 1973-1974, which will eventually lead to his resignation and the oath of Gerald Ford, first vice president and ultimately president of the US, who were not elected because he was appointed Senate Vice President after Spiro Agnew he had to go to court, convictions and convictions for embezzlement. Of course, it occurred to us today, when in 2000 the US president was not elected by the people, but by the Supreme Court, or by a war that has been rejected by millions of worlds from the outset, before the start, and was launched against the UN's better judgment and three permanent members Security Council. And some talk about a new world order based on the respect of others. The modern Western man seems to have some difficulty in understanding that the world is changing and has changed widely and wisely. Modern Western man seems to be a bit unsynchronized and needs special evening hours to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is not far from this majority, and that if the Soviet bloc were to understand, that a market economy is not capitalism, but that a market economy can be either socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would fall, but vice versa, and that China has learned this lesson greatly and is at the foot of the wall to overcome to learn that their the socialist market economy must lead to political democracy, but, like Vietnam, will be able to reconstruct after thirty years of bad war aggression and injury. In other words, Hair is the perfect tool. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
