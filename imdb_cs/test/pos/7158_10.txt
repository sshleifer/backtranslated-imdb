I saw the forgiveness of the Franklin at Paramount Screening and I loved having to be honest. I really didn't want to go and I became quite tired of the movies that are being made today. Together I laughed at my ass that it was great storytelling I couldn't believe two guys shot and put the whole thing together. I thought if these guys could make such a movie with this budget, imagine what they could do with the big money behind them. And then I thought he was a tired boy, Iam, who would probably study it like that. I said that thanks to the boys I got lost and in the movie I was for a few hours to forget the world.
