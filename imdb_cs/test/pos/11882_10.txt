This movie would work much better if it was the first Critters movie, a low budget movie with only two (2) Critters displayed on the screen. Why it looks like a failure is because it's the last Critters movie and it's so low budget that the director seems to have made the whole movie with his own pocket money. But I liked this movie, I compare it mostly with the third movie (which was wrong). Critters 4 have a more serious tone, the first half of the movie (even if they don't see one Critter yet), you have a terrible feeling of watching it, it's too bad that I don't think "Critters" of "Critters" only two puppets (2) that could still use much more on the screen. Critters also have different deaths in this film, which made this a bit odd, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this section and is different in this movie that surprised me. Finally, I liked it, because it also has a conclusion to the series, so at least we won't see criticism. Oh, one last thing that I missed one scene in this movie, we never see Critter shooting from the back of the tip, Maybe these puppets don't have this feature, but I was very disappointed when I didn't see it (we see a lot of shooting in Critters 3, which was the only good thing I liked about the movie.
