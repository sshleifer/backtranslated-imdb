This film is complex and interesting in many ways. It's a constant amount of emotion and taboo. Sex and love. Women, emotional abuse of men, physical maltreatment of men, sexual abuse of children, fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied to very raw and strong blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you sit down in the first 20 minutes where you will find a tie and tweak all the characters. And the end will be more pleasant than you can expect. Music is excellent, writing is powerful and playing from everyone was brilliant. And the DVD has some great features, including the background of Samuel Jackson, who has learned to play guitar and feel the blues. This film is not meant for children and I and parents of teenagers carefully.
