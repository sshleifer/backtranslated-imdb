I saw this movie twice on the cable. When I first saw it, it surprised me. The skaters I saw were the guys we watched on the Skateboarder website in the late 1970s. They were the guys we copied and tried to stand in skating. I'm glad the movie was finally made, which provides an accurate description of how it all came about. I'm almost 40 years old and I think he's a pretty upset person with all the life problems; This movie did a great job for me. Back to the empty pools, backyard halfpipes and road trips to Cherry Hill NJ. I think you had to live this movie to really understand and appreciate it. Otherwise, it probably won't impact you. But for those of you (and you know who you are) who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! Anyway, I don't care who you are, if you have a chance to see this movie ... do it! Thanks Z-Boys of Dogtown for memories of youth and thanks to Stacy for making this movie! WORKING GOOD!
