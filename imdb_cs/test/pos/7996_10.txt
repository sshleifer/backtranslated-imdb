Forget the Revalued "Batman Begins, This Is The Ultimate Batman Movie You Won't Want To Miss. This movie has it all, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. Maybe it didn't do the same as the first at the box office, but that's definitely a much better movie , the visuals are amazing, Burton has his magic as he does in his movies once again: Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to look at. The story itself is actually pretty good and 2 villains in this one are very interesting, much more interesting In fact, the comics counterparts, Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go one step further, to give you a truly emotional connection to these Penguin characters, playing Danny Devito, is a tragic character that has left his parents at birth and later in life. trying to avenge the world that denied it, very disgusting to watch occasionally, but has some of them. The other villain is Catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives WOW performance, and totally steals the show of anything from the past and the current live action batman villain is concerned. it also has a tragic background. Her name is Selina Kyle and she is a very mysterious secretary for a smart businessman named Max Shreck who later murdered her by pushing her out the window. somehow he survives and is "awakened" by the cat and decides just then and then to become the legendary Catwoman, not earlier, of course, a wonderful succession in which he totally relaxes and destroys his entire apartment in one of the most ruthless Oscars and I've ever seen rage in an actress. Michael Keaton once again dons a cape and a cowl like Batman and also like Bruce Wayne and this time hes much darker. There is not much to say here, except that Keaton is simply the best actor ever to play Batman. He simply radiates cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. he doesn't talk much, and when he does, he sounds very good and doesn't give off his voice with the sound of all the goofy and fake IE packages "batman" the voice in batman starts. he floats around Gotham as a man possessed by his own inner demons. is pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this trip he will take 2 of the best-known baddies to give a batman comic world. I have to say that despite the amazing action scenes like the best Batmobile EVER scenes on the street and knocking the robbers to the ground and batman gliding over Gotham, his romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton, which really Makes this classic movie the best choice for anyone who wants to see REAL Batman in action. , it would be more if I could.
