Maybe I'm a good old Virginia boy in the United States of America, but this guy does it for me. The mustache will lift me up. I remember when I first saw his video. The girl he beat was amazing. The depth of his playing when he was cutting on his shabby facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite statues of our Mt. Rushmore. If I could ask him one question, would it be, "If you were a hot-dog, would you eat yourself?" Will Orhan tour? Take note of greats like Gordon Lightfoot, true heart music never goes away. Vive La John Denver. Gracias My Friend, O.F.F.L. Orhan Fan For Life
