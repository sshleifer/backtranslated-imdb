Although I am slightly older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It is a little detached from reality and it must be every little girl to become a friend with a pop star. I know it was mine to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really kitschy and the girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. Once you get over it, you can really enjoy it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really sweet and you saw how much they liked each other. The soundtrack is perfect and fits well into the movie. I also liked the family based on Jane, her sisters seemed beautiful. Very well made film.
