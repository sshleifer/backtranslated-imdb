I was looking at Linda, and that's the Top-Rate movie! The life of Paul and his wife Linda, whom he adored as a young man and eventually got married. They meet another couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four become very good friends. But their friendship takes Twisted Turn after vacation together at Varona Beach .... Twist who never returns married couples to their former status as friends. Linda is Must-See !!! ! Virginia Madsen is acceptable; however, Richard Thomas steals the film with its incredible acting ... and the emotions it displays. <br /> <br /> Wonderful Movie! "Lotta Honey"
