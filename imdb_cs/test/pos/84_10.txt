Very good movie, focused on a very important matter. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious and preventable defect. If more families saw this film, maybe more children would end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of her best roles at all. This is an excellent film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike the thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children fighting this world. A really important point is that it could be prevented. More people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously. It's well done, with important news, handled in a graceful way.
