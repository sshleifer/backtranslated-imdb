A very good "Precoder" starring Dick Barthelmess, who reminded me in some way of the Hawks "Only Andels Have Wings" (1939), which also featured Barthelmess. This film was directed by master William Wellman, who was responsible for the pioneer Silent picture "Wings". Barthelmess plays a pilot who is blamed for an airplane in the air. He then meets and falls on the nice Sally Eilers, who participates as part of the law in the wandering Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears in the scene, a triangular relationship follows. "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some moving and touching scenes, also thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (who, in my opinion, resembles very much in this movie actress Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good as a Barthelmess brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying pieces, fast-moving movie; in all, very fun. Don't miss it when TCM sends it again.
