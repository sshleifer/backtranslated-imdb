The last and eighth film of Hayao Miyazaki for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is a wonderfully entertaining and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when movie animation seems to be dominated by Disney / Pixar CGI masterpieces, it's both refreshing and reassuring to know that Miyazaki still relies on a traditional hand drawn animation to tell her charming and charming stories. The story revolves around a friendship between a magical sea sprite / goldfish and a human child encountered during a curious trip to see the world of men. A human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small cliff house overlooking a small port town in southern Japan (based on Seto Island), where he lives with his young mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke appoints the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes her to the childcare / nursing center where Lisa works. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and will soon begin to adapt and take on human aspects (developing human speech and appetite for ham meat) by taking blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. Yet, as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken back by her father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who is a former man who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develop magic elixirs from the sea to help him repair and rejuvenate the world's oceans. Pony's desire to become a man has become so strong that Fujimoto can no longer hold it and take on more human looks and breaks from her water world home and goes back to see Sosuke. During her escape, Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's cache of magic elixirs, which releases all sorts of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding Sosuke. Desperately wanted to resolve Pony's rebellion, he soon calls for the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's Mother - Water Elemental, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). As with previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" touches on different topics of ecology and ecology, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is occasionally sober when Ponyo meets a drunken vessel that scratches the ocean floor, uncovering the mountains of rubbish and debris. It is possible to understand the anger and frustration of Fujimot's character, who has spent his entire life trying to correct the damage civilization is making to its oceans, yet it is a daunting and almost barren endeavor. to say about the remarkable animation in this movie. This is sometimes bizarre and outrageous, but charming and curious. Miyazaki wanted to capture the meaning and style of children's fantasy. The art style has the appearance of crayons / pencil drawings and is beautifully colored and fantastic. It's almost like a child's colorful book comes to life. Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job like Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring their charm to their roles. In particular, Nara Yuria sounds so damn cute as Ponyo, no wonder Doi's Sosuke falls into a magical girl. The former campaign girl / model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as Sosuke's modern mother, Lisa. At first I was a bit confused by my character when I originally thought it was Sosuke's older sister. It also did not help that Sosuke kept referring to her as "Lisa" rather than mom but I think it is perhaps a sign of times and an indicator of modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to names). The 1980s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different than serious Fujimoto, but wisely does not mean that his character sounds a sound of a rogue or rogue threat. While his character is no longer known, former baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who portrays Sosuke's father Koichi) also brings nice voice work. Introductory theme "Umi No Okasan" Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is just beautiful and mixing. In contrast to Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" theme is light and fun and evokes images of traditional Japanese maternal rhyme. During one brilliant sequence, the soundtrack releases an almost wagner-like opera sound with music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". However, the film is not perfect and suffers moments when the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a seat back to some Miyazaki stunning fantastic visuals. I also wanted us to have more time to explore Fujimoto's back story, as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father. Like "Kiki's Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is another Miyazaki classic that is a wonderful feast for the eyes. As well as a modern fairy tale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that you will surely appreciate in the years to come.
