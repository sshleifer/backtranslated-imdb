This film is cheerful, bright and bright. Although the story would work well and include almost any ethnic group, the natural Jewish nature of the characters gives greater importance to the reward of a wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues on the plot that it would be worth seeing for this reason; - but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread to a versatile audience. The idea of ​​complex characters, with its various strengths and weaknesses, plays a role with all the pathos and humor that one might expect from Shakespeare's drama. This is a family movie; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible linkage of diverse personalities and lifestyles, first between siblings and parents and inevitably between a larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a speed and development that keeps the viewer interested until the final scene. Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in his patriarch Morris Applebaum family. Strong casting performances include a surprising guest. Don't miss this movie!
