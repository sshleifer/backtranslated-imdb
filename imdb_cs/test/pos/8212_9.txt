When this film firt came out in 1995, I found it great. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After watching her brilliant performance in Speed, I was ready to enjoy some of her movies. <br /> <br /> Back to Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspension. All in all, I liked it, so I put **** from *****.
