For years I remembered the song "JUST A COUPLE IN CASTLE" ("Just A Few In The Air"). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered it had to do with the bugs. I've found a link to a movie on the web. I saw a movie when I was only 9 years old at Ligonier PA Theater. I was pleased to find out that it was Kenny Gardner's singer with Guy Lombar (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then see that it was made by Fleisher Bros, who made another very good full length cartoon feature of "Gullivar's Travels" (also remembered kindly). Also songs were associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, who are among the best. No wonder I remembered film, song, and animated animation. As a full-fledged musical, it is a film that should be remembered as one of the best musicals in its entirety. Now that I remember that the storyline doesn't have to be an earthquake but it was very well presented and makes for an easy to follow abd wonderful movie.
