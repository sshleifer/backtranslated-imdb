What a good movie! Unfortunately, in 1947, the screenplay could not follow the book from which it was edited, but homosexual murder would be too hot to handle at the time. I thought all the performances were excellent, as well as the script, directing, brilliant black and white cinematography, music and the noira film atmosphere. I understand that in 1947 the film could not portray racism against blacks or prejudices against homosexuals. (Robert Young's prejudice against his grandfather, who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago, was lame enough, but times dictated that the film would avoid further investigation of racism.) <br /> <br /> I have one observation and one question for the viewer: 1. Have you noticed that Robert Young did not target his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan, who ran fast in the dark and Young shot from the top window window into the dark without aiming? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and the young was 40 years old, the timeline would not be logical. If grandfather were killed 50 years ago, then the timeframe would be realistic.
