I really love action / adventure movies and that's one of the best. Of course we like the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others, but his story that really counts. The best is somewhat feasible, but we can tolerate those that are a bit "over the top" like in the style of a comic book action. The more twists and turns, the more horrible situations the heroes are involved in, and the more shocking moments in the film; The more they like action / adventure fans. "In the Line of Fire" has all the elements needed for a rip-roaring action thriller. He has Clint Eastwood as a secret service agent approaching retirement. It has one of the most evil, despicable, manic villains in John Malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, "get his due". He has Rene Russo as a "love interest". It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is very well managed by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a great Ennio Morricone. This one is a true rollercoaster ride of a thriller! Don't miss it!
