This movie was good. It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie over and over and not make it. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were amazing as Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love those guys! I also love the adventures they've continued. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Music in this movie is amazing! I love singing with all the songs!
