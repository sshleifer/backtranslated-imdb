"7" is not necessarily a smudge - this was a low budget movie - but it did well within its limits. The usual cauldron chart - a ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and a prisoner escape in pods, land on an unknown planet where their presence awakens. Mayhem follows, a lot of ammunition is spent. The special effects were replacement and properly designed, with an emphasis on future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap looking plastic props. In addition, the stimulation of the story moved without the viewer getting into boredom, where they began to collect things separately. You can get up and hit the fridge without stopping it and it will still be nice. Better yet, your girlfriend can talk all the way without damaging your pleasure - and she'll be happy: after all, she got to you! It's the THAT type of movie. Anyway, the real story line has several holes after it hit the planet, but hey, that's Guns 'n' Ammo action movie. Cohesive storylines are not necessarily necessary if you have beer and chips at hand. So don't let yourself get into the brain cramp over the end.
