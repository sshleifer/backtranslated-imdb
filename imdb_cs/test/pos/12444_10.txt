I can't remember where I first heard about them, but I listen to a little song and I like it. He went and bought a cd and finally found the type of music I like. I heard about this video and I knew I had to have it. He has a lot of clips of them playing in concert. Let me tell you that this video is not even compared to them. I saw them twice at a concert and I don't want to miss the chance to see them again. Two other things he has is some conversation and even a video for one of their biggest songs. a few small side notes ... I saw them on ozzfest 2001 and ruled there, but seeing them in the smaller inner stage was much better (they had some really cool things to cut out the lights) others, in case someone wonders , means that the voter means a devoted follower.
