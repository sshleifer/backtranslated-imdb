This is an important historical film because it was the first feature film. The film was made for just $ 23,000. Over a million dollars have been released for its release. This film helped to define the gangster melodramas that were to become bread and butter in Warner's studio in the 1930s. The popularity of this film has put an end to the silent era more than its more famous predecessor, the jazz singer. The film deserves its place in history and not just a footnote. The only actor who remembers today was Eugene Palette.
