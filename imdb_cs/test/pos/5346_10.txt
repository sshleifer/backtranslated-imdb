This movie is what most industry has forgotten how to make: FAMILY fun, which means something that is enjoyable for people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can enjoy everyone from toddlers who love colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the links to adults. <br /> <br /> This film has a good direction I have ever seen, and I mean it literally. It is also packed with tiny pieces of humor, and each scene has so many humorous background details that I will have to buy if only to read all the brands and handbills in the W&G world. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie at least twice in theaters, then buy it on DVD. You should see it, too.
