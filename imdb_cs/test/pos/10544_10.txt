Initially, it seems that the current romance movie, where the girl meets the boy and fall in love, but the point is that this film feels that others do not. I had to leave. But when I walked along I thought I had to see it again, but I didn't have the opportunity until that time. It once, twice ... up to 200 times and not kidding. I knew all the hart dialogues and I don't know why, but I saw it every day and never get bored. The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because I think she can do it. , this is a movie I can't rip out of my mind.
