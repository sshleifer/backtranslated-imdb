The biggest problem with the TV program Key West was that it was advertised badly. If you've seen ads, you should think that this was a trembling way, and be very disappointed. It was a much more complicated show than that. By chance I found myself in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew intervened, and I think I actually came for a drink or two with some of the cast in Rum Runners. Of course it was before the hit. I saw a sailboat that was several times and talked to a guy you saw coconut hacking. He was a real local. Yes, I'd like to see it on DVD.
