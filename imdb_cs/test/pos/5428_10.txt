This is a masterpiece. "The Big Snit" is a crazy, weird, hilarious, and finally touching look at an old married couple and their quiet life, arguing about filing and scrabble, while nuclear war rages outside. Everything in this great animated short show is so unforgettable: The Eye of a Shivering Wife, Vacuuming, Husband's Vision Fetish (Beware of These Backgrounds!), Very Verbal Cat, Demented Game Show, "Informative" Anchor News "accordion serenade and moving and unforgettable end. I'm so glad I found 'The Big Snit', which is one of the biggest movies ever made.
