This film deserves 10 that I give. But it's not 10 that you would give movies like 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the type 10 you give to a movie that just makes you laugh again and again! It is the worst written and directing film, yet he does not have fun. It has the most amateur effects, yet you like every moment! I saw this movie on TV today and I didn't want to give up! Read the following dialog to know why! <br /> <br /> (The whole school is around Manisha who has just been raped and the guys who tried to rape ask for forgiveness) Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad Guy 2: Yes, we won't do it again. <br /> <br /> (No reply from Manisha) Akshay: Come on, forgive them! Manisha: I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman, and even dead people can be excited about you! And these are live young men! Don't blame them! Pancholi: Jo Manisha .. Manisha (To Suniel): What if they tried to rape your girlfriend ??? Suniel: I would break their hands, feet and kill them. But I will forgive them anyway .. Akshay: Yeah, if you don't forgive them then, you would be too arrogant about your beauty! Now it's a true masterpiece of dialogue! This movie will never be entertained, mainly because there are so many goofy and unreal situations! A bad man (Munish) can basically do anything. He can blow a sand storm out of his mouth, or he can take a motorcycle from the back and just as easily disappear. Each actor turns to speak .. One line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. It is the main rule followed by the director, so every person is given the same time on screen. And then there's a powerful pendant that can make a speed car go straight through you without being hurt! All these things make it a fun movie and I can watch it again and again. I think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one. The only problem is that it wasn't trying to be funny.
