If I could only watch one program in my entire life, I would definitely have to choose "The Chaser's War on Everything". Of all the satirical shows that were on Australian television, I found that "Chaser" is the funniest of all. It's just amazing, boys aren't afraid to do anything. Whether he dresses like Hitler to get to a Polish club, or pushed the MASSIVE ball chain around Melbourne to try out tourist ads or rock to the Coke factory naked in the bathtub with $ 2.40 to buy a little water. Chaser guys go there. According to the above comments (and / or below) "The Chaser's War on Everything" is more popular than their previous program "CNNNN". But CNNNN was just as fun. Some unforgettable moments from this show ... Clean Cambodia !!! Classical. So anyway, to stop me from Ranting, I suggest you at least give Chaser a chance, more than likely to find that HILARIOUS !!!!
