At first glance this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston didn't come back. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey have made laudable works replacing the very important characters for the ongoing saga of this legendary Epic Western. Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy and Louis Gossett Jr. he was, as always, true to form with his outstanding acting skills. The drama that seemed to be true in many scenes, including one of the best where the brave shoot-out ended up with Ranger Walker who was killed so I felt I was actually in film. Returning to Lonesome Dove was for me, almost up to the quality of the first series. The next 2 sequels with James Garner as Call just didn't do it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How come the hell happened? That was the overall mismatch of the characters. The first 2 series of the epic story, the other 2 in no way were of the same quality. Now, if the first two could be remastered in Dolby Digital and Anamorphic presentations, the movies could be where they should be like movies of today.
