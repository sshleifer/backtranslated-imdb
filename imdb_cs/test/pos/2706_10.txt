Being a passionate Carpenter Fan, I really loved this movie (although wigs leave a lot on demand!) And I agree with many comments that certain areas of her life were missing or not touching. Anything - Leaves your curiosity well and truly dissatisfied, so I appeared more. I have to recommend Ray Coleman's book - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is intelligent and unlike the film, it is "real" and down on the ground. I hope you like it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days at Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) in her own right and I think it was the edge needed to create a character. Some other actresses were fighting it. It is a shame that the film could not be delved deeper into her story. After all, it is a movie title, but I felt that we had learned more about Richard, but I suppose that like any artist who is worth their salt, you should always want more!
