The theme of the film is inspiring and very real. It happened. One can discuss some artistic freedoms interested in the director and screenwriter. The subject is what makes the movie tick - nothing else. I saw the film for the first time after real Phoolan, was shot in New Delhi and served for several years as an elected MP in India. Incidentally, the first untouchable was not elected to parliament, as some reviewers have said. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in dedicated constituencies. While Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero of many India, he has created commercially accepted international films - - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerant children's film called "Mister India", adopted by average Indian viewers) - and even nominations for Oscar for Elizabeth, I don't have him as a film director at India. In all departments he fails as a director, except that he manages to gain the above-average performances of his actors. It is not easy to find subtlety, subtlety, magic in his films - he leaves the melodrama in them. His idea to use the vocal rendition of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's song in the early days of the film, perhaps his only major achievement on the undistinguished soundtrack "Bandit Queen". And then maybe the creaking door during the gang rape sequence. Otherwise, the film looked like western spaghetti with sex and violence, minus great music with which one is connected. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good living Indian film director who makes a realistic international cinema - you shouldn't see Shekhara Kapur movies; it is the later work of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen, and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Ali is "Umrao Jaan". It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support Kapur and their films had to provide them with an international audience. For example, Sen's "The Eye of Oorie Katha" made in Telugu, or Satyajit Ray's "Sadgati" based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan" are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing with the state of untouchables in India. Dream did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence, but merely suggested. Of course, Sen's nugget did not create headlines, while Kapur's effort bound them. Kapur's merit is to articulate and use his limited talent and modest resources in the film industry in Mumbai to take his products beyond his home. viewers. Because of this effort, I greet Kapura. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a great topic waiting for a perfect director to deal with him.
