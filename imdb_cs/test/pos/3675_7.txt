This is one of the strangest movies I've been watching for a long time. Usually, if they are strange, I pour out early and rarely regret. Fortunately, I kept this. Although I can't say it's a great movie (it's not), I can say that watching it is more like a good sour trip - just a few really horrible moments and the rest filled with "I really saw that?" astonishment. Lots of laughter out loud. Great cast of characters with Meredith Eaton as a dwarf daughter-in-law with attitude. Keep your mind open.
