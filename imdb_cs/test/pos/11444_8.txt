I saw the "Night of Demons 2" before I saw the "Night of Demons". Unfortunately, my old blockbuster thought it was good to have a sequel, but not a first one. Looney, huh? I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd better have a Facotory Cheesecake (or any more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can't help but just want cheap things. Demon's Night has everything: your innocent, sexy, chick-dee, your token, which surprisingly didn't kill. You are a slutty girl, you are a slimy guy, you are a dark girl or a guy, a goofy ball, a cheesy setting of a haunted house, bad dealings and lots of useless nudity. Isn't this great? I know deep in the heart of the movies that it was bad enough, but it was good for horror movies. Horror fans should enjoy and kick! <br /> <br /> 8/10
