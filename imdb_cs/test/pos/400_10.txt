A very adorable movie that should have a wider distribution. Ian McShane is home, playing a DJ loving the soul that gets into the can because he won't be with the program and wants to let the world know what's missing. The support cast is also great and the music is a "Soul" movie. I just wish the movie was released so I could get a copy for my movie library.
