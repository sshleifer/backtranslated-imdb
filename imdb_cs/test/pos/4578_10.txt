I love money! Last week I came across this great movie in a local video store. There was no certainty what to expect. He brought him home, set up players, and then my journey to stupidity began. First browsing I did a lot of laughter, no laugh aloud really. It wasn't until the second viewing of the movie really started to stick to me and the humor was that much more fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers when I first saw that it was okay, then there was real fun. I'm doing all my friends watching this movie, everyone knows. This movie may well be one of the most accurate "Future" movies ever made. This movie is more than 84 minutes of fun, it's a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that brought us Office Space, brought us a vision of life in an automated future. Luke Wilson's dead lord humor as "moderate" Joe improved the film that much more. Watch this movie once you're done, read more! WRITE MORE! THINK MORE! For futures, if not for your own!
