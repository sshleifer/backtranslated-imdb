Mikio Naruse examines the lives of three still, complaining, the only former geisha in post-war Japan's amazing character. They used to be friends in ancient times, but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful lover and the other two owe her. Though he is the only one to be successful in this rebuilding, he is the only one out of three who has no children. The other two have a child on whom they depend, because none of them work. Complications arise when children choose to marry (though not each other) and leave home. This leads to bitter, mumbling old women to become even more bitter and mumbling, drunk and mourning their rotten children and the unmatched friend of moneylender. Meanwhile, Valentine himself is unhappy, despite his wealth. Except for his young deaf maid, no one keeps his company, and a random encounter with two former lovers from her geisha days doesn't go anywhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. All three characters are deep in the fast sand of their own boring lives and are too tired to fight a lot. other. "Late Chrysanthemums" is very slow and it won't happen, but Naruse, like all the great directors, has the ability to do with very little. I haven't seen much of his work, but I suspect it's not his best, though it's very good. I think the problem is, it's not all that much. But the film is full of good points. Though it's cynical, it's not that much. Naruse seems to be sympathetic to his desperate characters and paints live portraits that make the characters appear somewhat noble in their misery. While the film is not a necessity to see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known director (outside his own country) whose rare one is available on video here in the US.
