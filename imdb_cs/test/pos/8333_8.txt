In World War II, America developed a completely new HUGE Bomber. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are going to cover the story when the plane goes on its first mission. Lois puts it down on the plane before it starts. There are also some Japanese saboteurs on board who intend to fly a bomber to Tokyo. Will Lois be able to warn Superman? What do you think? Fast moving, colorful cartoon. The animation is a bit jerky, but much better than what we see today. Color and sound have been beautifully restored. Only two problems - poor music and racism (especially in the title). That's pretty good. 8.
