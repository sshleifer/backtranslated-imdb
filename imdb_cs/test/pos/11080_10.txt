Falcon and Snowman are based on the true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee (titular traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their KGB code names. Why? Boyce was a passionate falconer, and Lee was a coke head. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what is their motivation? It is not disillusionment. It is not ideology. (Sorry my bad grammar,) but I'm doing it. What was it when it was not disillusionment or ideology? In a word, greed. At the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money became a great motivator and not an ideology. Do not believe me? Then check out the Walker Family Spy Ring, which was broken in the late 1980s. Three spies have done the worst damage to our national security in the 1970s and 1980s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 1960s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee. The three sold this land for thirty pieces of silver. If you're not familiar with this phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
