At first I couldn't tell if it was an art movie or a documentary. The day after I had a unique film after taste or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human effort to destroy everything that exists, including life on Earth. Lead is clueless and cold. He is like any of us, wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and have fun. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive, just to make time and entertain. It's too late to finish. Since my first visit to the United States, I have grown up as a dream, where life on Earth is nothing but a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist, and I have communicated this film to my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of instability. This may sound strange, but in some way this film has touched me in a profound way, like no other. I recommend it.
