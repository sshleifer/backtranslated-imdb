William M. Thackeray once said, "Good laughter is the sun in the house." When I watched Take Away, I must say that the sun was shining in my house. This film was great, the opening was very clever, the story held together, two fish'n chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance to engage in the struggle of David and Goliath against rapid combat. the food chain that builds a street restaurant. The end was cheerful, though I found many people who disagree with me. Although the film was very discreet, it displayed contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, especially the collision or clash of culture, if you were among them. the traditional Australian and Anglo-Saxon Australian stereotypes of Anglo, and how they have found a kind of "unity, even adversity," very nice. I found Vince Colosima as "Tony Stilano" Italo-Australian Fish 'n The owner of a chip shop at the age of thirty is top-notch, his acting performances are very original and convincing; Surface essence, or I should tell the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which is actually not too Italian, but neither too Australian, Colosimo found that balance, inhaled into the lungs and gave her life. Cinematography could have been better, more local shots would be nice, what I see was in Melbourne, but where in Melbourne? for me it looks somewhere between Ivanho and Bullen, even though I'm not 100% sure. I don't know why so many people compare this movie to "The Castle" have similar themes running over them, Take Away stands in its own league. I think the movie was excellent with the capital "E" having it all, it's funny, jokes are great, dealing with the current challenges facing Australian society, the story keeps up well, I loved it! I warmly recommend.
