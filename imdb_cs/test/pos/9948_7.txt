If you like Japanese monster movies, you will love this action packed battle to build alien invaders, intent on conquering the Earth, and "giant robot" with super weapon armor. The alien, "Emporer Guillotine", from Gargoyle, has an army of criminals called "(of course)" a gargoyle gang, as well as an endless supply of enormous enemy creatures that are commonly released on Earth to break buildings. , give loud noises, panic people, etc. A small child, named Johnny Sokko, has a giant robot in his call and sends the robot as needed to defeat, and then blast these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn and tries to save the world. Despite the camp, inadvertently witty dialogue and the fact that the target audience was clearly children, this film has non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and just happens to be fun to watch. Battle scenes are well done and frequent as the storyline requires. Good guys and bad guys made sure they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition, and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film was made from edited episodes of the TV series, the storyline evolves and reaches the final conclusion. The film has a positive outlook and appeals to everyone (especially children) the desire to destroy evil in many of its forms. Children can be a target audience, but it is fun for everyone to laugh at his comic stupidity; but at the same time the root of good guys to win and save the world. Acting is cheesy in places, but it is a spell: there are several lines of conical dialogue (maybe mistakes in translation or perhaps deliberate jokes by filmmakers) and later you will find that you are quoting these absurd lines. It is true that this film does not have high quality or budget. However, for what it is, campy science fiction, it's nice for some laughter. I recommend it to anyone who has such a sense of humor.
