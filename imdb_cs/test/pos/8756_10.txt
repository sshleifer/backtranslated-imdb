Traffik is a really well done 6 hour drug drama (circa 1987). He tells in parallel three stories about how opium is cultivated in northeastern Pakistan, how drugs are smuggled from Pakistan to Europe, and finally how people are addicted to drugs that are out of control. All three stories are narrated realistically and with empathy. You see enough lives of characters to understand how ordinary people can get into life that is really immoral. <br /> <br /> These are not cardboard board cutouts, the opium grower is trying to feed his family. a dry area full of weapons and other opium growers. A drug smuggler is a wealthy German without a heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is just an ordinary woman, who has to choose between leading her life "old way" or giving up. Finally, the main character, the government minister, has the most difficult role, because he has to deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. He slips into the world of drug addiction and begins to steal, suffer from a bad health, emotionally attack his parents, so that he can continue to satisfy his desire for a drug (heroin) that destroys her life. Traffik is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes in this show will stay with you long, long. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
