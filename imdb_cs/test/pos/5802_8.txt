I have to admit that when she first saw Madonna showing off Holiday on Top of Pops many years ago, I told my wife that "another American hit to get right!" Well, she was wearing a haunted wig and she was terribly dressed. I have never grown it as my daughter does, but I have to eat my words. I like some of her stuff and sometimes I enjoy movie concerts. This Confessions tour is great, though music is not (and is not). I was impressed with productions and concepts. Madonna's own performance was reinforced by incredible dancers she decided to support. My daughter was at London concerts and was crazy about it. Ms. (Madge) has shown her very first evaluation of her very badly!
