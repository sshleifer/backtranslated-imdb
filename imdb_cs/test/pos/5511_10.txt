I didn't think this movie was bad. Sure, the detective sucked in a little what he did, and it usually happened on Capt. Captain, as he was scary enough. The makeup artist did a great job. I really liked seeing Dee dressed up for all the geeky. When I saw it, I laughed so hard. Personally, I don't see anyone sitting in stupid things like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre massacre and saying it a great movie, and then watching Strangeland, which is more worrying because much of it could become so popular with the internet and call it bad. I personally think the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a lot of crap. Probably one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie because almost everything is really happening.
