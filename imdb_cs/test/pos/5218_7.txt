Facing a mid-life crisis and suffering from his marriage to Cindy, Teddi Siddall, who seemed to have a bigger say in what he was doing, and where the Air Force remained, the elite elite Red Beret Sgt. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided one morning to leave everything and start a new life as a civilian. David first got this idea when he met at Halloween party sweet and adoring Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his secret in the background from her by telling Alyson that he was in a secret military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside Austin Tex David starts exploring the possibilities of his life with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from her. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once and makes a date with her. Before you know it, David, who now uses the name Haywood, is busy getting married to her. He pretended that his death in a bicycle accident Dave intentionally left his wife and children in the winter and left his army It didn't take long for Dave to learn that civilian life was not appealing to him. It is too late for Dave to return to his first wife, Cindy, and his two boys, who he faces a brig, and a military military court if he returns to the USAF. Dave occupies the only job he can do to help him and Alyson and their son Chris: using their skills he learned in Red Berets to rob banks. Based on the true story of "Lies He Said" has Dave Bay / Haywood living three, not two, different lives. "One of the hard-working family men, one as a ruthless bank robber and one more as dead and Highly decorated, by the President of the United States and Prime Minister GB, by the American hero, Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt David Bay and husband David Haywood. he got a stupid man to the point where he wanted to get lost and away from her, but he was looking for expert advice from the US Air Force that he would rather give him instead of choosing an easy way out, which leads him directly to Levenworth Ferderal Prison. Maybe it was that too macho Dave thought it would be a bad sign on his career as well as his ego to get help for his problems. Illas as Alyson is the glue that keeps the film along with her during the first pass along with the new spouses explaining his frequent disappearances, some up to two weeks when doing a secret action that keeps the country safe from both domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of taking care of the banker in planing and robbing. Which was the only way he knew how to make a living from what he had learned in subversive actions, all those years in elite berets. Alyson watched Dave's mother Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson), who told her he was dead because he was a little boy, in Portland he finds out the truth about a double or triple life he leads because he married her. This led to Alyson becoming aware of his marriage to Linda and the two sons he had with her, as well as his fake death and now AWOL of the USAF. Being that this is the real story ending was anything you should guess is in standard Hollywood, or made for television, film. That's what the movie "Lies He, much better than what you would expect."
