A beautiful film in 1962 in Hong Kong about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their husbands have an affair. Stylically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on body parts (legs, hands, waist). The film itself has restraint and accuracy that indicates its time period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the audience to see how the husbands look, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even created to look elegant with detailed smoke curls. Really beautiful movie. Just prepare for the end. <br /> <br />
