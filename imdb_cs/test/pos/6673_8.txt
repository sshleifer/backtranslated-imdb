If you like movies that will make you think, it's one of the good ones. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality films. Iain Softley has greatly directed K-PAX. The film has tears in the feelings and philosophy of mind and world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both provide excellent acting skills. It caught me, I didn't take the screen out during the movie. On the other hand, if you hope for a special sci-fi movie, it's not for you. The story is a bit tugged, which can be a bit boring, but it also acts as a way to create a movie theme. </p> <p>
