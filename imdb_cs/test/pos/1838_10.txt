Returning to me is a charming gem of the film. With a stellar cast that can go wrong with this modern fairy tale? It also includes many, many jokes written by the humorous girl Bonnie Hunt herself who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different attitude than his mundane alter-ego mulder on my favorite show x-files. great date movie!
