Since watching the DVD in "The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea" DVD, I felt that this movie would be great because I'm a huge Disney fan. And guess what? Am I right! This film is a very good successor to the original classic "Lady and Tramp". It tells the story of Scampa, Lady and Tramp's mischievous son, Scamp, who wants to be a wild and free life place for a housedog. Although the film may not be as good as the first one, it has a great morale that you have not found anywhere else until you notice it. I admit that the film is not for everyone, but those of you who hate it all I can say is that you do not have a ghost and I suggest you not see it again. But hey! It's a really amazing story, full of brilliant animation, music and stellar voice talents featuring Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you haven't seen the movie, why is it there? Go and grab a copy !!!
