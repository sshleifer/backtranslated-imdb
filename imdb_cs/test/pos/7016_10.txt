I first heard of this film from a friend. She loved him and always watched. When she told me about it and said how old it was, I immediately decided I wouldn't like it. I was so bad. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing movie! I love music and dance. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD right after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were great at it. So well captured the emotions and feelings of the characters. They were both good dancers. After watching the movie I wished, I could dance like them and hope to play the ballroom and Latin dance soon. I became a fan of this kind of dance and now I am dependent on all the movies and programs about it. Dirty Dancing revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite part of the movie is when a child gets to the staff headquarters and sees them dancing and of course the last scene where they and Johnny dance together before everyone. I believe everyone must watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their lives. If not, it's their loss !!
