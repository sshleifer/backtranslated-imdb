I just saw this movie in a sneaky look and before reading your comment you have to know it's very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, House and music like that. The film deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or any of his name) died in an accident: he fell off the roof, "drunk". Carl meets his brother's girlfriend Sunny, and both of them are quite unmotivated to some private investigation into Jason's death, and Carl joins Jason's former life, which was filled with clubs and drugs. The film itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a big pile with ** t. The story is predictable, all characters are extremely clich√© and two-dimensional (a stupid little town boy, a young pretty innocent girl, a great bad drug king ... list it is infinite) and most actors like conspiracy are not just plausible. Matthew Rhys's performance of a stupid boy coming to Great London and the sudden use of drugs from people he doesn't even know seems to be too trustworthy, unlike his female Sunny counterpart, Sienna Guillory, whose behavior is more realistic to the viewer. Nothing more than a joke was Tim Curry's performance of drug king Damian: a fake cartoon, too "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true. BUT: If you like club music (club scenes) eg selected songs are simply brilliant), if you enjoy simple lovestory with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes, I admit, I lost my heart;). It makes my comment even more subjective, I think) with some (predictable) twists and turns you will definitely enjoy this movie. Anyone else: BACK .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal opinion as well as my final vote)
