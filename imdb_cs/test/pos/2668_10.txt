Sometimes reading IMDB user comments fills me with despair for this kind. For anyone who would reject 2001: Space Odyssey as "boring", they must not be interested in science, technology, philosophy, history, or the art of filmmaking. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and empty - they understand their audience. Fortunately, those who cannot appreciate Kubrick's success are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and pure virtuosity that came into making this epic. This is a movie that put science into "science fiction", and its depiction of the cosmic paths and the future of mankind remains unsurpassed to this day. That was so far ahead of his time that humanity had not yet been captured. 2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow and full of trivia is that the goal was to realistically imagine the future of technology (and the past, respecting the inspiring opening scene). The greatest strength of the film is in the details. Remember, when this movie was made, you haven't reached the moon yet ... but it's in 2001, and that's just the beginning of the journey. If you want to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have, it is beyond faith - I still can't figure out how some of the shots were made. The only remarkable mistake in the film was the optimism with which it predicted the technological (and social) development of mankind. It is a pity for us that 2001 did not look like a 2001 film, not Kubrick's. In addition to the incredible special effects, working with the camera and stage design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with plenty of food thinking about what it means to be human and where the human race goes. Yes, the end is strange and hard to understand - but that is the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke began to anticipate the task, now it is up to the audience to continue. There is no neat resolution, no definite stop sign, because viewers can stop thinking about the last reel. I know what most viewers want these days, but Kubrick won't let us turn it off so easily. I'm glad that this movie is in the 100 best IMDB movies, and just wished it was even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the most beautiful filmmakers in the world and his best success in 2001. 10/10.
