In the history of the film, every great filmmaker had to create his first film. Many times, when we look after the success, the light bulb in our heads shines. The connection is made and we see a solid foundation from where they started. So this is with HORSES ON MARS. It is a subtle humor woven around a seemingly straightforward story that tells a great story, but also allows you to enjoy visual images simultaneously. In the paintings I found great attention to detail and production cushion, which is rare in every student film. Young filmmaker always has improvements. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will look at this film once as a beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.
