Joy from the beginning to the end. If you don't like the Muppets, then I just have to apologize. This amazing movie isn't just the cash in popularity of Muppets' - it's a well-conceived and well-written movie in its own right. He has great songs and it has a thread of wise melancholy that has always been present in Jim Henson's creations and which is most embodied in the character of Kermit Frog. I've always responded to it as a child, and that's what makes the muppets fun for me as adults when I have gone crazy with other child-centered material. The huge cast of big names appearing in portraits makes this movie feel like the version of "Around the World in 80 Days", which is childish, except it's about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Level: A
