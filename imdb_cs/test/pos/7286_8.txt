It's very difficult to find a good horror movie anymore, he thought this movie was a good thriller. I had real bookings before I saw this movie (due to cover). I was afraid it would be too bloody and bloody. I was wrong. Although there are a lot of scary parts, there's a lot of tension and drama. Expect from micro budget horror flick. The characters were credible <br /> <br /> The movie is really exciting and quite scary in moments, so it does catch your spot until the end of the credits roll <br /> <br /> Due to its production value (the sound is not very good) 8/10.
