This is not a movie I would typically watch at 2:30 in the morning, but I got into it and I couldn't stop until it was over. Shia LaBeouf has shown that he is not just a young actor, but could handle more challenging roles. The fact that he has been given these roles over the past two years is a testament to his ability. It was really his movie. Sure, there were others involved, but they pale in comparison to his role. <br /> <br /> This was the time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it to the masses, much as Tiger Woods opened golf to all races. As Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) told Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): "... if Mr. Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it's because he's the best because he's the one who is not his father, not how much money he has, because who is bloody! Go charge.
