I caught this movie at night on one of the movie channels and I didn't laugh long. This movie was so funny that I went out and bought myself the next day. I love this type of comedy. It seemed as real as actors react to different situations. I was Rollin. I've never heard of it and just started watching for the title of "Other People's Vision". The title caused me to do it and I'm glad I did it. I laughed so hard it hurts. Now it's part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to everyone who enjoys a smart type of comedy. I'll watch this over and over again.
