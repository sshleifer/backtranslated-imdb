I saw this movie the day he opened in New York, Ziegfield. At that time, Madonna was not a cultural icon now. She had a few hits, she was very good at "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in a gig at the Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who's the girl?" it gives Madonna a real role, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She works with madcap / heroine better than you think. Griffin Dunne is very well cast as a man around to witness all shenanigans. The story includes a giant cat named Murray, the bride-to-be who slept with every taxi driver in New York. father-in-law and key. There's a lot of car chases and cops watching their way. All elements of the comics game intact. Sir John Mills is briefly seen. He shares a glass of champagne with the leaders and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with rainforest and everything. <br /> <br /> It's fantastic compared to most Madonna movies (the ones I could tolerate anyway). It is not so bad in itself. 6/10. PS The concert was lousy.
