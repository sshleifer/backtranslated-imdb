10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies ever made, and I'm not saying I'm confused by a seemingly pointless presentation. Those who do not like the film because they do not understand this story, often criticize those who praise the film by claiming that their genius assumes it because they do not understand it. I don't see this film as very allegorical. For me, it's a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. People are confused with the film because they expect to have a profound, philosophical meaning to interpret from the supposedly insignificant scenes. I feel they don't realize that mystery comes from a chopped and rearranged conspiracy combined with a very long and rather explanatory sequence of fantasy and not from the chaos of a visual allegory. To limit the length, I will try to keep this short and in place and touch the main concepts. General Conspiracy: Diane moves to L.A. She meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane is angry with jealousy because Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers a second man (director) on film shooting and reveals another woman (random blonde) to engage with Camille and the director. Motivated by her anger and obsession, Diane hires a man to kill Camille. After it happens, it is overcome by loneliness and slips into the unconscious world of fantasy where the life it wants lives. Diane then wakes up. In her conscious state, she is persecuted by what she has done. The Importance of Fantasy: The film begins, with credits, with the first person p.o.v. shot depicting someone who collapses on the bed and slips into unconsciousness. This is where Diane fantasy begins. The accident is there as an excuse for her to "return" her dead girlfriend and justify the life of fantasy. She recounts her girlfriend as humble and innocent because that is what she wished she was. Meanwhile, she acts like everything that is "in the movies" because she has the personality of the escait. She also, in a sense, kills herself and takes the waitress's identity as Betty in a restaurant. The story, which revolves around the director, is a direct consequence of her feeling that he was, in fact, sacrificed in reality, just as she was, and "convinced" he was forced to choose Camila. It was also a subconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in Fantasy is actually a random blonde out of engagement. She hated her so much that she changed her to Camille and made her the biggest adversary. She then took a real Camilla and changed her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-girlfriends movie and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also paints a hit man as a very clumsy and incapable man to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was the search for Diane, who ended herself, and died of the dream world by undergoing a series of comments of reality. The first comment was Club Silencio, who sang that "there is no band" and the "instruments" you hear are not there; this is a fantasy metaphor. He begins to shake violently because he shakes his surroundings. Another reminder is the blue box ... In fact, the blue box is not a reminder itself (more Pandora's box, really), but a blue button that opens that box. The blue key reminds her of Camille's real death, because what he said would turn out when it's done. Along with love, this whole creature is escaping from reality by living in an idealized Hollywood that is expected to be part of when it comes. This story shows the psychology of a very troubled woman who has lost her dream. It is not a series of random things that are specifically designed to disturb, and it is not a mysterious philosophical message. It is an unhappy piece of human condition that is beautifully presented. However, this is ultimately my opinion. Maybe I'm gone. Or it doesn't mean anything. There are many people who disagree with me. Great! After all, why does it have to mean something? Why can't it just be a statement in itself? What if there are cohesive, reasonable stories of shackles for artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenaway has spent many words eloquently supporting this idea with such statements as "I would say that if you want to write stories, be an author, be a writer, don't be a filmmaker. Creation is much more exciting in areas that are not primarily done with narration. And where is the rule that everything must be readily understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to its art. "I didn't get it!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.," a story or not, affects viewers, harasses them, pulls them, scares them, licks them. The way it fits into interpretation is amazing. It never gets tired. They never lose their shine. His visuals are always effective and beautiful. It is a film perfection no matter what. Enjoy.
