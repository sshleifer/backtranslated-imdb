Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and are in love with the way young boys are ever. But Dylan met the girl and puts these childhood things aside. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and he lacks what he had with Dylan. He said as part of the cheesy 80's pop video, part of the home movie, part of the video memories this movie tells a confusing and sad but all too often a true story that will hit the home with the many they see. This film brings a lot of memories and hit a very real chord with me, but I want the filmmaker to go a little further and leave him on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but it is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
