The definition of a vampire is a non-human corpse to leave his grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi this concept on the head minus minus the clich√© of pointed fangs and neck. Being a R rated movie, I knew it was actually going to cover the vampires actually being vampires. Which means the characters in the movie will do what the vampires actually do without limitations and rightly lack all the glamorous moments compared to Twilight. After seeing the previous Oldboya Chan-wooka Park, I had very great expectations from Bakjwi. I expected to see some unpleasant conspiracy with our anti-hero known as Sang-hyeon priest, who was very impressed by his performance as a holy man who is forced to be humane in this embarrassment. and listen to your thirst like a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial assumption that he will survive a faulty blood transfusion, he begins to crave blood and reveal his super power and flying ability. Images on the screen make its transitional phase without going to the show. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be killed for moral reasons. The tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with Tae-joo is very exciting because he is playing The Host's Kanh-Song and actress OK-vin Kim. Special effects are correctly placed in the background, and although they do not offer anything new in stunts and CGI, they have not been guided by the graph and character. The story and key points of the land are very perverse and grotesque, yet very original in their Korean style. There are not many negative things I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the priest's transition phase could show more priests with an emotional crisis with its transformation, but then it would make the movie 3 hours. The movie was long to begin. In the same thing, vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. As already mentioned, this film is very tragic, so do not expect anything hopeful to watch this expectation. Bakjwi is generally beautifully dark, morbid and original. I highly recommend this movie to reputable viewers who are the past teen phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean response of Let Let's Right One In, which is also a good movie.
