Long before Terri Schiavo brought the question of life as "vegetables" to the public view, "The Day of Death by Joe Egg" dealt with. Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely confused. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) are trying all kinds of dark humor to try their lives, but they can't escape the facts. They even consider euthanasia in one place. The question surrounding them and their friends is: what happens to this difficulty? With this movie, Alan Bates has continued to make really good movies, preceded by "Zorba Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can say for sure that it will be unfortunately omitted.
