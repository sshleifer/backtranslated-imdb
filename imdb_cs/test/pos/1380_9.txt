BUY FOR DOLLAR !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I saw much worse for much more !! Scottish sci-fi movie by Mark Stirton and by Making of (hysterical by the way) production only costs $ 8,000. Eight big !!! That would pay half a minute in Hollywood !! However ---- This is the best fun movie creation. If you like things bold then you are in for treatment. It is a rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing. I didn't mind, but my girlfriend did! The actors are doing a great job and it's interesting to see people I've never heard of or seen. That meant I didn't know who was going to die first. <br /> <br /> Watch Star Wars as you watch the film for its latest latest visual effects. The effects here are fine, but a little weak in space. But monsters are very well done if they like it a bit. At least it was not predictable and I almost fell off the chair when one guy got his head fired !!! OK, so it's a bit of a derivative of other science fiction, but for this budget it's an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks doing a science fiction movie on 8g is easy or becomes very clear doesn't know anything about the film industry. Good grades for a good movie, extra marks for working so hard, extra extra points for really interesting work. No standard bull here, all production problems are off making it as lost in Mancha with just the film at the end. But why no comment? KEEP GOOD CABINETS!
