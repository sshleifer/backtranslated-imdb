Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey act as Jonathan Silverman, as Eugene, recounts her life at Brighton Beach in 1937. \ tWhat makes a film so good is the relationship between characters with a background of extremely beautiful family value. Bob Dishy had a great opportunity as the clan's father. He gives a restrained but convincing performance as a patriarch of the family. His sons playing Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are wonderful. There are certain scenes when Silverman is skating or hopping where I reminded Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they're also great. Their mannerisms, intonations and idealism of Jewish culture make them beautiful. <br /> <br /> The camera is just amazing. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Although the inevitability of war has emerged, the film is rich in many of the typical problems faced by families during this period. In a sense, you don't have to be Jewish to experience what the family is going through. Must see nostalgic enthusiasts and those of us who so strongly believe in family values.
