Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great end to the golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, the atmosphere of tolerance, openness, and progressiveness was among the studios that allowed the production of large films by some of the best directors the United States had ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (few being violent deaths of the major personalities of American political and cultural scenes, racial fights, the emergence of 1960s anti-culture, increased violence, and death on the streets ...) influenced the vision of the filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different and create fun and smart movies. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful filmmaking, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time cheating on them with its fluent reflections on the value of life, the cause of death or ethics. war. It is also a passionate work, made against all courses, recorded in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: The Filmmaker's Apocalypse"; a film that went beyond any previous consideration of the Vietnam War that ever reached the screen. This may not be the definitive Vietnam film, but to deal with Coppola defied the pattern of classical melodrama found in the two films of Vietnam made simultaneously, "Deer Hunter" and "Return Home", or in the latter ones as "Platoon" and " ", Before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, like a horror in" Jacob's Ladder ", or comedy as" Good Morning, Vietnam ", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to embrace this economic and political conflict as a backdrop to finding answers to the questions that every person faces every day without betraying the dramatic consequences of this war.
