A frightening masterpiece of utter insanity and despair of war, Fires on the Plane (Nobi) will not taste for everyone: it is a war film in the true sense of the word that does not move to a fluttering flag. patriotism or carbohydrate sentiment. Nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, grim and bleak, as there will always be plenty of things on celluloid. This is a war for cannons, without victories or heroes, without moral victories or defeats that should be, just a handful of frightened and horribly looking men strewn over a country ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a major catastrophe. The characters resist moral judgment because they are creatures of great sorrow, a woe that does not allow questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Doing your will against others on the battlefield. The loser is simply removed from existence. Tamura, a soldier in the Japanese Imperial Army, is released from his platoon and commanded to report to a nearby hospital because of the coughing of his blood and the others not liking him. platoon. It is said to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital refuses him. What is he doing. The hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon just tells him that if he is able to walk, he is fine. It is in this shabby apology of the hospital that one of the most horrific scenes of the film takes place. Since the area is a carpet bombarded by US aircraft, doctors and those who can walk and maintain, run away from the hospital and into the forest. Moments before the hospital is thrown to pieces, the skinny and crippled sick and wounded figures crawl out of her in every kind of posture, dressed in their sick white robes, as if the building was a beast that spews out the interiors and dirt. This is Nobi's greatest success; sharp and tense portrayal of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. The soldiers cross the swamp, wading their knees in the mud, moving across the opposite bank and into the field, only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods, their lights shining as perilous eyes as they search through the darkness. Parade of injured soldiers, dirty and half mad, crossing the road, falling to the ground on the sound of enemy aircraft. Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. Abandoned village. A mad soldier who believes the Buddha is sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his own feces, which Tamuru offers when he is dead. These are the pictures Kon Ichikawa radiates for our eyes, merciless and unwavering in their honesty, but honest and raw. Nobi is in no hurry to get anywhere. It is content to follow Tamura's journey through the war-torn country, as he tries to get to the rearrangement center of Palompa, and regard the madness and obscenity of the war. The film goes through the sludge of the horror of war, slow and thoughtful, as well as the characters that follow. The last thirty minutes, when Tamura resorted to a haven with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat," is closest to Nobi, who is close to conventional stories and no less powerful. Incredibly photographed in black and white, with great casting performance and in some direction Ichikawy, Nobi is not only among the best war films to be made, but also among the best Japanese cinemas.
