It's hard for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a lot of Shasta Daisy on my back that I love to call "Chuckle Patch". My friends are laughing at me and watching me like I have 2 heads. It would be great to see this DVD series for us people who remember it with kindness with our other childhood memories, or show our friends that there was a really laughing patch! Where today's children's television is made up of violent cartoons, characters who make magic, or talking mushrooms that live in pineapple under the sea, the Magic Garden was real in the sense that it taught us good values. I'll have memories of Carole and Paul and Chuckle Patch.
