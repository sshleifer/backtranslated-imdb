After winning the championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drinking beverage that leads to the killing of an ambitious reporter. Although his manager killed that man, Mr. Garfield is blamed. When a manager dies in a car accident, wears Garfield's stolen watches, the authorities think the boxer is dead. Garfield, who is still WANTED, changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to a ranch in Arizona. There, Garfield implements "Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as TB), and Bernard Punsly (\ t t as Milt). Garfield associates with the young "Dead End" boys who have been sent to stay with sweet grandmother Rafferty (May Robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother. the deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, the pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to watch the kids. Of course, Garfield's past will return to haunt him? <br /> <br /> "John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids" make beautiful music (Max Steiner) together with the effective direction and photography of Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable with the support of Warner Brothers in good shape. Garfield and "Dead End" children are a winning combination; although Garfield made no further films with the "East Side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost instantly, for "Dust To Be My Destiny". The box is nicely staged. But the most exciting sequence is Garfield and four of New York's "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for swimming - which unexpectedly puts their lives at risk. Other, more concise, include the floozy Ann Sheridan (like Goldie), boasting Barbara Pepper (as Budgie) and the young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) who lose to strip poker. ****** ** Made me as a criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
