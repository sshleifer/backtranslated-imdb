Definitely "must see" for all film noir fans. <br /> <br /> With its subtle scenario and sharp, sharp razor blade, the top-of-the-line cast meets and works like a well-lubricated clock to produce a psychological thriller crackerjack. Wonderful characterization expresses a strong message of the film about racial and religious tolerance. It is difficult and almost unfair to choose a particular performance because there is no weak link across society, but Robert Ryan as a hateful and violent white supremacist is indeed a backbone cooling. Creating this film in the 1940s would be a lot of courage. Now, all these years later, at a time when contemporary films are dominated by the absurd abundance of indecent language, bare breasts, crazy acting and deafening soundtracks, it is refreshing to get back to the basics of high-quality filming with observation like Crossfire. Another low-cost gemstone from the Hollywood archives.
