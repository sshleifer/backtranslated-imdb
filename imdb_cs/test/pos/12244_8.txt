I loved this movie when I first saw it. This gives such details about what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get the story in the air: remarkably Jane Craig rushes Kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then Joan Cusack tries to get inside, and William Hurt who, according to Jane, commits an incredible breach of ethics, mimics his tears during a rape interview, a mistake Aaron pointed out. Another point is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and directing is almost as good. All three major actors were great in portraying their characters, Especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, whom is the funniest in the movie. William Hurt is also very good. This is worth at least three Oscars, the best actress (holly hunter), the best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and the best picture. I liked the last part of the film, which is found 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
