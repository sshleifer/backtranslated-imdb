Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about, well, Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women, led by Queen Bee. He fights to win his club, The Total Experience, back from Willie Green, who uses his kung fu skills and their dedication to him. I liked this film because of the witty dialogue and the use of Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach to his brothers in rhyme.
