He premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and loved the movie !!! I'm Diane's # 1 biggest fan and of course, as always, she gave a wonderful performance !! I've seen every one of her films and I have to say that it's one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and just took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly funny, but also serious. Anton Yelchin is simply an amazing young actor and has performed amazing performance. All in all, I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate the excellent film. 10 inches up !!! I would definitely see it again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
