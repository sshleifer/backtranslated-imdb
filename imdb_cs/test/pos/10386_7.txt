First, positive: excellent work in displaying urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film. Some shots could be images of De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. Negatives: stories are hard to believe. Unreal, uni-dimensional characters take precedence and take 100% of the time as if they were in a pier. It is not even Antonioni of his earlier, much better films or Wenders, which we all recognized and appreciated. Malkovich is an oversized bag in this movie.
