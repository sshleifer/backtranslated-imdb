In fact, I have not focused on the greater genocidal aspects of the story (although the terrible images at the beginning are very strong). I was really impressed by the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine living in your life when you don't know if you have a time bomb in you. I was really shocked to see Yasuko be rejected as a "tarnished" bomb. The image that remains with me most is when Yasuko stands in front of a hair combing mirror and watches silently as they look in clusters.
