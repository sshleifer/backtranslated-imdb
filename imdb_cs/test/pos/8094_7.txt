Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is a great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, Skewers Adolf Hitler. Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's spitting picture. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen Hitler's journalist will recognize the frightening form of the cartoon. I thought the movie started slowly, with the typical Chaplin slap-stick, dedicated to the adventures of the World War I barber. When I never saw him, I must admit that after the first 20 minutes or so I wondered what the fuss was about. But the film quickly picks up steam. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel-ism" to make a point propaganda. The highlight of the film is the brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the film. Just like Chaplin is in this movie, I thought Jack Oakie, playing the dictator "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni" - stole the whole thing. Our first look at Oakie shows how well he studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posture. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate the fate of "Osterlich" me in a stitch. It was a very good movie and it's worth watching.
