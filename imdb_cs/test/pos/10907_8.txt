This is a really funny movie. His dance scene with tape is one of the funniest scenes I remember. I thought the scene "I'm gay" at the high school graduation ceremony is a bit surreal, though it was funny. While I was watching him for the third time, I started picking up the small little segments I missed. One of them was when girlfriend Matt Dillon, a classic ditz, tried to use a phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this film successful alongside Tom Selleck. That was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; she proved to be fun. She confirmed it in the television series Will and Grace. One discovery I found after the third scan is Lauren Ambrose of '6 Feet Under' Fame. It stands out with red wounds, but it is obvious that it is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very entertaining on the principle of college.
