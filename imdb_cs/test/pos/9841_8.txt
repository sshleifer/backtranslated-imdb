Don't forget - before Sidney was there, Dudley was there. Dudley Digges is barely remembered today - because his flourishing as an accessory in sound films was in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Except for one main performance: the ship is natural, if the drunk doctor in 1935 is MUTINY ON BOUNTY, most of his films are barely revived. Next is a shame because he was an amazing actor. In 1931 he starred Casper Gutman (original actor playing that villain) opposite Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, at the same time, he played a recording angel in Leslie Howard's OUTWARD BOUND - the same role Sidney Greenstreet solved between the two worlds ten years later. Kicks might be nice and nice (it's again a ship's doctor), or repulsive (in CHINESE SEAS, like the first Mate's grinning poor Lewis Stone, but then proves that he's just the same in a moment of crisis) a great coward). He held his own against Paul Robeson in EMPEROR JONES. He is a Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper at GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. Here is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and thief of the reform school Frankie Darro and his friends sent to commit robbery and injury to a Greco-American shopkeeper (that's for most of them). Kicks are just as bad here as in CHINESE SEAS, but it's a close thing that doesn't really like him. He is able to somehow overcome his roles ... more about it later. Darro has gangs of city offenders (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As stated in the next review, this is the Bowery Boys prototype. We see how car owners are shaking to pay them to "watch and protect" their cars. If one does not do it, he will destroy his car. Suffering and grabbing a robbery in a Greco-American trade is also somewhat graphical - his skull breaks when pressed. Boys are rounded up and brought to a strict but respectable judge Arthur Byron, who realizes he can't leave kids with his parents: parents aren't able to track them or they are incapable. Unfortunately there are three racial stereotypes in this order: a Jewish father who is more interested in his business than with his son, Farina's stereotypical "Yassum" father, and an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate gets his son out to go out of reform. school. Once the boys find a regime that is repressive. Sometimes one of the guards or a nurse (Madge Evans) tries to talk to them. But Digges doesn't have time for coddling. His regime is determined to break the boy to behave themselves. Unfortunately, Digges and his accountant are greedy. They give boys worse food and profit. One day a new official comes out of the state to look at the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is a hacker whose gang got a vote for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he couldn't get the post of Commissioner Park) Cagney was assistant school inspector. He is supported by his hanger-on mate and factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). Ironically, if Digges was a little more cautious, Cagney would probably keep him running. But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges for the fight. The Rangers and Darrow had problems with respect earlier, and Digges now intends to punish Darro who flees - but seriously injured by Digges barbed wire fences and his free use of the whip. Cagney stops Digge and allows Evans to heal Darro's injury. And he explains to Cagney the reality of the situation and his own idea of ​​the actual reform reform of boys by building trust in them with responsibility. and Evans is on the right track, turning the reformator as a "republic" for boys to run correctly. This leads to a conflict with Digges, whose profiteering is reduced as he is no longer getting supplies. But the scheme is derailed when Cagney finds himself in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and takes it fully. But then he goes too far ... much more than he has ever negotiated. The 1930s had many movies that showed that children were taking steps to correct mistakes and change things. Darro appeared as WILD BOYS OF ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did THIS DAY AND AGE, where kids teach a lesson to a gangster who plays Charles Bickford who frightens hell out of him. So it went in the 1930s. The hell commander achieves a similar intensity of revenge and juvenile justice. But this is one film problem. Digges' character is a knight and a hypocrite, so we are never excited about him, but if he were not a thief we could go with his opinion (even if it is counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gang, who care for people, actually make the effects of a sharp edge look quite understandable (though his thieving ways aren't). He also has one moment when Cagney is rightly angry - at that moment hiding from his own conflict with the law - giving orders by phone from a long distance to the confused Digges. When Digges learns what actually happened, he is justifiably angry at Cagney, who is giving him lectures on good behavior. It's the closest thing to Mr. Thompson's sympathy for this great movie.
