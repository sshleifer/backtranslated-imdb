This is a very clever, well-functioning version of the fabulous romance of the "modern" woman of the 1930s. In this case, he helps the person he loves to become a company leader while at the same time serving as his secretary and ultimately wins his love from a modest social butterfly. Interestingly, her business sense is shown to be slightly parallel to her household fitness, and the office ladies are portrayed as "powers behind the throne." Mrs. Astor's intelligent performance raised above average.
