I sympathized with the difficult situation of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. He reminded me of the fear of lonely security at night - the kind of work I did shortly 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to death because the head of the colony (Lynch) likes to describe. The monster in the dark, killing members of the deep mining colony, creates a frightening impression in the first act. In fact, we don't see it in the early scenes and, as many of us realize, sometimes the best monsters are left to imagination. "Big and Hairy" is one of the described descriptions, but in reality it appears to resemble a large, lumpy pepperoni pizza that runs like a silicon millipede on the ground - unfortunately, it limits the show's budget. It also points to the latest matte image, known for Trek fans, the only way to convey a long shot of mining operations. But the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than an external performance. This Horta, a newly discovered silicon-based life form, looks like a mindless monster at first sight. With Spock's telepathic capabilities (probably the best use of the Vulcan brain for conspiracy purposes), we learn that it is a highly intelligent, even sophisticated animal. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy gets to replace his usual medical routine - healing a rock-like creature or asbestos. He also gets to say one of his most famous lines: "I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer!" In his scene, I found out that he was really loyal when he was enthusiastic about his success, though he wasn't able to get Kirk involved in his enthusiasm - Kirk's too busy organizational results. The episode throws unexpected turns in character and motivation at the audience as the story progresses; Spock fights for the need to preserve this discovered life when Kirk takes his usual attitude to preventing the death of any red shirts (without half-measures like "The Man Trap"). But later, it's Kirk who, for some reason, resides in firing a murderous explosion, as if the heat of the hunt was worn out and he had time to think about Spock's point (I believe it was during the making of this episode that Shatner learned that his father died). It's unusual for most of the first season, it's a happy ending. The conflict arises from the needs of basic capitalism, such as meeting standard quotas versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - the cosmic age version of the protection of owls from modern development tractors. Despite the many murders and the feeling that everything can be in hell at any moment with one raised phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to negotiate a deal that will satisfy everyone. I think people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
