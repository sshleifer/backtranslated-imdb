Tipping the Velvet (2002) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC TV. The basic plot is the story of the coming of age for the protagonist, Nan Astley, who played well Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in his family home. Everyone expects to stay home, then marry a suitable husband and settle in family life. Nan also expects it. Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothing and captures the viewer's heart. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually attracted to Kitty the way she is not attracted to her friend. The rest of the film follows Nan to London and through her ups and downs (terrible) as a lesbian and sometimes a male impersonator. <br /> <br /> As typical of the BBC, every role, no matter how small, is done by an excellent actor. The BBC has the depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly amazing. None of the supporting actors look in my mind - they were uniformly good. Both Stirling and Hawes are amazing and their performances carry the film. It is always sad to remind myself of how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit into the form of society for what is normal. I know it's not easy for lesbians even in the US, even today. Imagine the obstacles for love and happiness for lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
