SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I like the Simpsons and I've seen every episode that has ever come out. I have to admit that season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one. He says the game is stupid and doesn't want to play it, but needs it. She explains the word that angers Homer and haunts Bart around the house. The next day, Mrs. Krabappel assures the class that the test is not part of their class, just a test to tell them what their future will be. Bart can't answer one question. He thinks fast. Quickly toggles the test with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day Marge and Homer are called to go to the director's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly, a school psychologist comes in and tells Skinner and Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees to go because he doesn't have to do any homework. The next day Homer drives Bart to a new school. It is introduced to all and everyone. His day is not very good. Smart students cleverly crawl, can't read any comics, but his classmates criticize him as well. Luckily for Bart, he and Homer have a great time together, but Marge has bought opera tickets. They go to the opera and make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school, but his friends enjoy it. They call him a point tropic. While at his new school, Bart is said to have made a Chemistry experiment. He does it wrong and throws the green light into school. Bart tells the psychologist to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him he wants to go secretly and go back to his old school regarding other children. The psychologist is concerned and he asks Bart to explain on a piece of paper. It feels too hard for him, and instead writes a confession that he is not really a genius. He gives it to a psychologist. The only thing he cares about is that he spelled the word confession wrong. That night, Homer buys Bart and Bart tells him he's not really a genius and that he was cheating on the test. Homer is angry and haunts Bart around the house when Lisa and Marge look at them carelessly. Overall, this is a very underrated season, one episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
