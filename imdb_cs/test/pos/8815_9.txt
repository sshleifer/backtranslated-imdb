This movie was cheerful. This gave a somewhat comic look at the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a fun thing to do. The characters in this movie were so realistic for those of us who watched in my place that it was like watching a film about themselves. There were several key scenes that really made this movie: preparing scenes; scene "Give me a real doctor"; the white background scene shows every character in the overall state of being broken, resulting in the infamous line "what did I say?" and comedy-sunup scenes. I lived these moments alone and I laughed hysterically myself in my own ridiculous behavior. I can't give this movie 10 because it doesn't focus on Groove, which I thought was out of the world, but it certainly has its moments. Mise-en-scene and camera work are excellent, special effects are worth mentioning and acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After a long wait for this movie, I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. I hope to see more from writer / director in the future.
