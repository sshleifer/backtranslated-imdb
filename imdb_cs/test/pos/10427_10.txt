This must be one of the best movies we've seen, and we highly recommend it to expose the injustice of fanaticism. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and really amazing as Corby / White Wolf. However, the story felt would be increased if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again without fatigue.
