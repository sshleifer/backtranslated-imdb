I worked professionally with young girls on the run. I would never find a friend to borrow his videotape. There are classical themes: the coming of age, the postponement of a mother / daughter, the limited opportunities of a disadvantaged, who is a good samaritan, the tragedy is in every life and in many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice gets a gun, we know she has some knowledge of how to use it) and it doesn't end in clich√©. The cast actually sells its roles. It's adult material and the sound is a little grainy. Leave it for 15 minutes to get you inside.
