1979 Tourist Trap is a clever, unique B thriller that stands out as one of the best of its kind. Travelers stop in lonely wax where the owner's dummies are a bit like life. While the film has hints of the Texas Mass Saw Massacre, the tourist trap is mainly a ghostly psychological thriller worthy of The Twilight Zone. Director David Schmoeller gives this film an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that achieves scary proportions. Also, Schmoelloer adds an occasional touch of comic relief to bizarre events. Venturistic actor Chuck Connors is the best of the serious cast of the movie. Music score Pino Donaggia is excellent, with both lyrical and festive themes ideal for the film. Many movie sequences are quite unforgettable. <br /> <br /> For horror and thrill fans, the tourist paste is an unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
