Funny and funny rescue scenes help make it one of my favorite 14-movie series. Beautiful acting, great cast. And this film contains one of the few facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fall from the horse into the water was not written, but remained in it because they both set out right after it happened. This is a good step towards the intense ending of Sharpe's enemy.
