When the slow start starts, the movie begins and in many unexpected ways it becomes really fun. The cast is really good, with Heather Graham perhaps the weakest. Casey Affleck as her brother is really good and very likeable if you catch my drift. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the movie if you want to have a good time. Teenagers should really enjoy this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
