This applies to almost every area of ​​the creative process and goes through three phases chronologically, with a direct focus on production. There are documents that go into more detail, and cover the other two groups better. These are works of art, backstage footage, movie clips and many interviews. With the running time coming in just two hours, the audience is entitled to a lot of information, as it is almost the same length as the movie itself. One might argue that much time is devoted to people, to the craft and the result of their joint effort in the other. This is well done, with a tight fit. It gets into technology and reveals how certain effects have been achieved. It spends a lot of time on physical training, preparing for combat, and so on. You will get nice sincere footage of people, crew and actors. Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc also includes nearly three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual song selection and Play All, which is approximately 38 minutes of BTS value next to the title itself, in various features. The original edition, however, has several very short accessories, including production clips of the sequel, preview of Animatrix and Yuen Wo Ping's tape blocking (complete run-through pair of greatest martial arts sequences, with sensation artists and almost exact cinema, with the same footage and angles of these pieces in the finished silver screen effort). The language is quite strong, but rather rare, almost non-existent. I recommend either this version to anyone who likes this concept, or wants to know how they first got together. 7/10
