I still can't believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends in the forum, I swear I'll watch it. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch his parts in the shopping mall, where they had many DVDs with Advent children and showed up on several notebooks for sale. Of course I was thrilled, but it wasn't enough. Then I went to YouTube.com for a movie. All I came to was to dedicate music video. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I watched it despite all the distractions because I knew I had to watch, otherwise I would be called loser. <br /> <br /> I had more about the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash couldn't be better. But I wouldn't ruin the show for you. You have to look at it yourself! Get DVD Now!
