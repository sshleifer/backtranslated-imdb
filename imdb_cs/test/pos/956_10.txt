If you've seen the telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you'll find it very similar in the story, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. While this is a "Okkadu" remake, you'll find that Vijay and Trisha are making this unique movie, Vijay and Trisha are making a great pair. Several negatives were when the Vijays character kills the Trishas character for buying a gift for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him at the end. Good actions and songs make him a great movie that I recommend. I'm giving him 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
