"Chinese Syndrome" could not be released at a better time: twelve days after its release, it became an infamous screw on Three Mile Island. But even if it (and / or Chernobyl) never happened, this film remains an important view of what might happen as a result of poor management of nuclear facilities. Jack Lemmon performs in a five-member show as the supervisor tries to uncover cover in his nuclear power plant, with Jane Fonda playing a reporter trying to investigate, and Michael Douglas playing his cameraman. I don don't know if the current threat of a terrorist attack is making the "Chinese Syndrome" more disturbing, but in any case, it's definitely a movie that everyone should see. I hope those people who have spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so that they could know that their views and ideals were completely extinct.
