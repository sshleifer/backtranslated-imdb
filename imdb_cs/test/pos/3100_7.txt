The characters of Ma & Pa kettle were very popular and controversial. The films that represented their breeding paved the way for the TV sitcoms that followed him and tried to emulate their winning formula. One obvious reference is 'Beverly Hillbillies,' where a new home was bought with oil money, not being won in the competition. You could even say that the "Newhart" sitcom of the 1980s borrowed the idea of ​​backward country characters from this series. Yet I wonder if Betty MacDonald, a Washington author who created these characters, did no more harm than good. Her depictions of the villagers make them an ass of many jokes about their alleged negligence and laziness. (The real life family Macdonald founded by Kettles sued ... claims to be ridiculed and humiliated by these less than flattering references). Sure, it's a comedy and the situation brings us a lot of laughter and fun moments ... and the political correctness we know today didn't exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could write these characters more sensitively, and Universal International could let his writers show them on the screen with more dignity (such as good taste). More realistic moments are when eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but he learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are. Kettles must realize that they do not fit into the modern world exactly. It's not a joke ... that's a sober truth.
