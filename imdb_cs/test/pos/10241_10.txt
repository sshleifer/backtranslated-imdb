This movie was really well written and was very entertaining. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as always) If you are looking for an interesting movie to look at, it should be on the top of the list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what actors feel in points. This movie really impressed me. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. North America could rupture and Jack and his team must try to stop the eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you'll be too.
