Scandinavians are pretty good at mixing me with the dull nothing of my mindless life, huh. a palette, every snippet of the muzak or whooosh of those aisle cleaners was there to put the calm emptiness of this world home. truly funny and portable. Just as when Andreas tells his boss he misses children and looks up and the guy smiles and halfway through the door, it's a sad but true reflection of working with people. Of them, than the people you love, but ultimately knowing deeply that they don't give the hell of their problems and you as well. It could have been a movie Coens did when they were born. in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and more wrapped up in the past of cinema, but they have the same mastery techniques and their films have the same basic meaning that life is quite unimportant. I'll stop before I talk to the bus alone in the winter wilderness.
