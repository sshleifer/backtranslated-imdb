I saw the movie the same night I saw 6 more shorts. This one was a step ahead of others in the quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of the story. Comes with professionalism, often missing in short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short movie for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performance. Two actresses are convincing and instantly believable. Their chemistry is palpable; The depth of their relationship is transmitted even if the movie is 10 minutes long. Acting and directing are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot. Lighting, framing and general shooting are striking. The 35 mm film features this film unlike other shorts. And the difference it makes. Filming is worthy of this movie. 3. A strong story. Short films often try to do too little or too much time. Or try to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance that tells you an interesting story without getting it too long or leaving you unhappy. You wonder what happens next, and feel that you've seen something. <br /> <br /> Nice score. Compliments without overcoming. <br /> <br /> If you find it at the festival, try to see it.
