Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this movie in theaters at a relatively young age of 10 years. The trailers on TV displayed the movie as a comedy, so I listened to my parents until they took me. After watching the movie I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Totally different from anything I've seen before, so there are many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I saw it in 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the biggest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form, like a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and a psychiatrist who develops a bond with him and tries to decipher his secret. Supporting casts are also perfect, every resident of the mental facility is incredibly persuasive in its own way. The open end was mastered very well, giving a lot of evidence to support whatever you believe happened at the end. As I was unable to earn at least this year's Oscar nomination, it is over. If you haven't seen this movie, go to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in a convenient basket, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
