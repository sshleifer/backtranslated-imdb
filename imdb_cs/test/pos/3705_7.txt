When his older mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her sublessor Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, television news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) tries to keep her dear old mom from satisfying her hunger. Although the above conspiracy summons images of the fearsome, horror, horror, and horror titles of the 1980s, such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mommy actually appears to be a refreshing original formula for a werewolf / vampire / zombie mythos (exactly what's going to happen to Emily is never really clear, but it's not nice!) as well as a touching study of a close bond between mother and son: Clay's commitment to his mother leads him to leave all his other duties, including his work and His relationship with Alice's pregnant girlfriend (Mary Beth McDonough) while Emily's love for Clay eventually drives her to self-destruction. Technically, the movie could be sharper, more stylish, and better effects (Creatures are very brief to disappoint) and some more experienced cast members are frustrated with terribly raw performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I AM referring to you); Fortunately, however, a strong emotional undercurrent in a well-formed story is enough to ensure that mom is an effective, convincing and sometimes shocking story that I do not hesitate to recommend to those looking for something else. .
