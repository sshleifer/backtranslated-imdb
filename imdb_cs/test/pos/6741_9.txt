It seems that the viewer who said he is disappointed is missing wildly. This is an excellent film, an excellent and realistic depiction of a Central European Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. These nuances are perfect, and I felt the casting was superior. Especially I found a meeting that Judith Ivey had done, just perfection - especially the speech she had with her daughter when her daughter returns home late at night. The scene was a good Oscar. But in fact everything was fine. I recommend this movie. It's fun, family movie and wonderful to see how beautiful middle class lived in Brooklyn so long ago. You see it and you'll be glad you did it. She has some very funny lines and Eugene character is a real comedian - very funny.
