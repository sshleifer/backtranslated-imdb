Like others who commented on the web ... I am 130 Coast Guard pilots. When I said it and I was a skeptic, I was expecting excessive factors of cheese. There was some cheese, but in all, not much .. and the movie was pretty accurate. Today I saw a trailer. After yesterday's movie, I realized that the trailer made the impression that the film was nothing but a rescue after the action action scenes. This is not the case. The film is actually more built / story driven than action. The internal struggles of both Costner and Kutcher are engaged .. Kutcher is unveiled further than a movie than Costner's. Of course there is a smaller love story .. no surprise there. But for the most part, the film tells the story of two lives that come together, and after some time they help each other to heal the old wounds. As a girl, as it sounds, Costner and, like I try not to love him, Kutcher actually works pretty well together and compliment each other very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> As critics have said, you've seen it all before .. Top Gun, Officer and Gentlemen, etc. But what movie wasn't a million times over? I only remember one word that is spoken. > <br /> The movie is 2+ hours and for some it may tend to be a little longer at the end. You'll laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it was worth $ 4 I paid for. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
