"Murder over New York" is fun, but not as good as most of the other Fox Chans. This movie would be better named, "Charlie Chan in New York", the working title of the movie. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. There's a lot to like here, including guest star Shemp Howard of three Stoogs. This has one of my favorite sayings, Chan, "Coincidence as an Ancient Egg - Leaves Unpleasant Odor." Toler and Yung are good at this, as well as supporting cast. But in these films there is little or no mysterious atmosphere. Good to see.
