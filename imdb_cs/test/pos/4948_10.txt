This was an amazing movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic! I've seen it several times and I've kept my attention all the time. I am a big fan of the Air Force myself and I like to watch any movie where I can see the F-16. If you like Top Gun, then I guarantee that you will love this movie as well. In addition to a few mild curse, this is an excellent film for the whole family. He has a great storyline and he doesn't have the whole boring moment. Every second is packed into action and keeps you on the edge of your seat and waits for what happens next. So once again I recommend this movie !!!
