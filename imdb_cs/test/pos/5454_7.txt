I read a book written by Bill Carter on which this film was founded many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the film. It provides more detail than the movie can provide, the end result is that I thought the movie seemed a bit of a handful of items. All things considered, though, and given media restrictions, the film provides a completely entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90's to host "Today Evening Show" after Johnny Carson's retirement. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly performance. I can't think of any harder performance for an actor than playing a character who is still alive and familiar and on TV regularly. John Michael Higgins perfectly nailed the part of Letterman. Watching him was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to be Jay Leno, but somehow he didn't pull it out so effectively. His whole "gaze" seemed to be false, and he does not seem natural in his role. In a less central role, Rich Little surprisingly nailed Carson's voice, though the view was a little off. The most interesting of the central characters in the book was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the movie, Kathy Bates was perfect in the role, though not quite out of control as Carter's depiction of a woman in writing. <br /> <br /> At the end, it's light and fun viewing. The subject is not particularly important in the overall scheme of things, but it is a fun backstage view of an unforgettable time in the entertainment industry. 7/10
