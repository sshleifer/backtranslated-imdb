What can I say? The Curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but reasonably stupid, jokes are hillarious, puzzles are mysterious ... you couldn't ask for more in the adventure game. The "You don't need to see your bit" bit in itself is worth buying a game, not to mention Murray, who has become a hot topic for many of my friends (only some of them played the game). You will love this game. And if not, so wrong!
