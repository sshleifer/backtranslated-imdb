A somewhat typical piece of filming from this time. Obviously, it was first conceived in this world for the stage, but still a very good film from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York take care of their performance on the silver screen. There is very little in the way the story and anyone who is not familiar with this type of off beat character study can be a bit of a put off it. All in all, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to work.
