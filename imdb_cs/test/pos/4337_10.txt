Death Wish 3 is exactly what should be a bad movie. Terrible meeting! Unlikely scenerios! Ridiculous scenes of death! Scary, evil-free-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie could be the best 30 minutes ever made for a movie, especially in a scene where decent, hardworking citizens cross the street, knock down bad bikers and then shoot them just to join them children (!!!) to celebrate. And how can I forget an older woman with a broom? Sweeps out the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how fast the punks give up after the Fraker is killed. I just laughed about it. I also love Kersey's girlfriend's death scene. He just walks away after seeing her blown up. It's so little that makes Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack. This movie I watched for Martin Balsam, who really thinks he's one of the best actors in history (and who's alone) who beat the scum "the scene is cheerful" and I went out with favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3 for laughing. Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. The strange sound effect after Kersey says "Cash!" when buying a used car. Ha! Sounds so bad. 2. MANDY FRAKER. Mandy! Did the writers come to hard names? 3. The fact that gangs have apparently "robbery and lending" exchange: "I need more guys." And that Mandy has a working phone line in the abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey throws out Fraker: is it just me, or does it look like a street gang is about to break into choreography as they surrender? Just watch how they are synchronized after a woman punk gives a "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing brings me up like Death Wish 3!
