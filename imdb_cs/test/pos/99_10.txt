This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes one of the most thought-provoking short movies I've ever seen. The themes he addresses are ugly, cynical, and sometimes fearsome, but the film remains beautiful in its language, refined by its camera angles and beautiful style, a skillfully renewing short story of the same name written by the master. short stories, Tobias Wolff. I will not want to spoil anything from the movie, I will not go into any detail, rather than say that this film itself is amazing. He is proud of what he does and does it well. This shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be ended with a single worst feeling: an unexpected bliss. This film, by its own will, created in me the same feelings that the main character (Tom Noonan) had when the words changed his existence, and that is one impressive performance.
