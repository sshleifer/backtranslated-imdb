First, I hardly watch Swedish movies, and that's actually the second time in my life when I watch a Swedish movie in a cinema! That's why I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of excitement and humor is HIGHEST and sometimes you don't even know if you should be scared or just laugh! The story is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans start over. On his way to Germany, he tries to help his friends on the train, which is a bad idea. What an awkward jerk! And poor Robert Gustafsson - wounded soldier - always in the way ... OUCH !!! But he still had his great mood. Positive guy. Robert Gustafsson has made some less great movies in recent years and that is really a relief. It's great in this movie. After all, this is one of the best Swedish movies ever and Peter Dalle did a great job! Congratulations!
