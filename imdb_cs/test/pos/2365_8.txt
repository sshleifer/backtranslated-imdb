Great 1980s comic book comedy set in southwestern England. It's a story about sex, drugs, creamy teas and murder by the sea. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) is trying to impress his girlfriend by boasting a few million pounds of drug trafficking. This leads to complications with cheerful results. I'm trying to find out the original image ratio for this movie, but it doesn't appear under the "Technical aspects" of IMDb. I noticed a DVD in the store and it seems to be 1.33: 1 (full screen). Was the film shot in this proportion or was it originally a widescreen movie with a pan and a DVD scan? It would be useful to know how I hate pan and scan movies. So let's go to IMDb. Could you find out?
