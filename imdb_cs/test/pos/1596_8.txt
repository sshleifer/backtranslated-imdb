The greatest tragedy faces being able to divine so often that it settles on the banal. Death in Venice is one of the few films with patience and bravery to face this fact. Facing the human eye with beauty and inspiration in its two inevitable human forms - self-denial and decline. This is undoubtedly the biggest movie that has no effect on mainstream cinema. His austere, sophisticated look, echey echo, a mix of languages ​​without subtitles, and very challenging topics that can't be copied: just like the accident of his special production from her director's vision. Central performance, suddenly stiff, excited and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence, highlights Bogarde as if he were not the best British actor of his generation, who is surely the noblest. Able to follow the sympathy of his desires, despite his endless shots and Mahler's score playing over him, neither for Friday night with his girlfriend, but for sure, if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitations.
