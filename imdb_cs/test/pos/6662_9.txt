Anthony Minghela (writer / director) Cold Mountain is a carefully designed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederation during a civil war that deals with war politics in a very subtle and realistic way. While accurately reflecting the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it also does something that many films relate to this period, so that it does not work so efficiently - the Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and shows the changes among non-slaves possessing a common war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not outnumber Southern, Northern or anyone else. The film feeds on genres as needed - never a boring moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action adventure and a historical fiction, all nicely woven into one. The story focuses on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) who are Smitten with them for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to build, Inman enlists in the Confederate Army, taking with him the book Ada gave him and her photo. The character of Ada is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because viewers experience this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly from start to finish. Ada is the intelligent southern belle and daughter of the Liberal Minister. The film begins as a daddy girl who has qualified in many arts for being expected to be taught by southern women, mostly surrounded by servants. In other words, as Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) admits, he is the master of all that is unnecessary. Dad's father is moving, and she is left alone to administer her modest property. Without experience of this kind, he fights and survives by keeping the memory of Inman close to his heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman being brought up by a drunk and a sloppy father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks, and because they become inseparable business partners, they grow into each other's love as the best friend. Inman's experience is a radically different but something mirror image. During their participation in the war, they see many friends killed because of the causes they do not believe in and decide to leave. No one he meets comes to rescue when he starts a thousand-foot walk back to the Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of them meet. both protagonists, as they live, teach, grow and change. The ongoing act of will carried by despair preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it's his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada, it is the same, but also the symbol and remnant of the old South - a world that quickly passes. <br /> <br /> The camera is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The screenplay and editing are also extremely strong - they emphasize the broad classes and educational differences that are reflected in the southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. The cast of this film should not be expected to be anything less than perfection. And cast, mostly, rises to this occasion. My only criticism, however, concerns the accents adopted by Kidman and Law. Australian and Brit probably would not be expected from accurately reproducing South American speech, but there are few opportunities where these two exceptionally talented actors produce disturbing voice cries. I admit my excessive sensitivity and I can say with certainty that most people don't mind. Zellweger's performance is excellent and creates a character that I remember in my aging. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
