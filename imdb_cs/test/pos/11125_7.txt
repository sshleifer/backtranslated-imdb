This movie was well done, but it also sometimes put a lot of stress on me. For anyone who is considering a show business, this shows how it shows a raw solution in what is happening to these struggling workers. The soundtrack was definitely cool, and the acting and the dance praised it. Some of the student's attitudes might be a bit appealing like Leroy, especially since I'm sure someone like that would be immediately fired for not refusing to read and was a real High School For Performing Arts. The Coco Screen Test is hard to observe on all people who have weak stomachs, please follow my warning. While it's very brave, I know it's true about what's going on, so in this regard, the film is right there. Overall, it's fun, and although some parts drag most, it's really fast. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movies: You'd probably skip this content. DVD Purchase: Not something I have to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rent: It is worth to rent at least once in your life!
