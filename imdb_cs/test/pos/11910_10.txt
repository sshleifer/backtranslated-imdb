I don't understand how people dislike this film. You have Gossit Jr., a guy who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. Lots of events and entertainment you can't see in today's movies. It's really a shame. This is an underrated movie that is one of the other great movies like Let's Get Harry. The 80s and early 90s created such great films that will never be overcome today's standards today. They tried to make this film in Mastermind somehow, but they came up with short boundaries. All that was going on was Patrick Stewart, but apparently it wasn't enough.
