An amazing little movie that plays Mary Astor as a go-getter that works as a paper company that fights paper, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, he comes up with a plan for employees who buy a cracked company. Salesman (Robert Ames) as "front", even though it's a brain. Of course, he becomes a great success and becomes his executive secretary, basically always running and teaching him to the classroom. He loves the drug, but he never fights when he fights with bimbos. He is persecuted by a married but separate man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not single. But when the company catches Ames, everything goes to hell. Astor is just as amazing as an overly clever woman who almost makes a huge mistake after losing her husband. Ames is good as a jerk (but what does he see in it?) And Cortez is good, but he has nothing to do. Kitty Kelly is good as a sidekick, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is a child-owned company, and Edna Murphy is fun as Daisy. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
