I saw "Into Pitch Black" at t.v. so I had to see it. I must say, I was very impressed. Not only did David Twohy improve because he wrote "Critters 2", this movie was brought to me by Vin Diesel. Sure, he was there in "Into Pitch Black," but here he was furious, scary and intense. I have never seen Charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 1980s. The story is pretty simple, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then what happened to the female leadership happened. Unexpected. Dark humor helps the film move, the effects are not big, but when Riddick fights with the alien ... he blew all my complaints out. Diesel has not done much of this movie since then, but I am looking forward to continuing.
