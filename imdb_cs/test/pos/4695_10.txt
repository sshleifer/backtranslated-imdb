To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan on one of the many DVD comments, it was enough for the "wobble music" over the HTV logo to jump from what I was doing to put my face on the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained in the series were excellent and the character development was amazing. Loxley's Robin goes through a very convincing way through two series in which he appears, though his departure from the program was unplanned. Marian also develops his relationship with both Herne's sons very well. After many years in the wilderness, in the mid-1990s, I met a series on Sky 1 in the UK and was even more astonished that the series looked even better than I remembered. It is not a children's television program, it deals with witchcraft, betrayal, rebellion and injustice. And it does without showing too much blood. As I recall, you see only a little red stuff in the Pilot of the Movie (episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great, they contain a lot of add-ons, including comments on casting only on Series 3 (Jason Connery Robin) and crew comments for Series 1 and 2. Image quality is very good and remixed surround sound is amazing. The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing has ever been forgotten.
