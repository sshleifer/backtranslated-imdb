When I first watched Flatliners, I was impressed. It had all the necessary features of good film: the cast was excellent, the storyline was excellent, and in the case of thrillers, there was a true "thrill" throughout. Keifer Sutherland offered amazing performance as a male leader in the work, depicting a scientist who believes he can find answers to life and death by killing himself and then returning to life, basically stealing the secret of death. Kevin Bacon offers outstanding performance as a morally more respectable Keifer counterpart, while Julia Roberts offers her most compelling role. William Baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and probably in touch. And Oliver Platt, in another excellent performance, portrays the voice of reason for the band and the most innocent. The story is quite simple, yet original and acting is refreshing. a film for the genre, and one that has set me the standard for measuring other thrillers. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
