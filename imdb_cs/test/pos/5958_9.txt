It seems M. Hazanavicius is back! The man behind "la classe am√©ricaine" returns with a really fun and clever sequel to the old-fashioned OSS-117 ... While directors tend to "overestimate" the continuation of old classics (Don't Forget Avengers, Urk), Hazanavicius has decided to work on a really cheap hero OSS-117, a kind of low-budget French 007, decided to do it in the old school ... Photos, body postures, choreography of fights and FX, all as a tribute to the way the films were shot in the 1950s. And it works because the tone and movie jokes are really good! Jean Dujardin embodies perfectly this stupid, arrogant macho-selfish French spy, lost in the land he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. no, i won't say it has to do with what's happening today in the same area ... ah ah) ... it looks just like the frozen Lino Ventura, with less than 40 pounds less, ideal for other members The cast perfectly fit also, with everything you can dream of Russian spies, Egyptian independent and former Nazis.And of course women, how there must be "femmes fatales" in any good spy-movies ... The story is good (maybe not brilliant, but really good enough ...) that takes place between real historical facts and in a humorous way remembers us as France (and others) treated the colonies in those days. It all starts in 1955 with a British spy disappearing while watching a Russian cargo full of weapons in Suez.Then France sends her best friend, an OSS-117 agent, to find out what happened to both the shipment and the agent ... The fact is this agent he is really as stupid as he can be, and slipped through the story without understanding it and solved it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say that I had a bad feeling about the film because the publicity around it was quite scary and that French humor was quite populist and flat (forget about the bronzes 3 or camping ...) but I was really Surprised and in a good way ! I highly recommend that you want a good parody of Bond-esquire movies (much more fun than, for example, DEBS but less skirts), or you are a fan of the true and honest way of filming that they had back in 5O. Yes, that's clever and (really!) Funny, you have a point again, Mr. Hazanavicius!
