First, is it obvious as a cop drama crossed with funny melodrama, Quay? is a worrying, directly independent and threatening banality. Jouvet's aplomb is well used in heavy police performance, which is immediately apparent in its strength and exuberant power; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of great life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? it is not subversive in the sense that today's (and yesterday's) philistines use the word. It's the most playful hour of Clouzota. He tended to adapt Steeman's books with a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels.) As a director, Clouzot's firm hand is successful. It's not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at the Parisian couple and the police. Those who are accustomed to the masterpiece of Clouzota LES DIABOLIQUES, might find a little disturbing amount of things, styles, elements in QUAY ????????????@Mail.ru the world and about old spinsters, about police techniques and old bitter cop with boy raise, etc .. Is there a note of exuberance ?? not only in Jouvet performance, but also in the concept of film. Quay is a realistic crime drama created as a satire. It offers the excellent performance of Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (fought in Africa, but did not stand on the staircase because of his independent behavior); lives with his son, a schoolboy; At work, Antoine is a tough and ruthless, capable inspector, bitter, intelligent and cruel. It is a role of great tastes, very picturesque. Jouvet composed his character of several defining features - his clothes, his expression, his witty accent, his brutality, and the mocking air - Antoine is not invented to look smarter than plausible; when investigating Blier, Antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented as a talent we encounter in real life - mixed with mistakes and flaws. Talent Antoine is the one who also comes from experience, from daily observation, it is not almost the supernatural genius of almost all known detectives. <br /> QUAY ?? it is multifaceted - it is a realistic criminal drama and also satire and melodrama. This can be considered the first _film incursions into the legendary tenacity of the French police. Before Eastwood and Wayne were tough cops, Antoine was there. The title is interesting, indicating that it is a movie about the police, not a case or a mystery. As a craft, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (in the way Welles was). QUAY ?? is very true to Clouzot's character - sardonic comic, sharp observation, much psychology, sharp, indecent irony. The man was the first to shoot something he knew to shoot, what to choose? See the opening scenes of this film with great success by Jenny Lamour. Every scene is unforgettable, unexpectedly shot. Clouzot's technical, stylistic skills were amazing. His style is resourceful, satirical, sharp, extremely clear, sophisticated. Jouvet's style was lush, strong, sharp. (Some did not like it just for these features. Since he was a great theater actor, his film style was considered too theatrical, etc.) His Antoine is a good example of what was meant by the composition of the composition, the composition. Jouvet had a very special physiognomy? similar to the menacing bird of prey? somewhat like Van Cleef ?? even more subtle, refined and smarter, and differentiated. Jouvet had this ferocious, furious air, and it's useful because he's doing an old hard cop. One of QUAY's parties is that it is a Jouvet recital. It is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of its game (I see that many people watching this movie don't know it's a Jouvet movie - which is in itself a stunning quality). Fresnay and Jouvet are two French actors I admire most; the first was revealed to me by the drama Renoir (famous), while Jouvet Carn√© comedy. I was enchanted to see that Clouzot gave the leading roles to both of them. At the end of the word about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, like Comedy Fresnay). Steeman was an old school writer of secrets in the vein of Wallace. He became quickly obsolete with new hardboiled fashion. When I was 11, I read one of his thrillers and I liked it a lot.
