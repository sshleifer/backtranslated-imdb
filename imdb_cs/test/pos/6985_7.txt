* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black was pretty nice, with some nice effects - I liked bigger beasts, even though they're not patches on Aliens from the Alien series. It had a pretty good atmosphere that I felt Vin Diesel helped to contribute to. <br /> <br /> One thing that stuck with me was how it rained. If the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight, where did the moisture come from to create clouds and thus rain? I liked the fact that Fry died in the end - it reminded me of the New Hollywood Movies of the 1970s when the main character did not end.
