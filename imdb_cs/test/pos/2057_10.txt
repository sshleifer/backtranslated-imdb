I am a happily married 49 year old woman who just happens to love this movie to death. Geena Davis's character is strong, clever and kicking her ass ... I thought she did an excellent job in this movie (that's underestimation). She is my alter-ego ............. when she starts with this assault rifle in an old hotel room ............ .. ....... I have chills ............... she did it as if she knew what she was doing ............ it is one of mine most popular parts in this movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserved an Oscar for her acting and physical roles ........ <br /> <br /> have 'CHARLY' tattoed on my back .............. I'm one of those girls who NEVER are VICTIM ....... ............ ... I'm like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and isn't it so sexy?)
