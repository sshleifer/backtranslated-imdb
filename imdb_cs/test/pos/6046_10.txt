Hey there army Sgt. I'm sorry dude, but being an SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard doesn't mean you're qualified to comment on the Marine movie. You're not a Marine, and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can be concerned about being a Marine. We are simply the best, we have the hardest training, yes, we have big heads of ourselves, but hey, when you are the best, you want to straighten your stuff. I was in an invasion of Iraq and Fallujah. I fought beside the soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one that starts the whole "which branch is better", but you don't have the right to say you're qualified to judge a Marine movie. Yeah ...... we're drill instructors ....... not SGT drill. This is the greatest clue you are talking about. Yeah, we no longer have a "curse" on recruits. Tell me how is it about someone who makes them a better sailor? How does anyone hit me to make Marine a better ship? Yes, it's a more kind boot camp from what I went through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We train people who are all smarter than our generation. We want smarter recruits, not nothing. And anyone who first registers as a Marine has the determination to be the best his country can offer. We don't have to reinforce it in the Bootcamp. Marines come to the Bootcamp who want to be murderers. We do not have to teach them by demoralizing them by swearing and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say that. I was on the battlefield many times and trained Marines and Recruit, who eventually ended up on the battlefield. But then again what I know. I was there, done it, got a shirt. SGT Army ....... get a clue!
