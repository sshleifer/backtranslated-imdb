Stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this movie, even though he displayed a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story, and when I was this adult biography, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only can it boast of Stewart's power, but also a lot of fascinating technical data, making it easy for those who are technically demanding, like me. And the appearance of the plane itself was great. I liked this depiction of the pre-birth period and revived the childhood love I had for planes and the idea of ​​air travel.
