This movie set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. This was achieved through energy performance leadership, camera perseverance (avoiding the "rock-video" clich√©s that were invented by the Beatles in their first two films), strict editing and disapproving presentation of a star as a human being rather than a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are tiny holes and random details on the property, which are a bit unnecessary, and there will always be a debate between the families personally involved in the specifics. But the problem is that in the much newer "I walk the Line" or Carpenter's renowned TV Elvis in the same era, whether the meaning of the artist's life, his time and place, as a catalyst for fan ideals and recognition, is reflected in performance, and that is in this case clearly. We're leaving this film and we understand not only how Buddy Holly has become a star, but why. I don't see what another might want from a movie.
