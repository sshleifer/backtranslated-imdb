I saw it last night and it was great. I see why some ppl have bad feelings about rugby fan and maori cultural point of view, but besides, I have no idea what's so negative. The movie is great. He has a lot of heart. Very inspiring and encouraging for all ages. Great Family Movie! They did a pretty good job because it was a budget movie. I love movies based on true stories / events. All my life I've been raised around rugby, it's a great game, but I've never really been married because (please forgive me if I offend someone, nothing personal, that's how I saw it) I thought I was their workouts aren't ruthless or arguing, the players aren't so disciplined and they didn't look as serious as other athletes and it looked like it was all just muscle and blooming with each other etc. But when I saw Forever strong, I was glad wow! I was proud! It did good things for rugby (well changed my rugby look) and also the new Zealnd Haka. Actually, I called. I am neither New Zealand nor proud of their culture. He didn't even know what the chant meant to this film. The film is not about rugby techniques or rugby, it's not even about New Zealand All Blacks or Haka or etc ...... Perla !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So for you all the beautiful negative ppl, you miss a point! I'm sure if they had the means, it would be better, haka is there because it was part of Highland Rugby culture, tradition or whatever you want to call it. So no new members on this site like me, please don't be discouraged by these negative comments. You see it yourself! Must see the movie! There are many things you can learn from this movie, ppl of all ages. It definitely wants to be a better person and be humble! This film reminded me of a lot of things I already knew about and was brought up, but I lost my way! He loved it! Happy reading ppls and all the best! Muawha!
