Wow, that's my best sitcom from Friends. If you've had a bullshit day just sit down with a beer (if you're old enough that is.if no root beer will have to do.) And watch a couple of episodes, this is the perfect recipe for luck. I like the most that everyone in the show is very funny and they all have a fantastic timing of comedy. After a while you become connected to the characters and really care for them. I think the secret of success shows that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but still happy with him, he loves his wife and his friends. Father in law is to fly in ointment, but hey notes perfect.
