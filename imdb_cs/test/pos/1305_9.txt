I noticed this movie on holiday at the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York and it seemed a little stupid. And certainly, the whole premise is ridiculous for words - but it turned out to be a really nice action movie for both children and their parents. 10-year-old Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett) has most of his time in the clouds, much to the dismay of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and his classmates fly to a concert performance ... and again, Ricky's mind takes off and suspects some criminal conspiracy is happening. Reluctantly helped by the best friend of Sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device he was) and others trying to get to solve the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skill 1000 hours of flight simulator experience turns out to be handy when prompted to save the day in an exciting movie! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos play in a family movie. And watching the DVD talks seemed to have been in great fun. I totally liked the Junior Pilot; charming and good-natured performance, funny storylines and real; a sense of enjoyment and total stupidity. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a fun family movie, you could do a lot worse than buying this movie.
