No, this isn't Ed Wood. "Angora Love" is the last silent film by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The End of the Era! In the 1920s, Laurel & Hardy left a real footprint on the silent genre of the film with films that are still popular and are watched and broadcast regularly, this day. It is a pity that this film is not among the best. The film's premise is good and good. This time, the boys get in touch with the goat, which of course will lead them into trouble and some cheerful situations for us. At the same time, it is extremely stupid and absolutely incredible to watch the boys do comedies with the goat. Most jokes in the movie still work well, but the movie never gets real or unforgettable. Comedy and story sometimes seem to be missing and is mostly too simple and predictable. Of course he's still good and fun to watch fans, but he's still a little disappointed with the last silent Laurel & Hardy. br /> <br/> 7/10
