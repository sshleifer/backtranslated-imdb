The film begins with a promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Pohanka, but as the film progresses, both boys have together less scenes. This slows the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very powerful performance in his early scenes. When left on the boat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When it comes from man to man who asks for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really wonders if it's a comedy or not. Watching the children's birthday party through the fence fence is another moving moment. As another mentioned reviewer I was also worried about the big dog who choked chicken bones! Once Spanky and Buckwheat are in the house of Marshall Valianta, Spanky tend to interact mainly with adults, and children's chemistry is basically lost. <br /> <br /> Old South South / Huck Finn doesn't mean much for this plot, except the kids get a big piece of doors. Ralph Morgan is the most intriguing adult, but the other roles don't have much to do with them. Louise Beavers handles some funny moments with Yankee soldier at the end. Demons aren't enough villains and lovers aren't intense enough. Yet I think it is worth seeing if you are an enthusiast of our gang, if for no other reason, that special curiosity of the whole piece. I give her seven stars, because, even if it's not a great movie, it has been me all the time and curiously what happens next.
