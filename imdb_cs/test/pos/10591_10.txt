This movie is just amazing. It's so good. Although skating and other assemblies are played out, comedy is amazing. Raab and Brandon Dicamillo themselves are cheerful. There will be times when you can't breathe so much laughter. In addition, there are scenes you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. That's one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
