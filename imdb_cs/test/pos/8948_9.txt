I saw it in preview and it didn't seem to be published in the US. However, it was one of the more enjoyable comedies. It is a rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The storyline gets a little out of hand in the third act, but the characters are very fun and unforgettable. Acting is great overboard. Of course it will be overlooked at the junction of blockbusters, it is a film worth looking at. I know I'll try to capture it again in theaters and / or buy a video.
