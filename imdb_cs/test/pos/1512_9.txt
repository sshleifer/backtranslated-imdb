Fulci is one of my favorite Italian directors. He is also a very good storyteller who blends horror, supernatural and psychedelic motives well. This film was indeed his last great story before he ordered such disappointment as "Voices from the Surrounding". The story is simple as Fulci himself, the horror director, plays. After years of filming splashes and movies, Fulci seems to be beginning to suffer from a disorder in which he starts to hallucinate that people are defeated. He decided to see a psychiatrist who made things worse by persuading Fulci to kill people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used gore scenes from several shots at the same time. I don't believe these movies he was driving but certainly produced. Some of these films are "Burial Ground" by Fulci, "The Secret The Murders Secret" and I can't remember the rest of the movies. Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and I watched it many times. Sadly, Fulci didn't get a chance to direct it, but after that it's a great movie and I recommend it to every Fulc fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
