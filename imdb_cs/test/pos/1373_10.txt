People seem to be expecting a citizen of Kane! The planet is a B-monster movie and as such it is good fun and quite different to enjoy. The director has something to offer - he is not so sure if any of the actors is. As for the effects? Â£ 8000 is not a lot of budget.I effects for one would happily recommend this trip to a science fiction head or someone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously. If yes? Watch 3 colors blue instead. I noticed one survey that said Alien was torn away. Like Alien, he didn't pull things out. Best on film? Director. The worst thing about the movie? Cast. Maybe it's time for the director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. Meanwhile - great. At least you're trying to do something.
