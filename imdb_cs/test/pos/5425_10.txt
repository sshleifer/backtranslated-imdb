Richard Condie is a Canadian miracle and one that should be shared with the world. Whether it's routine routine work like "Getting Started" and "Snit" nominated for an Oscar through "The Apprentice" and digitally "La Salla", Condie is a prized local hero. But no single work gives a sign of his career as "The Big Snit". And did I mention he was nominated for an Oscar? Darn tootin '. "The Big Snit", albeit a clearly dated bearer of news from the 1980s (short revolves around the Cold War-esquire nuclear annihilation, but don't worry? It's hilarious as hell), carries more meaning, as do most of Condie's work in an underrated manner. While the planet is running away from Armageddon, a couple of bicker over the annoying habits of others (in Condie's true fashion, hacksaws furniture while she shakes her eyes literally). And don't forget to watch it again and again. Condie loads this boy with countless visual gags and unforgettable phrases. <br /> <br /> I strongly support this incredible piece of animation. In Canada, it is usually seen in the National Film Council movie, which includes other star shorts (including colleague Winnipegger Cordell Barker is equally funny "The Cat Came Back"). Americans will just have to dig a little deeper, but keep it? The reward is worth the effort.
