Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller, which has Clint Eastwood to play a true service agent Frank Horrigan, who wits wits with a clever psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game involving the protection of the President. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) is in contact with Horrigan and teases the agent with discouraging remarks about his abilities, as well as protecting past secret service presidents. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) is trying to keep Horrigan grounded; but he is strong in stopping Leary from performing his assassination threats. Very good FX and fast pace keeps the chart. Eastwood and Malkovich are excellent. Russo has a way to get your attention. Rounding this strong cast is Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
