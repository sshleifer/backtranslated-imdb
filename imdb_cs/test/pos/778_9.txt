At the Tribeca Film Festival, I captured the first screening of driving lessons. Rupert Grint shows he can act around Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as a groundbreaking mother. Julie Walters is cheerful as Dame Evie Walton, with her mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film will be captured by an American distributor so everyone can see it. This film is not just about driving lessons, but about life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to listen to his groundbreaking mother and vicar's father and want to live his own life. It's an amazing movie from an amazing director who took his own life and put it on the screen so everyone can see it, and anyone who can have it.
