The last days is the best gay movie of the gay genre. Most movies carry funny stories, one night stands and don't forget the infamous baseball teams? The last days actually contain male affection for a kiss in the dark, and quite graphical material that wondered if the movie was a blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The film's emotional journey is what puts it above the rest of the genre. Not until this movie did I see the story of such intense passion and love and torture it can bring. I think when people cry during movies, they should be defeated, but I recalled several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I recommend to every homosexual to see this movie, and if you have a friend, thank you ...
