This is a bizarre strangeness directed by a guy who edited "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Chuck Conners performs cheerfully above-average performance as the owner of a road "wax" museum that our lost teenagers crumble near. Wax figures look "real", one of the teen points. Heh, heh, heh ... Not so much a slasher movie as a strange mixture of psychological horror and old-fashioned "House of Wax" - a stylish terror. I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this.
