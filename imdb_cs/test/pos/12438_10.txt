After a long run in the West End, this charming movie re-occupied Margaret Rutherford as Miss Whitchurch's director in this financially successful 1950s adaptation. All interior shots were held at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The exterior scenes were filmed in place at a public girls' school near Liss, Hampshire. During the 12-week shooting, both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell stayed in a nearby hotel and often attended school in the evening, where they would like to enjoy the company of real school mistresses. The movie screenplay contains only two original lines from the original game that lead and support actors are in good shape and you can feel compassionate only for their troubles, especially in the final scenes.
