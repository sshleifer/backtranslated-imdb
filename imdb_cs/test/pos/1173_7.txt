with two old friends. I've always enjoyed Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films, and their teamwork is, of course, always worth watching and often cheerful. Personally, I am not looking at this film as a cheerful category, it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of two major actors and romantic 1960s comedies. Brent Spiner can actually steal the show when it comes to laughter as an arrogant and tyrannical Cruise director. Gloria DeHaven proves that older women can remain extremely attractive.
