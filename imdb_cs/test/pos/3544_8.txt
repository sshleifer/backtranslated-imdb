I guess several upscale movie directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some nights in the 80s during Cannes or another film festival and one said, "Hey guys, let's make a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world-class aria Well ... it's kind of a job It is clear that someone was smart enough to choose the best recordings of selected arias, such as Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lay on the floor, you're just listening DVD, you have more than money.Not every director succeeded but more than not, and the movie seems to be improving with every tracking over the years.My favorite is the love duet of love from Die Todt Statd; A feast for the eyes, but her husband singing to her, the wife of his ghost, is incredibly beautiful with the love music of the other only Otello and Desdemona's "Gia nella Notte Densa" in all opera Could the film be better, sure what it couldn't be, but it's well worth looking especially at you in a hyper-romantic mood.
