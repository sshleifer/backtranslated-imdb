SPOILERS Edgar Rice's famous character, Burroughs, has been adapted thousands of times for a screen where thirst is extinguished, especially during the 1930s and 1940s by Hollywood. Its producers have made Tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters. A few years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey man and it is more natural, more wild and more descending Tarzan, who is giving away here. Hudson deftly avoids the clich√©s you usually give to Tarzan, such as his famous scream or his friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by Hollwood, but we are also far from the film set used for his stories. The film was partly made in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film presents two obvious parts: the first, which takes place in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes and is considered his master. But he ignores his true origin. Second in England, where Tarzan discovers English society. Ian Holm embodies the connection between the two, and Hudson avoids all that might fall into a ridiculous film through a clever scenario. Indeed, Holm teaches Lambert the basic rules of conduct so that he behaves correctly in English society and the result works. In addition, in the second part, nobody ever laughs at Tarzan and he is really honored. As for the end, it's a bitter and happy ending. Happy, because Tarzan returns to the jungle and again meets his adoptive close relatives. But also bitter, because this home means the Greystoke line will not be secured and will be doomed to disappear ... Christophe Lambert will find his first (and last?) Great role here. Sadly, she will never achieve her performance in this movie and will play in bad and insipid action movies. However, as I said earlier, the clever scenario, the performance of rare quality, some formidable scenery (both jungle and English country and we get a wonderful movie. Is it also an excellent reading from the popular novel.
