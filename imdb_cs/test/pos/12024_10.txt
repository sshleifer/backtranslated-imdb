Dan Finnerty and Dan Band are so-o-o-o-o-good, they must be seen to believe. Does anyone out there have a copy of Bravo for sale? If you have an upcoming release, let us know. I checked the Bravo site, but no future performances by the tastiest choreographers, Dan Band, are scheduled for the future. What great energy they radiate when they are pampered by the cute American-boy attitude, which is based on the butch sensitivity that is wrapped in sequins and tears, so both men and women fall in love with them. I hope that enough people can influence the forces that are in Bravo to bring the show back to our lives, like semi-special.
