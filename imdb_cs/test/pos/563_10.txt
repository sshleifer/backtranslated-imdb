Very good movie. Very good documentary. Very Good To See Those Pest Detectors humiliated and identified as bigots, narcissistic, heartless pigs that their parents, the community and the environment have raised as. I lower my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being into some 911 commission or investigation? We need its integrity, perseverance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting against the rigged game, which is world politics and big business. All animals come out at night - sluts, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, donated. One day a real rain comes and cleans all these dirt from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drop of the real rain. The people who control this country are animals. He must drown. I'm just shocked. Walking at night is a scary business. Intangible howling and giggling is the detectives' murder Sunday morning. Pat McGuinness's brilliant spotlight looks terribly catchy, terribly guilty, and ready for just and terrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It is extremely satisfying in a world where strikers play. seeing justice and seeing every narcissist criminal drown as poor human rats are. <br /> <br /> How do you feel about being a railroad, a nasty, serpentine finger of the law? What is the feeling that you have your rigged prosecution, your rigged confession, your rigged detective work, what it was? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it twists like a knife that is pathetic, one look at your eyes.
