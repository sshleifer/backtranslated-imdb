It was a rare experience to see "Checking Out". I touched the characters, I laughed a lot in the amazing script and I was deeply moved by the real emotions that this set of casts and especially Peter Falk portrayed. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, where he talks about his life experiences, is so deep that he is at the highest level of his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life. Best Performance Academy. He is the perfect actor who set out on this film alone. The scenario offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, gift for dialogue and cheerful situations that made me laugh in the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to all who want to enjoy quality storytelling greatly acted.
