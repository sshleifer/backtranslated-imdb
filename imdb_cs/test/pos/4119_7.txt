George Saunders is a counterfeiter who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing the guard in the process. A few months later the salesman sells counterfeit books for big money. One of the counterfeits is sold to a working Nazi man. He is not satisfied that the Nazi frontman insists that his money be returned to him, while an investigator working for one of the other cheated clients appears. In an effort to stay safe, the middle-aged woman starts to play against each other and prepares a meeting in the New York Public Library between the different parties, but as people begin to die, the library is locked up and more murders (and maybe some rare book distortions) seem close. Complex Mysterious Murder is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is affiliated with Richard Denning and cast solid support players) If the bug is a movie too complicated with charts with land and all quite a lot out for themselves. Layers of theft, counterfeiting, murder and intrigue in the war (that was 1942) are almost too many for a short period of 70 minutes. It's still a nice little movie with darkness and a sense of inevitable destruction for some characters who clearly call it one of the first film noirs. Until Denning appears, we are down among some charming thieves that we like, maybe even more than a hero, but his clear word and deed will not have a completely happy ending and they know it, even when fighting it. A good little movie worth looking for.
