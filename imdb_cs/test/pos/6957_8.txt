This is a subtle, undervalued movie and Rip Torn, known as he is, is a seriously undervalued actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and the beauty of Vermont's northeastern kingdom! I was lucky to have grown up in VT in the 1940s and '50s and still lived there when Irasburg Incident took place. I haven't seen the _Stranger in the Kingdom, the Craven / Mosher-based collaboration (and another Mosher novel), but this film inspired me to watch.
