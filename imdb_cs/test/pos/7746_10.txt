When I first saw him, I totally fell in love with "Living in a great way"! Reason # 1 is because I love ADORE and I'm a huge GENE KELLY fan. He was an amazing dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his very handsome appearance and his sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was such a gentleman. This film featured his amazing talent for playing. I also liked Marie MacDonald. It was my first time I ever saw or knew about her, and this excellent movie also made me a fan. Actually, the whole cast in this movie was nice and great. Humor between valet, "Everette Hannover Smythe" and father, Mr. Morgan; Mrs. Morgan is the courtroom of humor, and especially Grandma Morgan's immediate link to, and concern for "LEO GOGARTY." And the Gene number "FIDO AND ME" is lovely. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend that someone see this movie. It will truly remain dear to your heart forever. Or at least it must be mine. And you'll fall in love with GENE again. I rate it as my favorite GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and owned many of his movies. They are part of my daily routine! So believe me, if I tell you, you'll love this movie! Watch it and enjoy !!
