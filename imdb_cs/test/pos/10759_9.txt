this is an adaptation of Dirk Wittenborn, which I have not read. young Finn Earl lives with her Mom Liz (Diane Lane) in the cramped lower East of New York. she dreams of joining her anthropological father studying a wild tribe in South America. Liz has a friend and makes coke. when she catches her having coke for her, one of her customers (Liz is a legitimate masseuse) rich Mr. Osborne throws her out in return for being a full-time masseuse in his huge mansion in New Jersey. They're being driven in a limousine there, in the back seat with stuffed clothes and trousers. (This and several low-cut scenes are the only exploitation of Mrs. Lane. Some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry she had to do everything in "unfaithful" to make a list. Talent in her little finger than Streep, Roberts and Sally Fields are doing all their careers and the time when she was given the appropriate reward.) When she arrives, Finn and Osbornes Bryce join together and have a new age with her new girlfriend, Maya's granddaughter. Meanwhile, Liz joins AA and enters Doctor AA. Miraculously cleans up immediately. But Finn does a lot of drugs with his new friends along with sex. Bryce looks OK, but jealous when Osborne takes Finn to a hot air balloon race instead of him, which leads to a tragedy. The genius of the story (and the movie) is that cut from the Fierce violent acts of the dirty rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano fighters. It is somewhat unlikely when Liz discovers what happens to her son, merely requires action from Osborne and does not care for her, nor does she modify it in the Thelma and Louise style. There are elements of Gothic romance with the revelation of the village idiot. Also they make almost no land or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Laneina Pearl Kantrowitz in "A Walk on the Moon" had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and felt trapped. That's in the book, but not in the movie. Yet these are minor flaws. The film will be full 12/31/05 over a year after the original release date, and I just couldn't wait. I saw a lot of Red Carpet moments in the theater that I saw the movie on, with almost the entire cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q Director Dunne said she's out of the movie. I know she promised she wouldn't be there, but I came out of town and it would be so exciting to see her personally. The movie is the ultimate Best Picture contender, how to play ??? Sutherland was pretty good, just like the boy who played Finn. As always, Lane was spectacular, but I only remember one or two emotional scenes when they catch Finn with drugs, "allow him to be with your mother and son" and Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". She should be eating better with a support actress, but it didn't work that way. if they don't give her the "body of work".
