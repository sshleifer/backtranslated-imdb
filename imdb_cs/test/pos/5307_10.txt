This is a great movie and was immediately put into my top ten (trust me I know movies!). It's one of the movies that really thinks about you, not necessarily about the storyline, but about yourself! The film is about fifteen years old boy (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to the juvenile hall where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl is growing slowly, and finally, Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his peers, but when he approaches Lelands's motive, he learns that he has to deal with his own problems. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and must be seen with great music pixies and fantastic scores! Bach!
