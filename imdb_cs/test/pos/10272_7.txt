The film is visually charming, but the plot is particularly interesting. The film captures the zigzag process of exploring the innermost feeling of the main actor. Max, who lives for two years in New York and intends to marry a girl he met there, returns to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend, who still enjoys, but eventually finds out who he loves actually. is her best friend. Nonlinear narration so many flashbacks and each part is expressed quite well. Three Women Max has encountered a symbol of something we need to pursue, even though they may not have a clear picture of basic motivations. His fianc√©e is the one he needs, rather than the one he loves, and hence completely free from loyalty we can see. He does not give him love but only stability. True love can also not be found in his relationship with a former girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him to escape - many very romantic things he has done for her, but almost nothing seems appropriate. The one who truly revives Max's life is actually her best friend. The equilibrium at the end is not the same as the initial equilibrium, because Max understood much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the search procedure more complex. It's not as brilliant as "Pulp Fiction," but things seem more natural. Max is not the only person who is undergoing transformation, and in fact Roman Bohringer is also interesting. Good cinematography also makes her, and Monica Bellucci looks very beautiful. A good comment of today's love and undoubtedly a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br />
