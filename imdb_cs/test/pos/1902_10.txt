Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation film to come, but it's definitely one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre, which has caused a dramatic shift between the films that have been created before it, unlike the films that followed. It wasn't necessarily annoying or moving black culture movie, and it's a struggle to overcome problems like racism or something as important as it was, but it was the story of one bad guy fighting "whitey" with his hot kung fu army Yippee. It was to blame for pleasure, great fun and best to watch with friends. (10 of 10)
