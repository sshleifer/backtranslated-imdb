Despite what his critics follow, I enjoyed immensely what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg did scary hard edges stuff before, winning Oscars, being at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is a lightweight, commercial, fluffy, Steve's day at Midway if you want. I'm not generally a Zeta-Jones fan, but I have to admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. It's the end of the upcoming trequel shouts and I'll be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes George and Brad and Matt Parlay over Clooney's kicks in Lago di Como as they cheat some rich bad guy over and over. If we tolerated 3 installments of the Lord of the Rings, will I ask if we can once more flood Clooney's lid of salt and pepper?
