The thief is one of those thrilling thrillers in which viewers are guessing to the end who is the villain. The tension comes from the first scene, when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and the film has cleverly hidden tracks so you can guess who is the jewel thief. The story shows that Dev Anand (Vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. You get a shock of 1000 watts when you finally recognize a villain. There's a lot of surprise and lots of fish, but there's time for romance and six melodious songs that sang Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. This movie was also talked about videos of their songs. Consider the teasing and contradictory campaign in Asman Ke Neech. Or blocking Dev Anand's way when Tanuja and her friends went to Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechar. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are are in beautiful Sikkim. Or a wonderful dance of Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to this Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this movie for any reason. Able to play Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and directed by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's Younger Brother) is one of the most popular Hindu movies ever made.
