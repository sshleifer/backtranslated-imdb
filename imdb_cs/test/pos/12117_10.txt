This is an excellent anime movie. He is well animated, has a good plot and very good music. I understand that some may consider it a bit long, but I think it's a good length and animation is a good traditional anime. THREE FEATURES: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterfully. For example, a doubling body adds to the sinister tone of film in all of these places. The design of Tenkai is also good, the way he looks like a monk, and at the end of the scene the armor he wears. The old man Andou is on the ground and has a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the film. Sanpei, Satsuma Shinobi, who infiltrated the Tenkais clan, will save Jiros's life twice. He remains behind most of the movie though, but he is indeed one of the movie's heroes. PLOT: The story is good. It is traditional without being original. Interesting is the historical time in which it is being restored, the restoration of the Meiji. Tenkai sought treasure to restore the shogunate while Jiro found himself using it to help anti-aircraft forces overthrow the shogunate. "Hamlet" feels it. There's also a sweet irony that if Tenkai didn't get Jira to become a shinobi, I don't think he could eventually kill him (maybe with weapons, but not with arms). The whole death story makes it mostly dark, but there are a few light moments when we see some of Jiros' childhood memories. All in all, it is a good, dark, complex plot. MUSIC: For example, the introductory theme is very good with electric guitar and drums. Sometimes they use what I consider to be taiko drums in this piece, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of good music. Like the one who played when they travel to Iga shinobi. I believe that this piece is called "Numata" and has an incredible flute in it. The flute could be a flute but rather a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The end of the theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The vocals are beautiful, as well as the song in general. ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> Animation, though good, is not perfect, and the blood that leads the characters sometimes happens to look orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. One example of a nice transition is when Jiro and Iga shinobi are running, the background is sunset and music is playing. The transition is simple but effective and also has a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think the storyline, animation, music and characters make it one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
