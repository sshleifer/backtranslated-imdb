Since the excellent Prime Suspect series reaches fourth, there is no loss of momentum, which is in itself a great success. Primary Suspect IV: Lost Child has a solid support cast that we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her when she is on the screen. The search for a lost child of the title is led by the CID superintendent Jane Tennison to the main suspect, who turns out to be a convicted pedophile who now lives a single mother and her two young daughters. Insight into the work of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series, but may be too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are handled brilliantly. holding the camera rammed us right into the center of excitement and there is a grasp of tension during the climactic siege. Overall, this is another spectacular police procedural drama.
