This movie is great, I really liked it. This film is about a cat of a mum called Dutchess and her 3 kittens. Dutchess and kittens love music. They have to practice piano every day. Edgar tries to kidnap a Dutch woman and her kittens trying to sleep with them. But he failed. A Dutch woman meets a cat named Thomas O Mail. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. Cats break into a song. Everyone wants to be a cat with the song. Thomas likes music like other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I love cats!
