It is a cut over other genre films: truly exciting, intelligent, brilliantly performing and visually stunning. Yes, a conspiracy can be confusing - but that is what makes it such a blow. Watch it twice if you can. When you learn how to find out, you'll find it's almost as much as when you first saw it. Do not be discouraged by the fact that this film comes from Korea, a country that is not very well known to most Western listeners. Although there are elements of film that are culturally specific, the basic themes are too versatile - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of these are greatly processed by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the leading character. Also worth mentioning is Yum Jung-ah, who as a stepmother brings deeply scary and disturbing performance. Although it has its frightening moments, it's not really a horror movie, as most people would imagine. It is rather a psychological tense story with a secret element. He will grab you from the beginning and keep you arguing to the end - and maybe even behind him!
