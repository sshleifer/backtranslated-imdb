Gilmore Girls is a cheerful show with never-ending sarcasm, wit and charm. At the age of 16, Lorelai gave birth to Gilmore Rory Gilmore. She left her parents' house and got a job. Now Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that envies many mothers and daughters. They're best friends. Girls have extensive knowledge of movies and TV shows and cite them all the time. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton (high-ranking high school), so she must reluctantly turn to her parents. They are happy to give them money, but in exchange, Rory must come to dinner with them every Friday night. I highly recommend this show. I love it!
