"What is his name?" "Loudon." "What about Loudon?" "Clearly." That gag still gets me twenty years after the release of the movie. Back then I loved the movie and I love it today. I had to watch it several times during the day and when I recently bought a DVD, I could still remember some of the dialogs. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, has not committed a young woman trapped for a crime. When he gets out, he decides to seek revenge. Griffin Dunne (what happened to him?), plays a lawyer for his fiance's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law will ask Loudon to take Nikki out of prison to the bus station and make sure he gets on the bus as part of the anticipated new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are a lot of complications, some funny dialogue and some incredibly silly but funny scenes along the way. Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie, which until I was able to follow with subtitles to make one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (that is, only 8/10) but on the other hand I can't imagine doing it in her normal voice. This film shows Madonna's comic page (maybe missing today) and is really funny in the role. Dunne is a great foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as a sincere fianc√©e. Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think it's a great movie and it will happily sit and watch it 100 times more.
