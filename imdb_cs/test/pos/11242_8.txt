I can't say this show is perfect. Maybe all the previous commentators remember the old Tuesday 10:30, which caught the childish humor of Butch Elvira Curt ("There's a 747 shuttle!"). Oh, the glory that you need to press any button on the remote to change it. The face, comedy can't pull the Showcase and create a comedy genius of truly Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, he's gonna try. This show is by far one of the best original shows. However, none of the following find themselves laughing at the obvious "players" who show off their stupidity when picking up girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Dumb" Girls - Obviously they don't realize they are just like girls on show. Careless. Jump on meat, you can call a bitch tomorrow and get his name. He looks good, must be popular and kind. HAHAHAHA !!! But you will never do it! Nobody would ... if he knew it was happening <br /> <br /> b) Unsocial guys who think women like nice boys. to make your primary fury cook. Watch more closely, most of the time they will be shot down. They call stupid crap. c) Girls with Respect for Each Other - Obviously, your separate distinctly feminine species are caught up in real-world situations badly. Nobody's playing. Women are not objects, they cannot play because they are all very faithful angels who go to clubs to talk to each other politely without fear of the boys trying to pick them up. Oh wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> Like EVERYONE will say this show is not fun, and that it will teach you nothing, I have to take the opposite side. The show is very good at the details of how relationships work for both men and women. The way they think and the way they think each other and the social hierarchy. His funny to see and hear guys make absolutely stupid comments on things women say ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, are we talking tonight?"). <br /> <br /> In addition, the club. A place where people want to have fun and have a good time. No matter who you are, you go to the club to get to someone or to alert them. The boys are testing their game and picking up the girls. The girls go there to flirt with the boys and find the one that sweeps her best. Lighten up! <br /> <br /> If you're a guy, learn something about the different approaches and different effects they have. If you're a girl, you'll learn what these "studs" girls really think, and learn to distinguish them from real guys. Next time, when you split up with one of those guns, remember that it's not for him because you're stupid and he thought he was the biggest guy when you were absolutely clear all the time.
