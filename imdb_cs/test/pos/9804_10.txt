I'm surprised that so many viewers have found no symbolism in the movie ..... that's what made the movie an incredible work of art! The story is about the saddest content a movie might have, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen because it is needed for your own imagination and the brilliance of the story. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, the message is there. A stepfather kills a younger brother. The older brother created a story about how the car flies as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who would argue why he should lie to his children with the story. The answer is to me because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children, or that he blocked them and replaced his memory of a terrible event with the idea that his brother is flying to safety. I have read some reviews that are convinced that he is the only child and that he created a younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he has suffered. While this is an interesting idea - I love the imagination I have come up with. I don't think he would lie to his own children about having a little brother. But I find it plausible to lie about the death of his little brother. However, I like the idea of ​​ending much better than the idea that the film had no symbolism at all. There are many different options you can have in the movie, but if you take the film to face value ..... two brothers make a car that flies to escape an offensive stepfather - you missed the brilliance. The fact that I was able to see the fine news in the script was what made the movie so incredible. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ...... You will be amazed by the genius in the film. The only other movie I've seen so close in symbolism and fine news is Pleasantville ..... but that's a comment for the next movie!
