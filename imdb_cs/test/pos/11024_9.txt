Niagara, Niagara is a stunning and heartbreaking story about two outsiders, Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney performs a fantastic performance when Marcy suffers from Tourette's Sydrom as the film approaches. This film is not very optimistic and it is very difficult emotional but very romantic. It's hard to explain, but to see it and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it.
