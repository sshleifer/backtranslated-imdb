I described this film as surprising ... that is true in many ways. Subject material (black accused), characters (people who expect to be stereotyped, often show abnormal attitudes during the film), production ... his time (1949). The only possible spoilers are sometimes kitschy dialogue and occasional high moral attitudes. But when it happens when you don't plan to watch a movie, you may find yourself like me - staying up in the middle of the night just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
