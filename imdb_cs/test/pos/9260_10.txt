After a roughly 7 year rocky journey to NBC, it was decided to do just one last Super Install. The series was on the bubble several times because it had no numbers that would consider it a blocking television clock. It always had a substantial, hard core of hard corps of followers. It was almost as if the series called "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON STREET" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to abolish it, but too small to get the case of "Angry Ravings". <br /> <br /> During an uncertain possession on Friday evening, they presented some of the best and most daring art dramas. I said it artistically, artistically !! But please remember that we mean Artistic, but not just false, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct sermons. <br /> <br /> When it was finally certain it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE"; This super episode was prepared as this 2 hours for TV Movie. Looking at the history of all past seasons and a show of regular characters, the production team went out and gave us what turned out to be a great posting. <br /> <br /> OUR STORY? ?????. When we join the story, we find that the Baltimore murder commanding officer, Lieutenant Al Giardello, "pulled a pin", left work, then. But 'G' is not yet ready to retire. Instead of a rocking chair and a fishing rod, we find that Al runs for the mayor of 'Charm City'. While you are in a city where the campaign stops and exits, former detective Lieutenant takes kata killer. Alive, but in a comatose state, he is taken to a hospital. The news is spreading quickly and as if it were officially summoned, we will find all the Baltimore Unit detectives we have seen at the show and offered them their services and help. There is a great gathering of all these former and present gumshoes as they pitch and watch every leadership and opportunity to lead. Producer has found a way to deal with those who died earlier in filing their story. They were able to answer several long-standing questions and present them to those who did not disappoint them. The whole story ends the show in a totally satisfying and original way. But at least for the time being we'll leave it as "secret". <br /> <br /> When wrapping everything in a neat, small package, this TV movie will definitely get our approval. As for the classification "HOMICIDE MOVIE", we must give it A or A +, even. But regardless of grade, it wasn't as high as a typical weekly episode.
