"Distant" is a slice of Turkish life that follows the secular activities of two adult cousins; one photographer and the other unemployed. There is no doubt that the author of Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work with considerable talent. This small foreign minimalist art is so full of empty fillings and so without a story or something interesting or provocative that it would probably only touch the most precious dedicated cinematographic and mainstream viewers. Personally, I quickly became bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself swiftly passing empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, conspiracy development and denouement. "Remote" is a very nicely done piece of esotericism. (B-)
