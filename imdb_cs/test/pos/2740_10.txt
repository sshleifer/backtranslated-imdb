My dad had this movie like an 8mm reel. I loved it when he pulled out the projector, the wall strap, and played Gerald McBoing Boing. The thought of a child who sounded was fascinating. Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as an autist. Doctors would ask me questions about my son, for example, "How does he communicate with you?" I'd like to keep a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his teachers how my son sees it as a world. it did not contain sound until the mid-1970s. I think I was lucky enough to experience Gerald McBoing Boing's experiences and sounds in 1972.
