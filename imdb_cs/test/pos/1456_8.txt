The man with the golden arm was one of three great films around the same time dealing with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and Hatful of Rain. But I think these three are the best. Maybe if Otto Preminger shot the thing in real Chicago instead of the obvious studio sets, the movie could be better. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for a seat. It's the only mistake I found in the movie. He was treated in jail and wanted a new jazz drummer. But many people conspire against him. First of all, Bob Strauss, who wants to give it back, especially since there are several heavy-weight players in the city. He uses several methods to return Sinatra's services. Second, Darren McGavin is a local dealer who wants Sinatra to join the customer again and again. And finally, Eleanor Parker his indifferent wife, who works on contacts to beat everyone just to keep him around. Sinatra might have won for this if she hadn't won in the Support Actor category in the From Here to Eternity category for a few years and that Marty was such a respected film this year. His scenes going through a tight closure in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken. Eleanor Parker doesn't get enough credit for his role. It's really something like a crazy crazy woman who wants Sinatra to tie her up, no matter what the price. If she wasn't nominated for Interrupted Melody that year, she could be nominated for it. 1955 marked the highest point of her career. Darren McGavin received his first real warning as a very serious drug salesman. Its performance is guaranteed to pass through your body. Your family.
