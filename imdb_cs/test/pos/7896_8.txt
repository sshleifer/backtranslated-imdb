Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his son a hippie friend after an argument. Panic-stricken, he retreats to the bar, and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a vocal-mouth, angry, bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become. Bill inadvertently allows Joe to find out he's just killed a hippie. And that's just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film of unlikely friendship. The bond between two men, one in the background of a white collar, the other in the background of a blue collar. Bill & Joe have one thing in common, they are disgusted at how the mad world has become. Dennis Patrick & Peter Boyle both introduced a very realistic depiction of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this "pre-Rocky" effort, directing this low-budget gem with the same subtlety as the movie with a $ 100 million budget. The scenario is loaded with excellent character development and a very elegant, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The scenario falls asleep about 3/4 of the way through, but wakes up just in time to refute the peak. This film also has a very early and non-inspirational performance by 24-year-old Susan Sarandon, when Bill's daughter Melissa, along with her friend hippie Frank, portrayed very modestly Patrick Mc Dermott. One could be only grateful that he was killed early in the film. Despite several shortcomings, it is one of those forgotten films of the 1970s that should not be. Although "Joe" is very dated to today's standards, chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is now entirely relevant and it's glue that holds the film together.
