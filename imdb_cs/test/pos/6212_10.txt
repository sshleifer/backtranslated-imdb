Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the later part of the '80s, when it came out. My dad recorded it for me and I watched him all the time until I noticed Oprah that I had stretched it and my heart was torn. I'd like to know if or where I can get it. I was looking for it. I believe they also came out with Supercarrier 2. It wasn't that great first, but I'd like to have everyone if I could find them. I don't think it would be a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with lots of actions, but it had a somewhat conspiracy of love. The actors / actresses in the movie were great. It helped me to understand that this is not just a human world, but it is also a world of women, and many women can do the same things, if not more than what a person can do and women deserve great respect for their duties.
