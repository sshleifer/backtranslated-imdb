The bride at Chucky starts late at night, when officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station and steals the remains of the Chucky doll back from all the horror movies in the joke props. in the original children's play (1988). He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) snaps Bailey's throat and takes the remains back to his trailer. There Tiffany stitches and Chucky clamps (voiced by Brad Dourif) reunite and use the book "voodoo for dummies" to bring him back to murderous life. The thing doesn't go because Tiffany hoped Chucky wouldn't eventually become the man of his dreams, so he locks him into a play pen that Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany bathes, Chucky escapes, electrically kills her, and uses this book to return her to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. They don't even want to be trapped in plastic bodies and have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet needed to put their spirits back into human bodies. Nick Stabile's neighbor Tiffany Jesse and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), both on the run from corrupt Uncle Jade Police Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do well ... \ t Yu I Love The Bride Of Chucky. The Don Mancini screenplay is great fun, very fast moving, very fun and links lots of other horror movies with good affection. From the opening sequence, where we see Jason Voorhees' hockey mask from the 13th year, Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare's razor blade on Elm Street and Michael Myers mask from Halloween. The clips used by Bride of Frankenstein (1935), when they virtually restore the same scene. The bride of Chucky is never taken seriously, which is just as good, there is a lot of one liner, her own reference gags that Scream (1996) made trends a few years earlier and does not seem to be afraid of having fun on the horror genre in general. I love the scene when Jesse & Jade have a romantic conversation clich√© that Chucky hears and makes funny derogatory comments and gestures. That doesn't mean there's no goddamn good movie because she's definitely there. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a real sense of fun, both human and plastic sets of characters are sympathetic and brilliant, because each couple suffers from their own sets of domestic problems that would probably cause traces of the corpses they leave. Technically Bride Chucky is great for most parts & she has this big Polish budget about it & for about $ 25 million I should hope. All I can say is that some of Kevin Yagher's puppet effects are a little stiff and unconvincing, I can't even recall the CGI scenes in Bride of Chucky. Fortunately, the film does not neglect blood and neck with a cold slit throat, nails burst into one's face probably in honor of Hellraiser (1987), people stabbed on glass shards, someone is bloody destroyed by a huge truck, torn lip piercing and various stabs and shots. Acting is pretty good and Dourif as Chucky is very funny when she pours one liner out. I also like the scene with Tiffany at the start & find her very sexy when she is wearing all the fetish gear, can't I be sure? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total fun from start to finish, great humor and horror on the same scale and for just 85 minutes, it will never become boring or boring. My personal favorite, watch it as soon as possible!
