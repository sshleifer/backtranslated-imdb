One of the most modest, depressing yet open documents. I watched it for a while. There is no narrative or story to tell, just a "third eye" camera that tracks the period around two heroin addicted couples in New York. Watching firing on the floors of public sinks then "cleans" the needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it is too much and you have to pause for a breath. Everyone who is currently recovering from alcohol / drug use should watch it when they crave - it really shows you what you can get back! After seeing it it's a wonder how anyone could even try this medicine to start with. The only thing he needed was to watch the end tell where these people are today. Judging by what is stated in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They mentioned that they wanted to be better and quit, but the only end of their habits was to stop dying. This is definitely not for all viewers. I found myself as if I was watching a car accident - after I started watching it, I couldn't turn it off. I had to look with the dark / morbid fascination of what is inside the lives of these addicts.
