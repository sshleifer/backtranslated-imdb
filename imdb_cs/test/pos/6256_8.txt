Okay, this wasn't the biggest horror I've ever seen in my life. Although it's a lower budget, it's a pretty decent movie. Monsters are unique and believable. Damn, they're even so scary in the scenes that they're causing them a trigger on this poor family. Although, when you finally get to the monsters altogether, you really think "WTF!" The little pieces are after them?! " The only part that really disturbed me is when they * sniffed * kittens! No pussy, noooooo, why? Seriously, if you're looking for hardcore violence and gore, it's not a movie for you. Go Rent Hills have eyes or something along those lines. If you have small children, I wouldn't recommend watching it with them; they would probably give them trolls' nightmares in their room.
