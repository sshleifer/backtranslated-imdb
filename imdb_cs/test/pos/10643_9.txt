After reading the biography of the last Russian Tsar (Nicholas II) and his inability to secure military support, I decided to try this movie. I watched him with an absolutely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except his reputation). These are the things that impressed me the most. 1) Shots of battleships and soldiers used as accessories. More than once, I stopped thinking, "if it happened at this time and place, 80% of them would be computer generated". 2) Realism in it. From meat infested with worms to shots of a sailor with a candle and the legend "Killed for a Bowl of Soup", this film does not give concessions to PC cause (which fortunately has not yet been invented). br /> <br /> 3) Slow descent into the frenzy of the Odessa Steps sequence. From the first shot, when a man without limbs appears, you get the idea that something might be wrong; Since the overall shots are composed, but in the end you will feel comfortable in your surroundings. Then amputation occurs, and people begin to fall into dramatic positions. However, the shots compose ... until the Cossacks appear on the scene and incredible shots appear. This scene is easily priced for admission. 4) The fact that this film is 100% pure propaganda. When Rambo then fought in Afghanistan, he also had something to do with "propaganda"; just another kind. Overall: a film that was somewhat marked by slow narration. However, Metropolis, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this film are perfect examples of inventive, nervous movies that are still remembered for their merits. Indeed, modern movies are boring and repetitive.
