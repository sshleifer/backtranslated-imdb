I saw this movie on television in the sixties and it still stands for brilliant performances like DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I wasn't on duty, but my brother had a helicopter instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were in place in their roles. The only thing missing in "The D. I." is the language. In 1958 they couldn't use film profanity yet, but Jack Webb came across pretty damn hard without him. I think it's his best role ever. He was quite stiff at Dragnet, but I would admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but only used it to work in "The D. I." You will never forget the funeral of dead fleas! The romantic part was just to stretch the film, but did not interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but in his career this movie never overcame. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was John Wayne's television. In some Dragnet episodes he brought it a bit, but not in "The D. I." After forty years, I was hoping the film could be on the line of "Full Metal Jacket" and others; and did it!
