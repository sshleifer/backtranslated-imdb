The most amazing movie I've ever seen. I haven't read the program and accidentally came across a movie. I thought it was a real document and I felt I was sick of what I saw. I just found out that it was a movie after it was finished and I looked at the site for more information on the "punishment park" in the US. from Europe. I have to admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and before I realized it really didn't happen.
