Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border and shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am a Colombian and French American, sick and tired of seeing Colombia so depressed and unconsciously depicted by Hollywood and others. How many of you realize that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the US) or that it has a lively film and television industry (- said nothing about Ugly Betty) that it is capital , Bogota (Pop. 9 Million) is the "world capital of the book", or that this beautiful city is hosting the largest international festival LARGEST? I hope Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will visit Bogota one day to find out how truly amazing it is and focus on Bogotá's cultural vitality and diversity instead of myopically producing films such as Maria Full of Grace from which Joshua Marston benefited greatly (for this amazing film) without ever thinking-over about ontological damage his film would help keep on "unjustly tainted image" of Colombia. /> <br /> -When you enjoy Bluff at least! -Oh, and thanks to IMDb for your invaluable / great job !!!
