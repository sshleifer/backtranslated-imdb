I tend to fall into and out of love with anime because the more you look, the more you notice lots of shows, there are only bad copies of several gems or rehash old patterns. But once in a while one of the real gems comes and its originality just throws you away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes a translation into an animated show is somewhat badly done and does not take advantage of the animation's over static drawing. In fact, Haruhi is based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animation, great acting, great music and a complete and well-taught story. Watch that you won't be disappointed, and I would recommend watching it on the air to make it work much better.
