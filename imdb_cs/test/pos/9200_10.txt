I usually don't comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to write a comment on Las Vegas. Naturally, here in the UK we have about 2/3 in the third season, and although I managed to look at the last series of season 3 (by other means), I'm still glued every Friday at 9pm. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of Season 1, I've been a big fan of the show and have all three seasons on DVD, yes I can't wait for the start of Season 4 in October. So why do I like this show so much, I have to agree with the last poster. Caan, I know one person can't create a team, but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan or maybe it was the other way around, I read that producers considered Martin Sheen for Ed Deline .... Do'h no way !! ! I also agree that Caan's character is still very soft, I also preferred hard to take no sh * t Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in Season 1 and 2 seems to have softened. As I said no man would do the team alone, and of course the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda contribute well, even outside cast members like Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch, who can stand 6 or 7 times during the season, as well as if they were in every episode from day. This show has everything, drama, action, tension, laughter, romance, glitz, glamor and great times celebrities who often play alone. Many may disagree, but this is one of the best shows on digital television and I hope it may take a long time after season 4.
