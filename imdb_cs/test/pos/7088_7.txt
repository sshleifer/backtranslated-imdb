The DVD jacket in which this movie came up describes it as "uplifting and funny." These are not the words I would choose - not a long shot. I would choose a word like "sombre", sometimes even "depressed". Which doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's actually a pretty good movie, featuring good performances from the leaders, with enough uncertainty about what happens in the end that you'll watch. Uncertainty comes from the structure of the film - it seems to revolve around Ellen's memories of the mother's slow death to cancer, as DA talks. So from the beginning we know that something suspicious happened in the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen - a somewhat angry daughter who had to give up her life and work in New York to return home to take care of her sick mother. she develops through film - moreso than any other character - when she learns to deal with the strengths and weaknesses of her parents, her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is quite interesting. The pain was effective because the secluded husband did not separate in a steadfast manner, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what was happening to his wife, and seeking out the way out of her in various ways., Finally, Meryl Streep as Kate suffering cancer, was very convincing in this role and tried to live what was left in her life, in the most complete possible possible way, and then to deal with anger In some ways, watching a family business with such a crisis reminded me of a bit of "ordinary people," although the film was much less emotionally intense. So not "uplifting and humorous" (with all due respect to who wrote the synopsis on the DVD jacket), but very good in his own way. 7/10
