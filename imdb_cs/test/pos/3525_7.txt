Taking our suggestions from Delwoodance and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jeff Lieberman's Just Before Dawn couldn't offer much new in conspiracy? Manic Stems And Kills A Group Of Campers ??? but he can still be an effective shock thanks to the director's handy material handling, great use of amazing scenery, even greater use of women in finished pants, tense synthetic score by Brad Fiedel, and a clever turn to the end (though the one that should be obvious to those who be careful). <br /> <br /> Thanks to the solid performances of his capable cast, including Oscar George Kennedy's winner as Roy McLean's Forest Guard? too often missing in this kind of fare. The film also offers a pretty creepy maniac (who giggles like Dick Dastardly's Mutley dog ​​and uses the ugly jagged machete to kill), and brings some very imaginative sequences that help to lift him up over many of his contemporaries: a topless woman (a gratuitous nudity box well and really tickled ) in the lake he discovers that the hand that groped underwater does not belong to his friend; a short-sighted figure radiates with his friend's girlfriend (as a joke) without knowing that the one who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the murderer.
