I have to say that THIS IS THE BEST FILM I AM A LIST. I know this site is just a negative rating, but for once I would like to be a good person who gives the world the best movie a good overview. I find the film extremely fun and has the perfect combination of everything. I feel all the emotions when I look at it and I can't get it. sound tracks brilliant. I love it, I understand why people don't love it as much as I do, but I don't understand how people might hate it. The film is 100% brilliant. Blurry is amazing. I never realized that Aussie movies could be so good, and I never realized I could watch one movie, so many times in a single day without ruining it. I think everyone should see whether a person feels what life is like in the younger days, or whether he should find out what is right for you when you reach the end of 12.
