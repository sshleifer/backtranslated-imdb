This young filmmaker has the talent to capture his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scenarios. The concept of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well done and the soundtrack is very good. The decision to release the film in twelve parts online brings the director to fascinate each episode enough to invest the viewer in buying each upcoming episode. I wish all films had such a commitment to keep their audience entertaining during their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
