Key West, for too short a time, was a "TV meeting" for my family. I'd stop at Red Lobster and pick up Party Tray for the night he was. The irony was that I was working for Fox Affiliate at the time, and everyone at the station was angry when the show didn't resume. Everyone in this cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who couldn't identify with "mundane" dreaming of being a Key West writer? Jennifer Tilly has always been remarkable (and is one of HECK's Texas Hold'em players). You can still find a pilot episode on YouTube. He wants them to send the hurricane. The episode itself was to win the Emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.
