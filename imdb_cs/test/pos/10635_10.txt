Michael Haneke is known for his distracting movies as "Funny Games". This time Elfriede Jelineks received "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably her best work so far. Jelinek always writes about abusive behavior in families and especially about the repression of women in the patriarchal society. Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), even sleeping in the same bed (already a hint of something special). Erika is bullying her students the same way she is being bullied by her mother and secretly watching porn movies and playing with sadomasochistic games. The student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her but refuses to sleep with him. He wants to play with him, but he's disgusted. He reluctantly follows his rules, which means disaster for both. Haneke has a very clear picture language, everything is filmed in an almost spartan way, so the complex characters and story are improved. /> <br /> People who don't know Austria very well may not realize the importance of setting this story. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers like Thomas Bernhard) suffer from cold and randomness in Austrian families and society. Austrians (at least Viennese people) are often unable to articulate their pains, desires, suppress their emotions, so there is often no real love, affection and closeness in their families. In a society where it is more important for society to show the perfect fa√ßade (even if it means protecting crimes in families because Erik and her mother are protecting Walter's rape of Erika to avoid scandal), it is probably not a wonder that Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother, it is just a time when they share emotions, is very violent and unloving at all. Erika will replace her hidden emotions with the desire for violence to finally release some feelings. But she has no one who really wants to talk about her emotions, so she must finally stab to alleviate her inner pain. Isabelle Huppert shows her best career in her career (as well as most other actresses). With an expressionless face often in her face you can see only a hint of emotion, a quick smile, a gaze with eyes. Finally, her pain is masterfully exposed without a single tear. Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also perform in strong performance, but the film belongs to Huppert.
