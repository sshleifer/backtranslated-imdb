Extremely adorable Suzy Delair plays sculptor performer obsessed with theater. Her husband and escort, played by Bernard Blier, is a comic but jealous man. When he finds out in a less-favored way that his flashy wife has planned to meet a miserly old businessman with the intention of continuing her career, she loses all control and threatens entrepreneurs with murder. Now, at this point, I have to stop describing the film to you because it skates on thin ice with its twists, revelations, ambiguities, and tensions that would indicate that it might endanger. I'm not sure how good or bad this is for this French police process based on the song and dance community, though it is certainly interesting that what we know is who didn't do it. We just don't know who did it. The story depends on the progress of subsequent tracks, where the ideal alibis fails and where the creations and scams that break up are carefully formed. Interestingly, this is a thrilling film in which tension is generated despite the knowledge that would traditionally be thought too early. Quay of the Goldsmiths is Henri-Georges Clouzot's least dark movie. It's not nearly as ominous as the shocking Les Diaboliques, just as tragic as stunning wages or scary like Le Corbeau. Perhaps this is due to the vibration of dance halls and theatrical scenes in the 1940s, all of which act as the environment of this criminal criminal. Clouzot understands and approves his characters, even nastier with more other movies. Where perhaps he had a sense of bullying women in Les Diabolique or truck drivers who fall to the level of risking terrible death to avoid disappearing life in the Fear of Wages, there is no necessity to support or negotiate a part of the filmmaker because they are characters who they have made direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this more settled film have scenes and moments that admire us, even the harsh, cold detective who is played by Louis Jouvet, who is worried about his young adoptive son in the midst of all the problems and despair that will ever happen in his life. with a hat drop. There is humor and fearless sexiness, the latter mostly on the part of Delair, that neutralize pressure to the degree. Clouzot practiced his craft quietly, patiently, until he made his relentless later films, in which he would not allow his viewers to pardon the tension.
