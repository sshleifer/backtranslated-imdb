As Roger Corman said in an interview, low budget filmmaking allows filmmakers to seize the chances of unpredictable ideas. Well, it would be hard to find a movie that could be successful when George Barry "Death Bed: A Bed That Eat". The film has a back story, and it's interesting. I'll get rid of any details so you can hear them yourself if you look at it. Suffice it to say that the name of a furniture item has an insatiable hunger, consuming a careless with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims, such as acid. "Dead Bed" is a scary, scary little flick that plays its absurd premise by going beyond the usual schlock fare range. It takes its dream world so that I could take it seriously. It is really strange and unusual horror. Blowing into exploitative ingredients - there's some tasty dollops of female nudity - and yet it's art, albeit art with totally sloping sensitivity. Special effects are not too bad for a movie with a microscopic budget, and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. Casting is just as ignorant as you could imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends an appropriate amount of gravity as an artist / narrator, and one important point of interest is to see one familiar face at hand: the future "Boy Meets the World" Father William Russ! This movie might not even find a small cult following that wouldn't have been if it hadn't been the pirate copies that had made the rounds; this must certainly be seen as one example where such a practice eventually ended up with film - even though the exposition lasted years before it succeeded. <br /> <br /> If you feel like really bizarre obscure things, "Dead Bed" can be exactly what you remembered. <br/> 7/10
