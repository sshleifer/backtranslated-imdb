I've been waiting for this movie for many years! The best part is that he lives up to my visions! This is a must-have for all Tenacious D or real Jack Black fans. It's so great to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a real story, but who cares. D is the biggest band in the world! I had a movie soundtrack last week and listened non-stop. To see the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby. We both met Jack and Kyle after two different Tenacious D concerts and we also saw them when they traveled with Weezer. We left the concert after the concert. No one can show his show! Long live D !!! : D
