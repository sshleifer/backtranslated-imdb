If you asked me to choose the best movies, this movie would be on a short list along with Streetcar Named Desire. I imagine I will find some more that qualify, but Kramer vs. Kramer is an excellent exercise in naturalism. So his very satisfying experience at this level: just watching the amazing, sounding performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and especially Justin Henry's child. One of the best children's performances ever. But also the fact that I watch is very satisfying, because its so thoroughly worked-out story always forgets my own problems. She has such a great narrative ride. As soon as you hold Kramer and Kramer and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son, he didn't tell him anything more than to appear herself - you're still watching everything turn out fine. And even if you know how it turns out, every moment of the ride just sounds so good that it's a pleasure to watch it over and over again. Do not be mistaken - Kramer vs Kramer is not easy fun: his very realistic depiction of the effects of divorce on all involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born outside the conversation between Benton and Benton) and Hoffman, who was going through the divorce at that time, he wrote, executed and performed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what a great story is. Simply put, the perfect movie.
