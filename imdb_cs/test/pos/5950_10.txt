This is the latest record of a long series of films with French agent O.S.S. 117 (French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s, and spawned at least eight films (none of which were ever published in the US). "O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies" is a fresh little comedy that shouldn't ... repeat NO, take it too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (Morroco makes a stand in Egypt) to learn about a long lost friend. What follows is the standard James Bond / Inspector Cloussou kind of antics. Although our man is something obvious xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, it is considered a pure farce (as I said, don't take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of a rough language and a cartoon of violence, it's basically alright for older children (12 and over). As mentioned in the subject, just sit, go through the popcorn and just enjoy.
