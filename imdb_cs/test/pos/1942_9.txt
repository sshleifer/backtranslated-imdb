The way Crispin Glovers plays (and not only him) is huge. You really want to believe him because his body language and performance are perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary piece of personality that makes this film a cult. Like Feck, what role does Dennis Hopper play. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported and that's exactly what I think is difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience it with serious tones and family maths. I really enjoyed watching. I saw it a month ago, but if you like 80's, it's the one you have to see. I didn't know it before.
