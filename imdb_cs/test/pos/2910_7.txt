I had the pleasure of seeing this movie when I was 10 years old (interested in Egyptology). I know there are subtle mistakes in art and costumes, but all this is the best film ever seen with the 18th Dynasty. The film merely presents Mike Walteri's "The Egyptian" on the plot. Much of the text never got into the movie because we have to take into account the length of the run. <br /> <br /> The musical score of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Performances follow. The late Edmond Purdom gave excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents around their childhood years. He says he holds himself up, has the best education available, and lets himself feel that he is an emotionally distant person, given his upbringing and his high intellect. Jean Simmons is fine as a humble pub; honest loving and honest. Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent, she is Babylonian well. It's not so obvious in the movie, why Sinhue is so madly obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Her right name. In Sinhue's book, she enjoys her bodily fruit and gets her revenge soon to conspire by letting Nefer Nefera's drugged body with "House of the Dead" workers. Gene Tierney as Baketaten is brilliant! When he tells Sinhue that he is a pharoah, he seems to be absorbed (in his weakness). It is intense, brilliant and cool beautiful. Michael Wilding is heartily tragic in his mission to know all his only God. I believe we follow Ankhnaten through the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A look at that time that had a pre-messiah feeling that Ankhnaten is a profession. Did his monotheism affect the Jewish people? Note Psalm 104 and other Egyptian images in Psalms? Mr. Peter Ustinov has provided the alter ego Sinhue. He is wise on the street and cunning who survived. Excellent performance as always. Mature never considered much of his acting personally, his Horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who eventually kills more than one person in Sinhue's quest for strength, (Walteri felt the end The Egyptian is confusing because Sinhue's personality is changing too easily He has a living son (Toth dies in a novel), power is passed over half Bakeraten's sister, world wisdom now and the grip of international affairs. He was able. <br /> <br /> Sinhue gives everything up, including his son's future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and a major mistake Again in the script! <br /> <br /> Once again, the appearance of the film, the color, most of the costumes (Nefera Nefera Nefera's gold dress was too high because it is richer than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'll be watching the movie again easily. PS I know you're sure you know that Horemheb didn't beat Ankhnaten directly, but I couldn't resist this fact.
