Under the assured direction of F. Gary Gray, "Italian work" never loses its grip when it's cool and fun. Although the material is overworked and average, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfactorily good. The tone might be much harder to take into consideration the plot of the murder revenge, but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone of light with good humor, elegant dialogues, and vibrant music. It is a pleasure to see that these people, who are evil, form a great bond and stick so that they can join each other in deception and murder without forgetting the fun. This one is 7/10.
