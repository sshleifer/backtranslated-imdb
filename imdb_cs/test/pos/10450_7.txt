I have always liked this film and I am glad that it is finally available on DVD, so viewers will see what I have told them all these years. The story is about a high school virgin Gary (Lawrence Monoson) who works as a delivery pizzeria and hangs up with her friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary notices Karen (Diane Franklin), who is a new girl at school and gives her a ride one morning and by this time she is completely in love. That night she sees Rick and Karen at the party, and now she's jealous of her best friend, but she doesn't tell anyone his real feelings. SPOILER ALERT ***** Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his grandmothers, but Gary apologizes so Rick can't get Karen alone. But one night, Rick Gary boasts of nailing her on the football field, and Gary gets angry. A few days later, in the school library, Gary sees Rick and Karen arguing and asking Karen what's wrong. She tells him she's pregnant and that Rick fired her. Gary helps her by taking her to her grandmothers and paying for her abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen how she really feels about her, and she seems to be willing to feel her feelings, but later at her birthday party she goes to Karen and Rick again. Gary is leaving without the girl! This film ends with a more realistic version of life. No matter how nice you are, you don't necessarily get a girl. This film was directed by Boaz Davidson who would go for it to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things with this movie. First he made sure that there was a lot of gratuitous nudity, so it was negotiable for young men who usually go to these movies. Second, he had the film end up with young Gary without Karen and I think the men in the audience may be concerned that it's okay, no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is stupid and exploitative, but it's funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the film as sexy Carmela. Moritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you might remember her in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Like "Fast Times in Ridgemont High," this music has a very good soundtrack and the songs played reflect what's happening in the story. At the heart of this film are two very good performances by Monoson and Franklin. Franklin needs nudity, but still expresses the grief of a young girl who gets to landfill at a crucial time. She is always a good actress and her natural magic is evident in this film. But this is still Monoson's story and you can't help but feel it. When the movie is over, its performance will stay with you. It's a hard work that makes it more than just teen sex comedy. Even with the stupid scenarios of adolescents trying to have sex, this film still manages to achieve what it wants. An unappreciated comedy hits the bullseye.
