Every story has a lesson for young and old. But what more I have to say can spoil the future story. But I believe what I have to say is for everyone; just for one particular episode: Soldier and Death. Well ... of all the stories that stand out for me is "Soldier and Death" because it was a moment in my life I realized life was a terminal. I am not joking. The broadcast was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I'll always remember it. Until today I didn't remember his name but the new synopsis. (May 15, 1988) It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am a living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind them of adults ... I write it with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor of my own age - died today. It reminded me of the many lessons I learned in life. So I write it as a reminder to the young and the old ... no one is immune to what's in store for us. I hate to say that death will happen, but this story was the first time I saw death as a bad thing; But part of life was literally in this story. I can't help it. It was a life moment for me that changed and would always be. And for that ... I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in life until the day you died, and your memorial Muppet Show ) and I thank Brian Henson for keeping the Workshop alive !!! Honestly, thank you to all your co-workers, editors and trainees. The stage is just a podium / And the show is just a show / But the imagination creates Magic / That Forever the world will know. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And for all who doubt me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
