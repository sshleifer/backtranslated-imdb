I enjoyed this movie, it just could have been much better. I was expecting more action than what I got ... which was more comedy than anything. It is true that it was serious in the games and had a good battle scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and has to train another, his sister is going through a heavy breakup, but she is being watched by a vampire of all things. It is true that this vampire is pretty nice and not sucking blood. So that's all that really is besides the plot of another vampire for certain royal vampires to get the ultimate power. Some of the problems with this film are that his plot went back and forth, and the film had a very uneven flow, and it seemed to push the genres a bit. One-minute action, another pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there is good action, comedy was worthy of laughter or two and Jackie Chan is rather energetic in appearance or two. This film probably needed more development in some areas, such as a villain who is basically not explored. So for a movie with a few good fights and a laugh or two it's pretty good ... though why was it rated R? I saw the things we made, it's PG-13, which is much worse than this.
