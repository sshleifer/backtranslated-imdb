The box in my video store is why I rented it. It looked cold from the guys in the middle, so of course I had to try. I was pleasantly surprised when I was actually watching it as an "Evil Dead" fan. Swedish producers have to be fans, as well as a lot of links in this masterpiece. The criminal is trying to break into the house Evil Ed has edited the movies that finally made him angry and says "groovy" when he looks at his weapon as Bruce Campbell as he finishes his hand in the Evil Dead 2 chain. the whole house and office in the movie. They're not just a spoof of Evil Dead because there's a Gremlin-style puppet monster who's cusses on Ed in his fridge. My personal favorite is to chase his wife around the house and say, "I'll come to see you to help Barbra", which in case you don't know is Barry's main line in the "Night of the Living Dead". This film has almost all the good conspiracy, great characters, funny things (puppet Gremlin), scary things (demon doctor), excellent effects (exploding head) and a fair amount of female nudity. I gave it only 9 because its kind slow before Ed goes insanely but its well worth waiting. So if you like "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned above, you have to rent and watch freind, and if you do, you try "Brain Dead" because I hear it's like this master part. <br /> <br />
