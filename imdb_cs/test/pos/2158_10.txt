Yes, we really have a winner - the winner in the best dumb-action-movie! The only reason I decided to vote for this movie is that it is so incredibly bad that it actually becomes funny. "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, vampire hunters (vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently) and his mission to kill the last remaining Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie features one of the most amazing scenes I've ever seen in life. Not to mention really bad firearms. When people are shot in this movie, blood splatters - thick as ketchup everywhere, it makes the film so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. The camera's constant shaking is what worries me most during the battle scenes. I suppose it is to create an "action effect", although in my opinion it does not influence. It's totally ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are done very badly. A scene where the dead Vampire leader is thrown out of the roof. When the corpse hits the ground, it bounces like a wobbly rubber doll. The scene where Jack sniffs the ground as he was vision was so lame that I laughed hysterically. Lame music, the scary scenes, the bad playing and the mute silent movie techniques are obviously features that make this movie such a failure. To say that this is a good movie, it would be the same as saying that nuclear bombs are good for people. Obviously, those of you who say this is one of the best action movies have not seen much in their lives. This is basically a Class B vampire action movie that deserves 0/10 but I will give 10/10 just for its ability (to be the farthest action movie I've ever seen) to he laughed and because I can't live without him.
