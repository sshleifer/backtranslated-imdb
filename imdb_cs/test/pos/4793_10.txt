The theme of religion in Buñuel is that a man, like a eater of movies, like an eater of art or a person, can hardly analyze. One can see the satirical Buñuel in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or "L'Age d'Or". He is very hard and effective in his critic, but when you saw it and then you see the movie as "Nazarin", after seeing this work, you start asking your author. And many have questioned what seems to be contradictory to Buñuel, but it is not so much called, I think there is no contradiction in his work, only that Buñuel's religion is very diverse as in films. This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazari who lived a humble, simple life dedicated to God and helped all. He lived in a simple and poor area. There was too Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. Without her violent, macho man will find no sense of her life. He has some resistance to him. On the other side is Andara, one of the cities of prostitutes. Nazario's father was stolen again, accusing Andarin's cousin. Andara hears it and tries to fight with a priest who does not believe in violence without success. That night Andara found out that her cousin was a thief, she stole her fools. Andara fights his cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seek mercy from the priest. Nazario decided to help her because he knew it might be against his church, obviously having some consequences. From there, the Nazario will be a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him and be like him, serve God. <br /> <br /> If Buñuel's sweetest film I have seen so far is too spiritual. It is clear here that the most confused people are that we do not see Buñuel against the power of the Church, we see Buñuel, whose film is about the Church, but not in a typical - and large - satirical way. Although this is not the case, I do not think that the right word is a contradiction, I consider it to be pleasant and well done, and despite such religious questions (as his "Voie Lactée") I found him more like a spiritual film, do not try to touch the Catholic religion in diversity as she touches, and laughs in other movies. "Nazarin" is the father of Nazari and his gaze before God and the same religion, but all this is in the end, analyzed in this man's spiritual life. The other two women are not contrast but equally well two other perspectives of faith. First, we have Beatriz, an abused woman who loses all her faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very sick. Andara, a prostitute who runs justice, was also on her side. In a child's family, only religious women, there is great pain, but faith becomes the Nazario's father when he comes up with nothing to this city. Bless the child, later he says he's okay. The priest wants to go for a walk, but Beatriz and Andara have renewed their faith in life and want to devote their lives to God with Nazari. After several complaints, Father Nazario decided to be with them, discover with some things to the end, how he felt about faith, God, religion, and a person in need, about people who had to ask for charity to survive. This last question must then be listed as one possible explanation for the end of the pineapple. This end we listen to drums (similar to "L'Age d'Or" and Father Nazari, walking on these things when he rejects fruit for the first time and at the end decide to accept it as a symbol of necessity or perhaps in response to his spiritual Meanwhile, the way to be a priest, both women must take their father, Andar for their crime (A beautiful scene where he thanks a man who helps Father Nazari in prison and then a damn man who hit a priest in prison) and Beatriz because he prefers to be his man macho, even though he treats her badly, just because he does not accept that he has fallen in love with a priest, there is perhaps a unique place in the film for church critics - to go against the church, the religion he serves. Father Nazario is the one who is (soft for many, but not for me) a critic for any thing in religion (Father Nazario to help women who are guilty of crime, sin) but Being one of Buñuel's analysis of faith and life, he really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film that is undoubtedly one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if any.
