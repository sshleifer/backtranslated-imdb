It's been many years since I had the privilege to see this movie on TV. I wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two with a fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't realize it, but when I saw this movie, it helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 years old and I thank the Lord for having blossomed beautifully but still has many consequences of being born by an alcoholic mother. Every month, we talk about rehabilitating alcohol and drug addicts, and this sharing has actually made monumental changes in their behavior and is trying to start a new life that is not dependent on drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a copy of VHS or DVD of this movie, or when it appears on TV again. If you weren't in these shoes, you probably never understood its value. Thank you very much.
