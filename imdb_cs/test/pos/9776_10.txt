Once I saw the "Changi" ad in the history channel, I knew I liked it. Fantastically captured the spirit of ANZAC - you would die if you had no friends around you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and everyone brought something different to the story, and Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but were depicted as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just as the Australians did. Direction, screenplay, gameplay and setup have been beautiful, with a clear, easy-to-follow graph. Humor was the key to surviving soldiers and it was great to see that the mini-war series actually has some humor that is usually difficult to do without insulting people. From what I read about Changi PoW soldiers, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years of those Australian, British, New Zealand, American, and Dutch men who have spent there. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
