HAND CONTRACTS definitely rank ten on a scale from one to proper, in no small scale to the John Woo Master Direction, along with the outstanding Kat Cinematography: some are just for rent; There are times when this border becomes a film of an art house. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung do for the bad guys you can't help but love for hate. Tien is especially good as the worst of the bad. It's a role to reverse what I didn't think I had ever seen (Tien normally played the hero and in fact, with his mustache, I'm not even recognizing him initially). Sammo's goofy "buck teeth" make the unflinching character seem even more flawed; that he also becomes an experienced martial artist, making him even less sympathetic - in a criminal you love to hate the kind of trip. His battle scene choreography is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early and late in going) as a blacksmith, and I believe I actually saw Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as leadership is nothing less than spectacular.
