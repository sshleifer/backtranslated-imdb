This film gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotions - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never disappoints us and does a great job here again. And so are the other principles. One key feature, a doctor / father playing John Hurd, adds (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some events are too coincidental to be real, but I apologized with the knowledge that this is a fairy tale and fantasy. My wife and I liked the movie. It's nice to watch people who risk loving the enemy. One man who left the theater near us said to his wife, "Now it's a way to wage war!" I think you'll see what it means when you watch the Italian occupiers of this beautiful Greek island.
