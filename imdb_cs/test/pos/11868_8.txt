One night, Randy bartender (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from her jealous friend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel to his home. But Utah is coming back and wants Randy to open a safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly he attacked - Utah is dead. Then ... ... I'd rather stop here to say so. This is like explaining the story of "Wild Things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the story (written by Stan Seidel, his first and his last work - died in July last year ...) was told from 3 points of view - 3 men who fell on Jewel. Each of them sees her from different eyes - like John Goodman as a detective who gently falls in love with her because she recalls her dead wife ... No wonder the boys are falling on her! Liv Tyler - it's a real gem. She made a great screen shining! She played her role as if she was in her forty noir-thriller. Sweet - but at the same time it was a cold vampa that walks on a dead body and uses a man for its needs. And of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, the Bingo killer - was pretty cool! But over the last 10 minutes, there were too many grotesques for my taste - that weakened the atmosphere. That part started when Paul Reiser (as cousin Randys Carl) put on his leather dress for Jewel. "YMCA" -song didn't fit too much ... ... but "all night at Mc Cool's" is pretty COOL film-noir parody! <br /> <br />
