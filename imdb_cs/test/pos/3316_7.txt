This is a movie that is much more enjoyable than its rating 7 would suggest. In many ways it is like a 50-year-old version of VALLEY OF DOLLS - with a lot of overweight and weakness VALLEY, which was a little polished for the 1959 viewers. to success - although this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (although one of the ladies in the BEST ALL category has Broadway ambitions). The film begins with Hope Lange coming to the company on the first day of work. She is assigned to the hard nail bosses, Joan Crawford, who appears in her first supporting role over the decade. Despite Crawford seems ugly, Lange decided not to get in the job. And over time, she quickly moves from secretary to editor. At the same time, her two new roommates are also trying to move up the ranks - one through the stage and one through the relationship with a rich playboy. Like VALLEY OF DOLLS, they all have their ups and downs (mostly descents), but at the end of the movie there is some hope that at least some of them will do it - battered and bruised. In this film, men are mostly pigs. The only person who seems decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so Hope Lange naturally neglects him as a ne'er doing a good ex-boyfriend. As for the boys who played veteran actor Brian Ahern and the others, they are sexist scammers and eventually you understand how Crawford has become so bitter and ugly. This film has everything - adultery, premarital sex, abortion, and so on, and it's definitely NOT an artistic triumph. Thanks to the excellent production values ​​and juicy scenario, it is a pleasure to watch. Don't wait for Shakespeare !!
