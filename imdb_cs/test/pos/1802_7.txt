I'm glad Cage changed his name from Coppola and got that part on his own. Light, without deep thought, but a cute piece about the opposites attracting - though her parents are still hippies .... It captures the voice of the early 80s - whining the valley and funk on the other side. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
