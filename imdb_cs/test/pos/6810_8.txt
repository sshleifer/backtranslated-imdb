I saw this 1997 movie because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked the best in this film, mainly because of his hairstyle and the luxurious wardrobe that was flattering to him. <br /> <br /> As the plot went on, I realized that film was more than just a fun or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story concerned a series of serial killers and attempts to enforce the right to investigate the circle and to bring the members to court. There was adequate tension, and I believe that violence was necessary to bring the story to the viewer. At the end of the movie, I was shocked to learn that the film was a true description of the terrible murders that occurred in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his front lady were depicting real FBI agents who resolved the disappearance of many young women and contributed to ring fears. I believe the film is worth it because it informs the public about the dangers and possibilities of a criminal element.
