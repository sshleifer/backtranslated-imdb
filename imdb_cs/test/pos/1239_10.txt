Why would I say that? Because when the movie was over, I was in a good mood. So many people call in the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe they have learned to act in the sixth sense, you must be very new in your career. He won an emmy for Best Actor in a comedy series before he made Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky has learned to store snow just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was merry. What I think is how some other comments about this film claim that there are no unforgettable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... Waaaambulance? Am I not defeated? Have you ever seen an adult scream I'm not defeated before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and it made sense in some way Disney was. Something related to life and, of course, to every child film that tries to do what's over, but I didn't care once. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it. Do so. You will like it.
