The story takes place in the streets of Sao Paoulo, Brazil, where a young boy named Pixote grows up alone without parents. Pixote, who was in a mess and without any direction, got into childhood asylum with other street adolescents. Behind the closed doors are terrible things inside the staff and inside the children's groups. And there is one last trigger that gets a place to blow up, the last incident that Pixote and his friends decide to break free and escape. From here, the road begins to be overwhelmed by strong friendships, torn friendships, love and hate, criminal activities and simple beach cooling, talking about things, something like you and I sometimes do. I think this film is perfect in many ways, because it touches you on many levels, that's what I was doing. A document-like style used to render Pixote and its surroundings seems to be more realistic, and actors who are truly street children and living similar lives help humanity seem more natural. She also has a social note about child abuse, but I think what makes the film so big is that the pressure is on the story and not on political views. The last scene I find the best piece of the movie will hit me like something I haven't seen. So full of emotion, yet so unsentimental, makes this film a true, credible, unbearable, unforgettable story. A real heartbreaking work that is underestimated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
