Gary Cooper and the Marshal change their identity because they both agree that Cooper will be more effective in facing outlaws. Notable in this film are costumes, both Marshal and Steve Cochran, who is evil. Cochran wears his arms back, probably being able to crossdraw. The movie starts quite excitingly with Bill Hickok's show. Ruth Roman, looking very nice, is a marshal fiancee. There's a lot of action, never a boring moment, but you have to concentrate because the story is a little complicated. Good entertainment.
