This director and director Rutger Hauer, a short film, was based on a short story by Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> You'll see life in 10 minutes of movie length. "Harry" uncovers his long-standing fascination with the room he is constantly passing through in his youth. When we return to the city many years later, he discovers that he has rented the same room. <br /> <br /> In black and white, textures are highlighted in this delicate story. The voice of "Harry" dragged you into his world. Gentle, tight performance of Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Great soundtrack of Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At this point, it's hard to see this movie because it's only available on DVD Region 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus song. But it has to be on the re-released DVD "The Hitcher" - another tight but very different performance from Hauer! <br /> <br /> Check out this movie if you can!
