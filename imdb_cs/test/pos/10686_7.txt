In this film, astronauts sent to explore the newly discovered planet have to deal with several dilemmas, so intelligently. The film approaches this main theme of the theme in a unique way and develops it gradually, even if it can be predicted in advance. Acting is very good, though sometimes stiff. . It can also be somewhat vile and even melodramatic, especially after the topic of the topic reveals itself. Visually, it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year's "2001: Odyssey of Space", and it tends to film date. Some actors continued to play in the 1970 UFO TV show, which is beautifully camping and worth a look at the DVD. Despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic and considering this was 1969, scenes inside the spacecraft cockpit also had a realistic view. (Check out some video technology in the nineties and 2000s in operation!) One thing: I suspect that the love scene has been reduced, but I can't prove it! It would be a distraction anyway. Unlike most science fiction movies, this movie will think about conspiracy, and it's worth a look. I'm glad to have this movie in my video library.
