After seeing this routine of John Leguizam, I finally realized why he was so talented. I enjoy great stage work, and that's the stage work at the best. I can't call it a stand-up routine because Leguizamo is so intense it plays different characters. The only time he breaks a character is that he needs to complete his part in which he does so cold that you can't help but appreciate his talents. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Freak fixed it. For those who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Be sure to check it out. It's one of the routines I've ever seen. Ranks with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
