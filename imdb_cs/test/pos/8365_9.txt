I am a fan of Zhang Yima and finally found this DVD title from Shenzhen bookshelves after a long search in many places. It is a huge departure from the previous work of Zhang Yima, esp in and style. The director himself said it was the first and only time he would try to make a black comedy in China today. You can even say that this work is experimental in nature, compared to its other well known large budgets and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Shot with a hand-held camera and wide-angle lens all over the movie, Quick Tempo Editing and High Energy Performance and Naturalistic Tone will never let you go as soon as you do it from scratch. It is a very realistic description of modern Chinese urbanism that is set in this case in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this film completely. See also the happy portraits by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou. Last Comment: In this movie I find characters like in all the other Zhang Yimou films, they show similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds and up the ante. Let me know your thoughts on this. David Lee
