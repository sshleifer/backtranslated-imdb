For the first time I saw this film in the early 1980s on cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a lot of things I'm sure I missed. However, about a year ago I returned to my life when I started to enjoy it with my son. It's a little young (9) on lots of themes in it, but understands that dancing hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that the end is ironic. Although I can't think about other movies in this genre, it has a separate genius I love. It also makes unique justice to Central Park. Most of the musicals are lost to me, one way or another. "Tommy" was on top and heavy handed in the direction, "Oliver" seemed like controlling the crowd on the silver screen, "The Wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribling, but listening to "failure body" from the hair sounds today as it was in the 1980s, as it was in the sixties ... really timeless.
