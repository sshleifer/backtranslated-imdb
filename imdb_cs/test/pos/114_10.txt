I admire Deep Mehta and this film is a masterpiece. I would recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it is a movie you would like to watch more than once. And believe me, you will still find little meaningful details after multiple observations. <br /> <br /> Characters - with the exception of Grandma - are all very balanced, not black and white. Although you follow the story from the point of view of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. I think the IMDb rating for the movie is too low - probably because of its politically controversial opinion. content.
