Battleship Potemkin is a masterpiece. The direction of Eisenstein is really a sight. The movie ship chronicles dissatisfied <br /> <br /> sailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers. Finally, the sailors finally have enough abuse and are sending officers packed. During this period there was a lack of films in the Soviet Union <br /> <br />. The government wanted their report to reach people to establish a National Film Society and one of its members was Sergei Eisenstein. Films were filmed on miniscule <br /> <br /> budgets and the lack of movie supplies forced Eisentein to be careful <br /> <br /> and selective with the shots he shot. Finally, Eisenstein had <br /> <br /> reused shots to make a full-length picture. <br /> <br /> The most famous action set of pieces in this movie is a lot of <br> /> <br /> talked about the staircase massacre. This scene was fake in bananas and recently in Brian De Palma's Untouchables. If you want to learn film, <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage you to look at the Potemkin battleship. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most important things. <br /> <br /> A +
