I saw it on the German press. Without too much: Most critics seemed very happy. Subsequently, there was applause, which is completely unusual for this species. From my point of view and so far it was the funniest movie of the year. It maintains the charm and wit of the three W + G shorts and is extended with many links to these and other movies. Of course, allusions to the monster and werewolf-movies, especially "The American Werewolf in London", "Jaws", "King Kong" and even "Braindead" / "Dead Alive" by Peter Jackson, but also other genres are obvious. Characterization was better done in "Chicken Run", but the movie had a complete "cast" where it was necessary to introduce. Here you can already know the two main characters. So the new "Wallace and Gromit" -movie is the best when you have already watched the shorts (and liked it), but it also works alone. "Chicken Run" had a more comfortable but also more "narrative" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece holds the crazier and somewhat "isolated" feeling of the W + G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you like cute bunnies, it's a must for you !! !) and because Gromit has something to do and really steals the show (kids also love dogs ... :-)). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual cues in it). The film handles, as well as "Shrek 1 + 2" and "The Incredibles", fulfilling a high level of entertainment for the whole family, with the addition of British and at least a little darker edge to the humor of American animated films. > <br /> Animation is ??? as expected ?? Great, and they loyal to Aardman style, because they do too many digital effects - I realized only a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. Finally, the score works well in the movie, although one of the main themes is definitely being "borrowed" by Randy Edelman's "Dragonheart" score. The bad thing is: It'll probably take another six years from now to see a new animated jewel by Nick Park & ​​Co.
