This is easily the best film version of William Faulkner's fiction I've ever seen, and I've seen some of the most important ones. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, he really captures the feel of Jefferson and Yoknapatawph County. The intruder in the dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it is a clich√©, it would be the jewel of a crown in someone else's career. It beats Harper Lee's good but simplistic To kill Mockingbird fifty feet into the ground (I read it one in ninth grade, and that is exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play the lead role in Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the only most common character in all Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a logic man, not an emotion (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchamp can be the most important of all Faulkner black characters (he plays a significant role in one of Faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); Unlike all other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to worship every white man. She has pride, and many in the white population find it a viable quality in a black man. One day Lucas finds himself over a dead white man with a recently fired pistol in his possession. Most of the Jeffersonians and surrounding areas do not see the need for judgment, and everyone is sure that Beauchamp will be lynched before the evening, or at least the next day because the murder and arrest took place on Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to help Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems to be open and closed. But his young nephew Chick Mallison, because Lucas has helped him in the past, is willing to help him. As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as clearly as this. Hollywood movies rarely pursue a black population, but instead prefer to move them into service roles. If you are an African-American actor, you can give up and accept this role either as a mum, a maid, a servant or a porter because that's the only way you work. One of the most memorable non-porter roles ever played by black actor Lucas Beauchamp is in Intruder at Dust. And Beauchamp, as I described above, has no stereotypical character and could have been hard to accept for viewers. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical, and kind. A recent arthouse hit far from the sky is a great example. Beauchamp is a bit of a jerk and is very stubborn. Though maybe a little less than in the novel, it's not a kind of stereotype. It's a complex human being. Juano Hernandez plays extremely well Beauchamp. I haven't seen the movie in a while, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 movie, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as the film adaptation of Faulkner's The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the movie. I would also like to praise Claude Jarman Jr. who has a big role in Chick Mallison. The novel takes place from his perspective and is a conventional hero of the image. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, telling, for example, events that happened decades or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The City) perfectly. He would appear in another big role next year in underestimating the John Ford Rio Grande movie. Clarence Brown's only other film I saw is National Velvet, a pretty different picture than the Intruder in Dust. His work is exceptional; I really have to admit him as a perfect capture of Faulkner. Other famous Faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic (Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I like in spite of it) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I do not like the coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner). The only other one that really does well according to its source material is Big Douglas Sirk's 1958 shooting Pylon (really another kind of Faulkner novel entirely), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
