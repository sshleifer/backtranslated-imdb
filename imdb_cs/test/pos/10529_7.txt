This BBC version of Agatha Christie's book shows the pitfalls of following the book too tightly. Christie's books tend to move at moderate, sometimes even quiet pace, and "Evans" is the one he definitely does. It also has a solid school of reds to fool the plot. This version is extremely faithful to the book, resulting in a very slow story. As a Christie fan I gave him 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to get through the story without action. I appreciate some of the tightening charts that the BBC has done much more for its later Christie productions. Finally, this film is rushed by the delight, highlighted by Francesca Annis's brass singing, which brings considerable charisma to her role and plays very well James Warwick.
