I don't think the world is ready for this movie. I know I wasn't. I was expecting a standard low-budget schlock using potboiler. Instead, I got the most intelligent rework of Shakespeare by Peter Greenaway's "Prosper's Books". This should become the definitive version of Romeo And Juliet. Of course it won't. But that is the loss of the world.
