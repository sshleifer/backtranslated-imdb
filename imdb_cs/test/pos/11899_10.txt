Finally I saw El Padrino, from what I see, it's an incredible movie, and a lot of action Damian Chapa is a good director, but I have to admit I love his Best performance. I've seen the backstage that a lady named King has modified, has to go back to school and learn how to edit. However, El Padrino is a pure action epic. Why can't the majority of people who manage the films that interest you, what a conspiracy? I am so glad to see someone I know is a really great actor who has also become a great director. I'm one of those people who love to see artists who do it. <br /> <br /> BS
