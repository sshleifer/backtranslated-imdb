I don't know if it was the directors' intention to make sure the sky is almost always sunny and beautiful in this movie. Perhaps it is a romantic image that many Americans have at the time this movie is set, as it is in the middle of the war, Macy has returned from war (His neighbor asks, "Hey, is it true you have Fritz there?" ")") and trying to get through his life, but one day he gets a new pair of glasses (that is, a name) and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation turns out to be one of the angry anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern might be wrapped in it. funny as it is not Jewish in this movie, but accusations.It is also historically accurate, as trade unionists of this time wrapped themselves up in the flags of America and God, and Macy is constantly shocked to come to a "meeting." Bringing this timeframe to today is in contrast, in 2005 it was completely reversed when average citizens who accepted patriotism and religion as their unifying support for the Republican Party and the search organized work as part of left-wing "non-patriotic" America. <br /> <br /> A great picture to watch if you care to see a friendly, shy and humble Macy (played beautifully by him) catch in the bloodshed of race and hatred in the mid 40's. years in New York. Hard, emotionally charged movie.
