I have this movie on a collection of cheap B-movies. It's not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to recognize for the first few minutes. Initially it looked like a typical haunted house movie, and feels very much like the precursor of Clue, Murder Death, House on Haunted Hill, etc. About half an hour into a movie, a story It has a really interesting twist - and it goes from the clich√©s of melodrama to something completely different, and far more fun than I originally thought. <br /> <br /> Look at it, it's a lot of fun, although long clips and wider shots (and almost lack of music scores) make it a bit creaky. today's standards.
