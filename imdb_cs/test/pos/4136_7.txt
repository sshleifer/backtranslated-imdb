It would be unreasonable to judge that a narrative or document is more authentic than the other. Both formats have a basic form of fiction and are never a real reflection of reality, because producers try to reconstruct and tell stories in their perspectives. Since both formats usually leave some questions unresolved due to the "complexity of subplots" and the time of the screen, it denies viewers the opportunity to open debates and further explore and construct the true truth. Taking into account the inability of the viewer to evaluate the resources (eg Comparison with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, history can be biased through narrative and documentary film. For most people, a documentary can be seen to be truer usually with the actual testimonies of participants and footage in real life. However, these images are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present to viewers their version of realism. Paul McCartney tries to create Buddy Holly in The Real Buddy Holly Story, as family and friends remembered and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. The testimony may be distorted because memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make Buddy a legend. The documentary edited the film version and covered other events such as 3 Crickets members and that Buddy's music was actually heard outside the US at that time (he had to travel the world!). However, it did not go into a deep discussion of what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative discussions can be left out of the document because producers are trying to introduce Buddy that the world should keep in mind. In the end, we are not able to build the whole truth because we are confining ourselves to past "realities" documented by us. Personally, I prefer narrative film because it provides rich visual images that help us reunite with the collective memory of that time. This gives viewers a more constructive structure to the story, and this leads to better memory retention for the audience when the story tells. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their views and opinions on certain issues. In Buddy Holly Story, racial issues have been highlighted, and viewers can address these issues in the context of current situations. Movie visitors are constantly trying to return to certain emotions and use these emotions while watching the movie. viewers may decide to establish personal relationships with the meanings the film producer wants to bring. In most stories, people are more likely to selectively remember the struggles, the inspiration, and the way the story ends. Through Buddy Holly Story, we remember Buddy and Cricket fighting, how Maria was the source of encouragement, and that Buddy Holly was a great artist until the day he died.
