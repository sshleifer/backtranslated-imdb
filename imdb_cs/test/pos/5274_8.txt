That's stunning, Absurdist Short. Dressed in white, the miller approaches us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Even when the image is broken down, there is a clear logic. However, he is stopped sweeping, all in black because of his work. Will they start muttering without any special reason - did the snooty miller broom? Is this class a war? Whatever it is, his adversary takes the grain bags that fly all over the battle, making it redundant everything he did before the fight. . The Miller Grain Bleaches with Black Garbage - Later the Westerns would not be so gentle, heroes and villains are color coded. Is there a racial shade? If it weren't so great, the fighters are driven from the screen by a crowd of people who came out of nowhere, suitably Kafkaesque ending in a strange story (or are they just a social conscience that grows up against a fight that negates order and purpose?), and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema. This blend of comedy, surrealism and Absurd is an obvious predecessor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the greatest thrillers, Hitchcock's "foreign correspondent".
