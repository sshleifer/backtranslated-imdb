Ramin Bahrani prepares the scene early in the Chop Shop, which immediately recognized me from where the character Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend came from. They both get on the subway, and as soon as the door closes, they ask if they can have everyone's attention for a moment and sell sugar bars or M&M, or something like that, and then continue selling bars. If you (like me) are sometimes on the subway in New York at any time, it's a situation that happens so often that you hardly notice it. People on the subway often see children like these or minorities who sell or announce something and talk about something on the subway and pay no mind to them. Bahrani's focus is not necessarily just on the kids who ride bikes on stage, but on survival and the state of being when they are in a lower class in America. That is, then in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once. <br /> <br /> To compare it with a Pixote or a bicycle thief, it's not too far from leaping (actually at least the other father and son have each other), although Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style . We care about this character Ali, not older than eleven, and we work in a garage that cleans some cars and helps break down the others, and his sister who comes from the city to stay with him. But it's not just because we're forced to feed any clich√©s except, you know, brother and sister (more - so brother) trying to care for themselves. Bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspirations Ali has, the kind of goal that can be achieved in his situation: save enough to buy a used food cart that Ali and Isamar can operate on their own. It's All That Ali Works in, But What Bahrani Shows Us in Brutal Detail is This Work That Ali Must Do To Make It Though Its Disgusting Things Like tearing cartridges from cars at Shea Stadium or stealing a purse in a desperate moment. This makes it a more serious problem when But seeing what his sister is doing for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He didn't mention it and put it aside, but always something that adds tension, something he wants But to protect his sister. It adds to the tragedy when it finds out the real cost of what it takes to make a food wagon a profit maker, which will further contribute to the anxiety it just internalizes. One could immediately see that But is an orphan in a neighborhood like the one in Queens where the film was filmed naturally, as well as working with neo neo realism (it says realism). practically all non-professional actors in parts of mechanics and workers and people on the streets - but Bahrani is more focused on here and now, and that is what makes Chop Shop so immediate and cordial. There is no melodrama in the film, barely even a musical accompaniment, except live Latino music from cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on the very gentle moment that makes it pronounced in other scenes, such as the way it is, but behaves like sleeping the first night after witnessing Isamar's late night attempt, and we see how slips into bed. he knows he's awake, but he can't say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem smooth, like when a man shows But how feeding pigeons works. It's rough and rough as you can expect, and it's not giving much hope for your main characters, though a few moments of luck. It is also a great hand-made film, where the technique, as well as many films made in its urban tone and approach, informs and compliments the screen and what they do, but it is never sloppy or too flashy. The creator has a great 'real life' cast (But he was torn from a NYC public school without experience) and knows how not to lose shot while at the same time achieving brutal art with just showing what he shows. It is not the city of God or Pixote; it is his own little masterpiece about a character or character that we would usually not give a second look (or the first barely) on our journey in a city like New York. If you are not moving But and his daily struggle, I do not know what to do for you.
