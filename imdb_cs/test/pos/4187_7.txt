Sadly, this movie is "curio", which seems to be. Many people I asked, "Did you know that the Monkees made the movie?" usually answer "No". This means that if you are one of those big numbers, I suggest you see it, but with the following objection: If you expect a Monkey-style humor, it's there. It's just not all over the place like TV shows. Yes, they are trying to break their TV forms a little by poking fun at it, like a bunch of no-longer teenagers who were short of many sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be drunk to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you don't have to be drunk to understand. <br /> <br /> If you like classics, you'll love the spaced clips around the world. <br /> <br /> If you like the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the portraits. br /> <br /> If you are a Monkees fan, you can recognize some of the strikes they take on the heavy commercialization of the band. In almost immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes: "That's a weird movie, man." In fact, it can be better if you don't try to understand it, just sit back and react to it. It's weird, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still) ... it's a lot of things. Overall, it's an experience.
