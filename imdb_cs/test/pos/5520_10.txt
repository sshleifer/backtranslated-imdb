Look, it's a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems with low budget movies. But you only have to see it to see Lisa Erickson like Julie. It's SMOKIN 'hot and big little actress on boot! These types of horror movies often discover a precious gem and give us Lisa Erickson the power! Nothing I like more than sitting in my studio with Coke and putting on the movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree .. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a cat. The film itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, things start to jump. Others aren't clearly in her league. It's not an Exorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one you see!
