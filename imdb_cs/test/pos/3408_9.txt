I am a history teacher and overall I was satisfied with the film. My teenagers enjoyed it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little happy in places? Yes, but my kids took it from the computer and played for four nights watching it all. The battle scenes were impressive and we met a lot of historical characters. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stands out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff was Bent evil and charming. We all thought Charles had stolen the shows from Orry and George. <br /> <br /> We'll enjoy the movie again!
