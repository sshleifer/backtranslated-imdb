Soon Coppola with a noble cast that most people have never seen (shame). There are some amazing things going on in this thing - the best performance of Shirley Knight (underrated actress), a trip in the late sixties, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in the part he was born to play ), and a moving scenario with F. Coppola behind the wheel. <br /> <br /> If someone had done it five years later, no one would have, it would have been timing. Anyway, I recommend it to all people who don't need space explosions and bad mother's jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit back and watch the story unfold. Give this a chance if you find it!
