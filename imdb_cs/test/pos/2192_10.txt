When I didn't see the 1936 version of this story, I can't offer any comparison. However, I can say that the musical processing of this story by Stephen Sondheim is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right, but perfectly suited for a very bizarre theme. If someone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see it (and also "Dr. Strangel"). When Mrs. Lovett goes from the "worst cake in London" to a flourishing business with high regards, we don't talk "Soylent Green," - but the ingredients are similar. Especially brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett writes her idea for Mr. Todd. Even in the opening number, the line "... they went to their Creator impeccably shaved ..." a great hint of premise, drama and comedy. Excellent!
