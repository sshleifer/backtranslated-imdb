I'm a Maharashtrian, a teenager in the 21st century, and it's obvious I'm not much in Bollywood, let alone Marathi's movies. But when I watched Shawas, he left me a unique feeling that can only make a very effective film. It's the fact that the film, like most Indian movies, only has its true and complete effect when viewed in its original language. Lots of emotions and sense of film are embedded in its Marathi dialogue, which, however hard it attempts, cannot be effectively translated into English. Shwaas explores, in complex details, the relationship between a grandparent and a child. And to this strong bond is absolute justice. Dialogues such as "mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe" (My parsha is also one in a million) increase emotions. Anyone who has closely followed a grandparent-child relationship will be able to relate to the situation depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching. It is a film that has left a profound influence on me. I will definitely recommend it to everyone!
