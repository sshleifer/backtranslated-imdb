I was one of the lucky people who were invited to watch this movie in New York. It's a convincing story about how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the September 11 tragedy. This film made me laugh and weep and showed me how a human spirit can endure and love one of our darkest days through love and friendship. The filmmakers really captured the emotions of the people involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of many people. I went out of the theater that day and wanted to call all my friends to say hello. I recommend everyone to see this document. I would rate this movie with A ++++++++++. See if you have a chance.
