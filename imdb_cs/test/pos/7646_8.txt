I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company sounded interesting, so I watched it twice, and probably again. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to track the start, but it'll be clear later. I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying the free ends. Some of the actors are unconvincing, but maybe because I've always expected a double cross. In such a case, it would be a bad deal for the insincerity of the characters who cooperate with each other, so it fits very well. An important theme is the carnival owner (Assante), who wants to steal money laundering for a local casino and his wife with a snake charmer (Dagmara Dominczyk). She complains "Archie" (Reedus) how horrible her life is and how she would help her get out of her. There are 3 or 4 twist plots (which is probably the reason for all these free ends), and only when you think you've solved the mystery will something else happen. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mostly for conspiracy. I won no longer say - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this movie is worth your time.
