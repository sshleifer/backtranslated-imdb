It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a blow in the career of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNir. It's a fun movie and guilt pleasure, but not entirely in line with actors' standards, especially not Robert. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features several small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet way, while the other is easier and wants to have more fun than the back seat criminals. They are both the same criminals behind a huge TV set, video recorders, etc. Then the roads go over and the TV station wants a new TV show of reality to fight crime when they are on TV. Mitch hates publicity, while Trey loves him with his line, "It's Showtime!" Their television antiquity and methods are shown on television and are a new show "Cops". Entertainment begins. Overall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good movie, but not entirely in line with the actors' expectations and standards. However, it rolls together, as it treads and parodies reality television shows. Good break from the show like Cops. Really at the end, just guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
