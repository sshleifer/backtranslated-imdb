While you are a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic file, you will be hit by this exceptional help in science fiction territory. For once, there is no one deviously dressed vampire girl in sight! According to tradition, the budget has proved too tight to fully realize the director's vision. However, this is largely offset by his apparent love for genre film, his dedication to his craft, and his sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes most of the forefront, and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / and "Gary Sandeur") contributes a surprising soundtrack that is unlike any of the clever things he has done for hardcore. Friendliness and the neighborhood of the office block in Paris before and after business hours, the film was largely occupied by regular porn stars Rollin was already quite familiar with his "Michel Gentil" cash-gathering XXX efforts, especially the French f * ck movie royalty free stock picture by Brigitte Lahaie. She plays Elisabeth (quite well, I can add), she picked up a wandering on a nearby highway once by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long working day. Elisabeth, barely able to combine a series of events that got her there, seems to have lost her memories of moments after the events, even forgetting Robert's name and heroic rescue role before ending the night's flight in his apartment. Before she loves herself, she rightly describes herself as a virgin (another recognition of Brigitte's skills that she can handle the line so convincingly that she is one of the more active adult actresses of the 1970s) because she can't remember the one touch preceding him. Given this clever context, the relatively long sex scene that follows is totally avoiding the ingratitude of other "commercial" interludes Rollin had to include in further work to secure funding. When Robert Goes to Work He is inevitably erased from Elisabeth's weak mind. The mysterious physician (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively threw off the type) and his terrible assistant Solange (striking porn star Rachel Mhas) moved to her during the absence of her protector and took her back to the escape site. Here we get one of the most powerful scenes of the film when it re-introduces its roommate Catherine (late Cathérine Greiner and / k / hardcore performer Cathy Stewart) in a quiet devastating turn, both girls desperately delivering fictitious shared "memories" to themselves in an effort to overtake their inevitable fate. This deterioration is not limited to the mind that becomes painfully clear when lunch is served, and Catherine is unable to control her movements in an attempt to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who gets to the compromise of the creator with the demands of the trade when she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they left now when the mind and physical abilities left them. Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes are made in the mid-section movie and French porn aficionados should recognize such as Alain Plumey (and / and / and Cyril Val), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a wink and miss bit from future princess porn Marilyn Jess, whose rape in her hand, mouth and member of Plumey was present only in the film's rarely screened XXX version of FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique, a girl Elisabeth almost remembers and tries to escape again, is beautifully dominated by the excellent Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - which will play a significant role in LA Franco Zeffirelli. TRAVIATA. Six feet below the end reveals a deteriorating state that is the result of nuclear leakage, quarantine patients in the quarantine who eventually left a barely breathing empty shell that was ruthlessly removed in a fiery furnace. The last film offers an extraordinarily varied variation of what Chaplin's MODERN TIMES like Elisabeth, who is now approaching complete collapse, and the wounded Robert stumbles along the railway bridge, clumsily clutching his outstretched arms.
