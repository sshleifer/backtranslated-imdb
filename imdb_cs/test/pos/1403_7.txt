I just watched this short short film by Harold Lloyd, who featured his "glasses" on the DVD Movie "The Harold Lloyd Collection". It's actually a grasshopper with Snub Pollard as his partner, who was discovered by Bebe Daniels, who himself performs fake sessions. What he finds is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are "lost". I will stop there and say that it was pretty funny, especially when Harold and Snub entered the place where Bebe worked and encountered some ghostly hoaxes and dress up costumes like Snub, who is trying to get one of Bebe's outfits. Not too many grotesques, but what's there was also pretty funny. So on this note, I recommend Are Crooks Dishonest?
