This is the second film of 1985, the second was 'The Wedding Singer'. While 'Wedding Singer' featured a pop page of the '80s,' Rock Star 'is about metal. and Jennifer Aniston plays her girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes into one day. The story is not very dramatic and just scratches the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this film, but it's full of Rock'n Roll! Music is fantastic and concerts are brilliantly controlled! The whole concert feeling is very well captured because they used a real audience (no cgi here). Great Direction and Marky Mark's Great Performance, a Real Metal Dude! 'Rock Star' is about fun and if you had something to do with the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
