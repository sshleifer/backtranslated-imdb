Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just completed a solemn announcement of their engagement in France with family and friends when he received a letter asking to visit an ancestral castle located in Scotland. Gerald's uncle was reportedly ill and asked Gerald, the only heir, to be present. Gerald leaves for Scotland and leaves his future bride. A few weeks will pass and he won't come back. Concerned, Kitty broadcasts telegrams but can't hear back from her fianc√©. Four more weeks pass and Kitty finally gets a strange response from Gerald, invoking engagement and telling her to continue her life. He's not ready to give up his relationship and seek answers, Kitty hops on the plane, and decides to pay a visit to Gerald. Aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her lead role in the classic ISLE OF DEAD cooler) is on hand. When Kitty and Edith come to MacTeam, they immediately believe that something is strange. For the start of Gerald, he seems to be in a couple of weeks in twenty years. Secondly, this once handsome and charming man has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands to leave the castle and never return. When Edith comes with a mild cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things. Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to a woman he just gets married? Why is Gerald Unlike Company? Why do house rules state that guests must be kept in bedrooms at night? Why is it forbidden for guests to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and the big maze hedge? And what makes these strange stretching sounds every night? These are just some of the questions that MAZE presents. The film actually does a great job of building secrets and intrigues. You are really interested in what is happening and wait patiently for the resolution to explain the special events that are taking place. And then it happens ... I'm sure I don't want to destroy the final of this movie because you don't know, but it takes one of the most incredible and strange turns I've ever seen in every movie. It's a wonderfully ridiculous way, but it also takes a pretty solid little b / w secret and sends it straight to the Z-Grade schlock territory. And yet it seems that this end is not so good that you will not forget it once you see it. Despite the end (or maybe partly because of the end), I really enjoyed a strange bird. It is an extremely blunt and slow movement throughout the run, but I managed to keep my interest all the time. Director William Cameron Menzies (who produced the much more famous INVADERS FROM MARS in the same year) is best known as the two-time Oscar-winning artistic director and his scenography is also interesting here. Sometimes he feels almost silent film with model work for some of the exteriors, some painted backdrops and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle set, there are secret passages and long staircases. He also throws several rubber bats-on-strings for good measure. A few actors are a little stiff and embarrassing, but I liked most of the cast. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who, unfortunately, never seemed to be caught, even though they are beautiful and talented. Emery, who also gets into the narrator's play at the beginning and end of the movie, is decent enough to be a well-behaved and careful aunt. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate as a sinister servant of silvery hair, who walks this cheerfully upright zombie every time he goes up the stairs. Also on board in smaller roles are Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in Sherlock Holmes' WOMEN'S GREEN) and Lilian Bond (The Whale is the Old Dark House). Of course, Carlson also played in IT CAME OF OUT SPACE, CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON and some other horrible swings, so you got a pretty decent cast for genre fans. I say, look at it!
