Lady and Tramp II: Scamp Adventure I think it's a good movie, but I think the first lady and tramp movie is better because it's original and I would think that the original movies compared to the sequences is better. Lady and Tramp II takes off after the original, but this time it's a junior turn, Lady and Tramp's youngster (scamp) always hates being treated with things that must be done with him, according to the rules of the house, taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy, scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left loose. Scamp meets another dog called Angel, they both get along well and do the things that scampa's mother and father did, with Italian food (Spagetthi and Meatballs, etc.) After Scamp discovers he's loved by his family, especially his friend who is a baby, scamp returns and Angel joins the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
