Years ago, with "Ray of Light", Madonna broke into a truly amazing level of musical art, and from time to time has even exceeded its own standards. This concert production, with its hypnotic editing, amazing dance, hallucinatory light effects and trance-inducing measures, blows away all previous efforts. The apparent ambition of the Madonna - to unilaterally bring world peace through music and dance - may seem hubristic or absurd to some. But to hell, someone has to do it! With its remarkable talent for all those involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live from London" ranks it among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium.
