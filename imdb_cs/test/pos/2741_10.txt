If there's one cartoon that helped put UPA on the map more than any other, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This story of a little boy who only speaks sound effects has retained his charm for the past 57 years. In addition to the effects he loved music, abstract animation and background, Marvin Miller's story, almost everything. And he won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film from 1950. I'm glad I saw him on YouTube after reading this dr. Seuss for many years. Also, the creator of Rocky and Bullwinkle Bill Scott also contributed how awesome! I hope the following shorts will appear in the series, if not on YouTube, then maybe in the DVD collection. Now I think I'll see another short UPA ...
