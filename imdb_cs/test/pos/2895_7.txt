Long concert delays, Rush-in-Rio DVD is both convincing and unsatisfactory. This sleek two-disc set shows Rush at its best. After 30 years of perfecting their unique sound, it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever. The concert includes more than twenty songs, a documentary and three songs that have more viewing. Packed in a double-folded sleeve with a sleeve and a small insert, this is a very well-prized amount of material it contains. I'm a Rush fan at the end of the seventies and early eighties and this DVD comes through a big, half-show highlighting song of that time. I won't be a playlist if you want to be surprised. If you participated in the Vapor Trails tour then you will know what they will play. Play in Rio to your biggest crowd, Rush is a huge crowd pleasing here. In fact, it was one of the first things I noticed that it was special at this show. For most of this two-hour concert you hear and see the crowd, you are singing and dancing wildly to the music. At first it is encouraging to see Rush fans well deserved answers. But after a few songs I was ready to hear and see more band and less crowd. This is by no means a slam of the Rio crowd. More power to them! It's a critique of the final DVD editing. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason "I hate it". Video editing is, in my opinion, horrible. Aside from the bonus cuts with multiple points of view, the whole show is the madness of visual chaos. It is as if the director wanted to find out how spastic can do it. I count the changing camera angles on average between every and four seconds, constantly! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is too bad, because I would like to sit the whole show, as I was able to do at a concert last year. Maybe this quick cut is the last fad for a concert DVD, but I really think it's angry and detached from the overall experience. As already mentioned, I wouldn't mind for a song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is rushed, or RUSHED. It's really ironic because all the previous concert clips I've seen in Rush, mainly from Moving Pictures, are strictly filmed, with little toggle back and forth. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD came to the other extreme. I know a lot of colored Rush fans from the wave will vehemently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression of it. Bottom Line: If you're a Rush fan, I'll buy this DVD regardless of my rating or other. After reading my review I would still buy it. Don't just expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things listed above may not bother you.
