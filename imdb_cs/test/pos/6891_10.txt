Although it was off the air for 6 years, Promised Land was one of those shows that come together once or twice in a generation. Good cast, side cast (among them Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The story is believable when McRaney wraps his family and just says "to hell with everything" after he has been exposed to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from Vietnamese years. I think many Vietnamese veterans, including me, could actually relate to McRaney's thought process and ultimately decide on his progression. Many of us have done exactly the same in real life, after returning from this war and finding that America is not the same place we left. The show not only adds value, but also looks at what happened in one veteran's life. Only in these two ways, I think it is one of the most vivid TV series of our time. Why this program only lasted 3 years is over.
