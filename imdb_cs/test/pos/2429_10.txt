It was probably watching this TV movie that interested me about the debate about whether "Anna" was really the daughter of Tsarist Nicholas Anastasia. Since I saw it, I've decided to watch various documents and also buy a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, I sometimes think it is. This is the power of acting Amy Irving in this 2-parter, which is somewhat liberal with historical facts, but wrapped to the brim with a rough drama and Irving's absolutely convincing performance. I wasn't consciously aware of that Irving before, even though I had to see her without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia" I never felt it was just a movie. For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when one part ended up with her in a railway car where members of the royal family met, I knew there would be hell or high water that I had to see in the second part. I just wanted to find out how she could prove that she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed, I felt intense hatred for Rex Harrison, even though I admire him very much as an actor. When I saw a movie that was once again featured in a TV guide, I convinced my mother to watch her, and then thanked me for being almost as excited as I was watching to part 2. Then I bought the video and can recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies that you just have to watch for the ultimate enjoyment of watching the best I've ever seen on television, and it doesn't matter if you believe the legend or not.
