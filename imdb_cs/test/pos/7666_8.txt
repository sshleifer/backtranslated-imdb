This show was incredible, but it was too esoteric for most people. If you have never seen a European variety show in the 1970s or 1980s (or at least Mexican ones), the show would probably be lost. If you had, this show was dead on skewers of satire false spectacles and the shallowness that these shows plunge into their worst. "Viva Variety" is a variety that attempts to get out of the country for every episode, but always descends into the fighting. and actions that were very bad. The hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans", a muffled side kick that seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means that kids will love that, of course, they do not have the result was a cheerful spoof variety shows in general. Imagine arguing that has probably become a BACKSTAGE in the last days of "Sonny & Cher Show". Imagine this is happening ONSTAGE in front of you and the stars are trying to keep calm. Now add the cheesy acts and the euro-wealth mentality (tuxedos, dresses, booze, accents and smokes). Now you have "Viva Variety". Have you ever heard a musician whose music was largely written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did it for the comedians. WAY too esoteric for a standard American audience. It was funny like hell. And doomed.
