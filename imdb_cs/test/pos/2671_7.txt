Sometimes it is difficult to follow such a self-discovered "message" from an earlier, seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that has come to us from an early age, and as we have arrived, teachers and authorities have found it to be an increasingly inefficient but equally effective means of getting a message across. "The House I Live in (1945)" is about being intact as a "message," and does it seem that Frank Sinatra treats his audience as a child? It was probably the right point, because the short was undoubtedly intended primarily to influence younger filmmakers. Yet I found myself curiously hit when Sinatra launched into this sincere patriotic talk about what it really meant to be an American? and I'm not an American either! Just two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy welcomed war listeners with a message of tolerance, belonging and, above all, hope. Music is not bad, either. <br /> <br /> Freshly built Frank Sinatra ?? already a star, but not yet a superstar he would ?? opens the film in a recording studio where "If You Are But a Dream" develops with full orchestral accompaniment. When, among the songs, Frank goes out for smoke, he regards a large group of children bullying a young Jewish boy, their taunts provoked purely by his various religions. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly stops this childish behavior, gently branding bullying "Nazis werewolves" and expelling their irrational prejudices. Then sincerely and decently, he gives the group a clear stupidity of racial and religious discrimination and assures them that every American culture, different from our own, is still American in heart? if, of course, you're not one of those bloody "Japanese". There is a hint of hypocrisy in the plea for racial tolerance, and at the same time it represents one nation as a collective enemy, although you could hardly blame Hollywood for being less than excited about the Japanese situation in 1945. Sinatra manages His point home with a wonderfully pleasing rendition of "The House I Live In", which was written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the composer first heard the song in the film, he was outraged that the filmmakers completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered crucial for the message. These omissions were most likely due to time constraints, but of course Meeropol did not accept them too kindly and reportedly had to be fired from the cinema. When it was first released, 'House I Live In' was considered such an important short film that it won the Golden Globe for "Best Film for Promoting International Good Will" and an Honorable Oscar for All Participants. In 2007, it was considered "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and was added to the National Library of Congress's National Film Registry, which is the way I heard about it. While his approach may seem a little hockey sixty years later, this film is still very attentive thanks to a young Fell named Frank Sinatra.
