With all the em up, blood horror movies that came our way at the last minute, while "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, Hills Have Eyes" Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Why? Because it is a remake of the 1979 classic that was excellent at the time and scared what you know of everyone! I didn't know what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised! It was a movie of mood, atmosphere, tension! Because you remember people you don't see, what you think you see, what you can't hear, or what you think you hear is more frightening than what you do! If you like movies with mood, ghost, tension and atmosphere! You'll love it! It brought back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs Up, Hard 8.5 of 10 Remember People It's Good! imperfect! It's scary, not bloody, it's scary, not bloody! It was nice to see the movie this long. Our mind is conditioned and twisted by glitz and the shock of modern day horror movies, forgetting what's really scary.
