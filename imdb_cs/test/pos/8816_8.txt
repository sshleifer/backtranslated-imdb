Feisty Dianna Jackson (winning spunky performance of the gorgeous former "Playboy" Playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to make a bad ring of heroin that murdered his brother. Dianna is helped by friendly karate champion Joe (friendly Chiquito), facing opposition from secret agent Agent Elaine (beautiful, buxom blonde baby kitten Pat Anderson), and cock novels, mercilessly ambitious Charlie (essayed with superior arrogant aplomb Stan Shaw) while plotting her revenge against the criminal drug king Sid (efficiently slimy Ken Metcalfe). Director Cirio H. Santiago, working from a blithy cruel script co-authored by none other than Dick Miller (!), Crams lively and busy 72 minutes of running time with plenty of gratuitous distaff nudity and lots of poorly staged martial arts combat scenes (Bell is clearly doubled by squat who wears a giant Afro wig!). A definite sleazy highlight occurs when topless Bell singlehandedly beats a pile of robbers in her hotel room. Raw, grainy, scratched cinematography Felipe Sacdalana, clumsy use of strenuous slow motion, funky-groovin 'score, ridiculously awkward fighting choreography and a surprisingly horrifying conclusion add immensely to the overall scuzzy fun of this deliciously cheesy grindhouse exploitation hoot.
