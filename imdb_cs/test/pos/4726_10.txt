This is one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. If you allow yourself to identify yourself with Patricia Arquette, you will find it a very moving story of a woman who has regained her life and found a new will to live. His performance is brave because it is intentionally "wooden" - it's a way to define the spiritual death of her character, her total lack of desire to be alive. She goes through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and can't see life. The point is how the Burmese landscape re-awakens through the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and is forced to face the initial election. Boorman visually supports it (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most beautiful, haunted scores) with a often static camera and a tendency to shoot with glass, windows, windscreens, etc. like Arquette .... deep in the jungle and is forced to decide whether to fight for her life. I also recommend the 1954 film THE PURPLE PLAIN. It's a similar story in a similar setting and makes it a fascinating comparison.
