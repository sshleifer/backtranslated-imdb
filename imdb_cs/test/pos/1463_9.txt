After the heights of darkness, it was never possible that Holness and Adobye were able to create anything half as garth marengi. Still, I think a person to a person in his own right is just as good a show (for good episodes) as a dark place. I cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are'nt that good, but others 4 definitely come up for it. if i had to choose 2 big episodes id go for Formula 4 Drivers Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and Big Garth Marengi. They already have a bit of understanding the program is a real plus as Dean Learner does a lot of internal jokes, but even though you have seen many Dean id recommend, because some of the praise they put into are brilliant ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in All a great show that just lacks full marks because of a few less fun episodes.
