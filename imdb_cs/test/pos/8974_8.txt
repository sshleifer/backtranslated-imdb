I like to see an adult comedy. Masterfully structured Aaron Sorkin through Mike Nichols own championship. Mr. Nichol's championship is to represent characters in all their shocking truths, from the sad and rousing Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and ravishing Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in "Closer. The "Charlie Wilson War" is a shocking truth outside the characters and the sad and ravishing Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are on duty to something else, it's just personal. Hanks is to bury his brilliance in single malts, and Julia Roberts throws parties and introduces characters with obvious straightness. Amy Adams testifies and exists as a character, testimony. An unbeatable task that Miss Adams can beat beautifully. It's Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus, saying it has affected me. His character doesn't have to be the first, but it's the first way Hoffman introduced us. Someone who survives the contempt with which he is absolutely convinced that he is smarter than all together. Hoffman is excellent. Stimulating the story helps not to fall into countless unnecessary questions. Sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when did I last say it?
