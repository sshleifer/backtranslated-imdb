A pretty good movie about a man and his wife who are trapped in a murder and a police officer is investigating the case. It starts amazingly, but at some point it hits the wall. We are sure that we know what happened, then the little conspiracy that initially appears to be a red herring that emerges and disappoints. Yet Clouzot's direction is great, and acting is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also starred in Drôle de Drame Marcel Carné, gives the best performance as a clever detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo. Like this movie, a policeman does not appear almost in the middle, and then becomes almost the focus of the film. There is also a lot of comedy that surrounds him (though sometimes his methods seem like a fascist).
