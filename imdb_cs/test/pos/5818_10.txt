Life is insane. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're crazy. We're all a little Minnie and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems to be best to be reasonable ... but then what could you miss? You must be you. You don't have to park your cars and shout at people half-smiled, but you can't hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything's fine. And sometimes you really have to watch the wind, because why else are you alive? I will not evaluate this love compared to the other Cassavetes films because they are all 100% unique to work and each their own expression of expression and exploration of our lives. In this sense, they are all great and comparisons are disgusting. Surely this movie has the crazy, sometimes crazy but ultimately amazing and relaxing quality that all of its films have - you never know what will happen next, and you never know what characters will think, do or feel. Not even the characters themselves - and do we really want to live our lives differently? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and deliberately postpone money to your IRA, but you still live the life of an adventurer - in your feelings, in your spirit and in your life experience. Yeah, we can have it in both ways, Cassavetes shows us. Thank God someone did it.
