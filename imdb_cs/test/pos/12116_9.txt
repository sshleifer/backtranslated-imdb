That was a great anime. True, the animation is old but still worth watching and has a better plot than the Ninja Scroll, the problem that it was a bit long. Japanese film star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio from the last Samurai, starred in the lead character Jiro and directed Rintaro, who made Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. Anime has some good animation for old anime, interesting characters like the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan, and of course don't forget the beautiful musical scores in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching anime fans, animations in general, action, and Samurai / Ninja flicks is worth watching in all these movies. Despite the lows in the movie, which didn't look like a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
