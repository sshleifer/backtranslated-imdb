A journalist who writes about living on his farm when he actually lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when he learns that her publisher and war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, thanks to the subtle cast, it turns into a fun comic cartoon. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck displays a nice comedy atmosphere. Morgan is smooth as a welcoming war hero, while Greenstreet is well cast as a publisher. However, Sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
