That was an interesting movie ... half-comedy, a half-political thriller. She had a lot of good elements, though it was a bit predictable. Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives a political commentary. Think a daily show with John Stuart. While recording one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him he should run for president. The one that was followed by several jokes that were taken seriously was all that was needed to get the ball going and starting Dobbs' political career. It runs independently and is against Democrats and Republicans alike. It is straightforward and honest and is becoming increasingly popular - but perhaps not popular enough to truly win. There is clearly a loser in these elections. Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program to make voting much faster and easier for ordinary people - but there is a glitch. This glitch is discovered by a young lady named Elanor (Linnley), who is reassured by a software developer with lies that corrected the fault before the upcoming election. The election day is coming, and behold, Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big Surprise!) Elanor knows he's not the president - he didn't legitimately win - decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. Her company went to poison her to silence her. Besides, he quickly takes Dobbs. The storyline has a few twists and turns before it reaches a slightly predictable conclusion. But it was never boring. Robin was great as usual and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs' manager - Reversed - political advisor and best friend. It's a fun movie and has good news. I recommend it if you are in the mood for a dark satire or something you think of. Overall, I give him 7/10.
