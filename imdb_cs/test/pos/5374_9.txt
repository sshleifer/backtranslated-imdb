The 1970s was a great time for horror movies. The Satanic Brotherhood is another overlooked jewel. It is full to the brim with great surrealistic, disturbing scenes. It's also great to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (which he also produced) in decent roles. Some of them are a little dated and curvy, but the Brotherhood of Satan kicks ass through Race Devil and many others' Satanism of the 70s.
