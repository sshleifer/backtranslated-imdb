I am a great Italian fan and I like films by directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr just to quote the most famous ones. "La villa delle anime maledette" is one of the most famous films of this genre, filmed when this kind of cinema began its crisis, which continues today, and director Carlo Ausino sounded completely new in my ears. that is the price that Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome ...). But the movie is not that bad. And it's not exactly right to talk about "garbage". OK, the storyline is not so original; It reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as "Amityville Possession" by Damian Damiani) or "Shock", the latest work of Mario Bava. But you have to think it is a cameraman movie (like Mario Bava's films); so the most important is the atmosphere, not the story or characters; atmosphere very well created by using light and camera movement. The rest will remain in the background. I think the movie works; not so good, but it works; it's definitely better than a lot of Hollywood production like "Haunting", which has a bigger budget but no bigger ideas ...
