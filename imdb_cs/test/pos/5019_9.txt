Why would this film be so good, but only a rough estimated $ 95,000,000 and have no prizes? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows Michael is a cigar smoking, a womanish, magical arch angel who came to live with a dying lady and is now in the car with the staff of "The National Mirror" and their dog, Sparky, on their way to Chicago. Then it turns into a trip that is terrible and great. I don't even think of a scene of death (3 to be exact) to tearjerker it. The soundtrack is best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around Bend" and "Chain of Fools". I have very great expectations about this and I say that in the 1990s she should have had a little more respect. Read my comment. Goodbye!
