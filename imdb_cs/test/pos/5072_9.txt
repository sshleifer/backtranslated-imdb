Some movies are designed to entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others like this, aim to provoke, think, and get angry. During this film, I was angry, not on film, but on the fact that it was true that America, single, tortured in an illogical view that it was doing for the greater good. The torturous scenes in this movie were appalling, people's indifference shook, the film was convincing in its argument, and showed how bad it was to torture people. Of course, I made it "bleeding liberal" labels that were thrown on people by others who close their minds to the facts that it was happening and shouldn't. People who do not realize that, as the film has said, for every person tortured, you will receive ten or a hundred people who will act as revenge. You are getting a growing cycle of violence. This movie didn't bore me America, even though I can see how it can do it, but it hates me in the way America reacted in the world after 9/11. There is a significant quote in the film, just after we learned that 19 people died and seventy-five people were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is "one American is dead" - that's the difference. You can't kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can't kill an American, or do everything in his power, including torture, to accept justice. This is probably the American way. Call me Liberal, call me naive (although I think people who think torture is okay are naive) tell me they deceived me, call me whatever you want, but this movie is a great example of what is bad in America and the West today. I wish that this film was at least shown to all school students. This movie will stay with me for a long time, part of me wishes to forget it because I wish this kind of thing never happened, but I know it does, the other part wishes me to never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from doing again. Whatever happens to me, this movie will be with me for a long time and I will tell everyone that I will watch it, not be entertained, but be provoked because sometimes we must all be provoked.
