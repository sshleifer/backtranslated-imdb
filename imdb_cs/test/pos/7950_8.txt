How would you feel if you only had a few weeks to live? This film will help you find out the eyes of one guy who is struggling with the situation. It's called compassion and without too much emotion. Some might consider it slow - but I think it contributes to the realism of the film. Some might see it as a love story, but I think it's secondary to seeing his last days through his eyes. The love of his life is part of the end of his life and gives him more influence. Low key and gentle, the film throws the story as well as life. Without clich√© and unexpected events that are built in the background to get there. If you like your movies gently emotionally realistic, it may be for you.
