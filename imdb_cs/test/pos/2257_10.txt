I thought this movie was amazing. I was a bit skeptical because I had no idea what it was, but it was a beautiful story. I was screaming very much and also laughed loudly. I think it is very important that films are made about the Holocaust and how it affects people (60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe and studied the Holocaust, so this movie meant a lot to me. I think this movie has done an amazing job of capturing this story (I'm used to going into detail, I don't want to spoil it) But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that I know may be clich√© 'but your thinking about things will change.
