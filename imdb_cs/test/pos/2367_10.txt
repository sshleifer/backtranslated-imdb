Many 'alternative' comedies in Britain in the 1980s were insular, misleading, too political and unfair, and the worst of the things that have become Comic Strip ... fall into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works at different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal or is he lying? He says the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, anti-double-temperament-bluffing anything? I probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. That's a wonderful thing. Like Ade Edmonson, there are big roles for other Comic Strip comics - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane. Curiously not Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> All Comic Strip casting - although I don't like the hidden agenda of some of their members - is a persuasive actor and becomes a great performer on this big-screen trip. while the work of the Richardson-Richens writing team is so often a pure genius, with fine detail details. Finally, it is a study of crime, criminology and human nature; And very funny. You won't be disappointed.
