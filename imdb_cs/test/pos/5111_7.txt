This was easily one of the stranger films of Ernest, especially with regard to production design. What was with the pink protective uniforms? Sadly, this movie apparently destroyed Ernest, turning the series into a video series. However, Jim Varney gave one of his better performances by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. Wrong step in the show, but in most cases it wasn't too bad (Electro Man routine was classic)
