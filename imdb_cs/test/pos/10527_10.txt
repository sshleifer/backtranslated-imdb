Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Surprising Attention to Authentic Details of the Period for this Time (Many films from the mid-1970s - early 1980s that try to make the 1920s - in the early 1930s seem to be my hobbies until the mid-1970s and early 80's. Costumes and sets are very well done. Did I like this production a lot? very much due to the adorable Francesca Annis portrayal of a carefree bright young lady "Frankie" and the charming Bobbie James Warwick. The couple would go on to portray Christie Tommy and Tuppence, which is funny as some contemporary critics of the book compared Frankie and Bobby to her earlier characters Tommy and Tuppence. Supporting characters were just as well done? Mrs. Rivington (Miss Marple-to-be-Joan H.) and "Badger" are played perfectly as a WWI post, "Bertie Wooster type."
