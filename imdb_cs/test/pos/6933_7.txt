I'm a joke for B-movies. I like old fare like this movie. It seems that this film, made for very little money, does one thing that some larger budget films fail. It's cheerful. It's bloody. He has no real plot, but I enjoyed it for an hour and a half. Either I laughed or covered my eyes in shock. There are several great effects like the shot from the mouth of a INSIDE guy as he stabs his chin with a knife and pokes his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one rude with the guy who is getting the eyeball flying out. But there's also a lot of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the demon possessed a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue the killers spewed when they tortured and killed people. He has great work with the camera and some great editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed zombie movies from the 1970s and 1980s and still has a cheering factor that is powerful. Don't expect Romero, just the second Fulci. I'd say Horror fans will like it, and that's a funny and fun and fast ride through the B-movie Land.
