What is music in the first transformation scene? I heard it was "The Greeks Don't Get Freeks". Is it right? I really liked the sound. I also like "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" in the final stages. Really doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, gagy look, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo resembled places I visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other things that are really amazing. She looks very different in the film we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her. Mark Blankfield reminds Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
