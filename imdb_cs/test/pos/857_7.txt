I caught this movie at the local t.l. I had no expectations at about 4:30, but after the opening credits, I knew I was good. It really happened, so your attention is a key factor. The whole psychological thriller situation deals with a lot of character development and the way things are done by the main character. <br /> <br /> Your sub - Trust also plays an important role because you will be able to interpret and create your opinion correctly through a series of events and dialogues. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is a candy to the eye, though she is most of the time in white outfits. The fear factor is almost non-existent, but there's a lot of secrets and strains to kick from. I would recommend it to those who have supernatural and psychological thrillers.
