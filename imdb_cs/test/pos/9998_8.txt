This film impressed me extraordinarily. It's one of the best sports movies I've seen. The visuals in this film are excellent. I love the sequences in which the camera follows the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well and offers both excitement and drama. The movie was fantastic. Performances are great. I was surprised by the young Shia LaBeouf. Stephen Dillane is also as good as the tense Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas offer support. The film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life made me watch a golf tournament.
