When I first heard that the Checking Out theme was a suicide side, my first thought was both morbid, tasteless and then comedy. I was skeptical. But I was dead wrong. I totally loved it. Casting, funny one liners and especially a surprising ending. Suicide is a delicate matter, but very well. Comic yes, but where it was needed. The review also deals with other common issues that I think many families can make friends with, with tact and humor. I highly recommend Check Out. YOU MUST SEE. I look forward to its publication.
