This movie was a surprise. The synopsis story sounds eccentric and stars Clint Eastwood and the Great Geraldine Page. I didn't know what to expect. There's the opening scene where a wounded soldier says the age of 12 is old enough to kiss and continue to give the child a persistent and very adult mouth. The child takes him to the boarding school where he lives. He uses the situation by trying to seduce the director, who is played by Party, her assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigues, and sages disappear in this beautifully original story. <br /> <br /> I read more comments here and disagree. However, I wanted to make it clear that there are no likeable characters in the film. I found out there was one. An attractive female slave successfully resists soldiers in a scene that works well because it touches on the common history of black men used by white men. Though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum of her experiences, what I regard as a likable character. More than any of the other women and girls at school has a legitimate reason to participate in what will eventually happen.
