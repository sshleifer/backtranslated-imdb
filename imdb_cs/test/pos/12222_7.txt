This DVD file is a complete widescreen 15-episode run of "Surface", a TV show produced by Universal in 2006. The full run time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus several bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special featurette effects). It was a fairly high budget show and much of the budget makes it onscreen in the form of quality design production and special effects. Unfortunately, 10+ hours is a lot of time and as usual with this type of stuff, overall quality begins to decline in later episodes. I found that the first 7 episodes (Discs 1 and 2) are very interesting and the rest is disappointing. "The Surface" was created, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seems that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to pave enough good sequel material as they rushed to fill the order for further episodes. It even looks like other writers were brought for for later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack cohesion with the way they were played in the early episodes. The series was canceled and although the last episode provides the conclusion of the species there is still many things left to hang. It's basically a sci-fi story about genetically engineered dragons; a kind of television mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as a puzzle as the crew-less navy sub is found bothered at sea, yachtsmen on Lake Texas are sucked into the whirlpool, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. Etc. this vague amount is a fair amount of voltage and voltage. The human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. Lake Daughterty is a Californian marine biologist who discovers a strange creature coming out of an underwater thermal hole on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) sinks with his younger brother in the bay when a similar creature pulls his brother away (he will never see again). Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager who discovers strange eggs in the ocean. He takes one home where it goes into the "ET" dragon. The rest of the series will try to hide their strange beast from their family and from local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they are indestructible electric eels, firing electromagnetic pulses, causing lightning strikes, emptying sea fish, and breeding like a bunch of Randy rabbits when they find the underwater heat flow of boiling water. It is interesting if it is uncertain whether or not they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless. Once you start to suspect their origin, it is all very tired and predictable. Jay R. Ferguson (a tremendously bad actor in the David Hasselhoff tradition) basically plays Richard Dreyfuss from the "Close Encounter of the Third Kind", so you know that with a better actor and better director it could have been an interesting character . With each episode you'll grow to hate this character. Unfortunately, what starts as three parallel storylines is soon condensed into two because Ferguson and Bell (a low budget version of Sandra Bullock) are soon paired and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as unlikely as the things "Jason Bourne" gets into. You expect plots and the need to suspend distrust in this type of show (which may be part of the fun), but their adventures are not just unlikely, they are totally and totally boring. There are three consecutive episodes that have Ferguson and Bell together in a submarine that will have a desire for the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast and segments of his home dragon (Nimrod) are often cut often with the boring material Ferguson-Bell to watch you. And these segments benefit from the presence of wonderful Leighton Meester (the recent "Gossip Girl" fame) as his sister Savannah. Producers seem to have taken this importance to their "teenage boy" target group, and one positive thing they did with later episodes of the series was to introduce Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as the "first love" interest for Miles. So, as Savannah's screen time decreases Catlin is gradually gradually in. <br /> <br /> In a retrospective they needed a third story to keep viewers biased and it would be better to limit adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
