Oz is no doubt my favorite show of all time! the best word we'll describe is "genius"! writing, playing, storyline .. all about this show is absolutely amazing! I just discovered the show and immediately became addicted to it and I was really surprised that he didn't get the recognition he really deserved. It's violent, and most characters aren't meant for you to enjoy it, but the show is written in a brilliant way that allows you to look around violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the smallest forms of scum, but they still find a way to allow you to understand many characters and even take care of their stories. Violence on the show is necessary to be as realistic as possible, but the show is not about violence, as some people might believe. It's really a work of art and I'm sure who will give him a chance to love him as much as I do.
