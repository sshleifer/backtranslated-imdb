Alfred Hitchcock's Remake "A man who knew too much" is usually not considered as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. I prefer "Vertigo" and "Rear Window." Like "North of the Northwest," it is the story of an average person who is inadvertently thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is wrong with an international spy. He will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family. <br /> <br /> While the original was good, it's time to follow, according to today's standards. The remake has an excellent production quality, a cute Doris Day, and a really scary villain. Don't bother to rent this one because you'll want to see it over and over again.
