It is a film that every child should see before it grows and distorts, often passing on from generation to generation. I grew up in two different places, though only 20 miles apart. I went to school and had friends of all colors and religions for the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to a hilly country (though not anymore), where it was very unusual to have even one African-American boy in your classroom. My high school graduate class had 2 or 3 African-Americans (God, why can't I just say black? Can you call me honky or whitey or whatever! happens when people get a distorted look or just what ignorance or lack of understanding of culture or country! It is an excellent film that everyone should see especially children.
