Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to fulfill the role of Philadelphia Gordon Cato, in this story, which is often compared to the classic American Civil War by Margaret Mitchell Gone With the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is probably his best role as her kind interest in love, and both leaders lead in this wonderful Australian cast, probably the most famous and popular Australian miniseries. It is an excellent production all the time, even if you do not try to watch all in one hit, and it deserves to be remembered as a wonderful display of life in pre-federation Australia. Rating: 8/10
