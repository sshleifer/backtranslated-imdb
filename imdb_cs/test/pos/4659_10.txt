I have no idea what the budget for this movie was, but whatever it was, they did it! I saw movies that spend 100x the amount (Pearl Harbor?) And sucked 200x worse. This movie has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton starring as Adam, an average college student who wraps up a game called Great AllNighter "Run Leon! This Rock Boy!" Genius "with nothing better than coming up with a sophisticated game for a lot of people to play but not just taking friends, it has a team of Jocks, nerds, fatties, average kids and of course Flounder's team that are" bad guys ". There is no black and white color, there are many shades of gray, Adam is not an altruistic hero without defects, he treats Alexa as crap and flounder is the way he is dirty because of the pressure of his father and the rough stomach, but everyone else! This film rocks! Scene at PBR Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better guide? This is Jerry's gold! GOLD! Maybe I'm from another generation, but I love movies that seem far more appealing, but they still have roots in reality, it never happened ... but it could have been. e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Show! Oh and watch young Paul Rubens still working on that Pee wee character. PS that Devra Clinger WAS / HOT! She had to be one bad actress who wasn't working in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS FILM!
