Brilliant movie! I'm sorry to remind me of something like Pulp F. but that's how it is with the pulp posture. Many images are compared to being just a gangster. But this is well written, funny coincidence, ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something of Tarantino, which is a good resemblance! The film is about a guy in Australia who is still mixing with a cruel criminal gang and ends up in debt and deep. To his help is his late brother (whoever remembers Val Kilmer in the right R?) To pay his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. Gangsters are cold-blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on raising their children! They also get served tea from their grandmother while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their children during a robbery. A funny gangster with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan) and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader.
