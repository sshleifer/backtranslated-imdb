Mars horses are an engaging animated short time that sometimes looks at the process of evolution through the eyes of those who are still evolving. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this sci-fi story. I was fortunate enough to see this short widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and I have to assume that when it is transferred to a small screen, it loses some of its ability to draw readers into an equally sophisticated story and stunning graphics.
