When I sat down in the cinema to see it, I expected to see a kind of stylish action film with a tongue in the face that was embodied by trailers. However, it quickly turned out that this film is trying to be more. Normally I disagree with films that try to entertain in many possible ways. For example, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, ease and bold esteem. Most of the time this kind of approach doesn't work in movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that in this case they downloaded it. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very entertaining movie that should reach most mature cinemas. (However, a weak stomach should really be warned against one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull out a brilliant double act and Ken Stott makes a great villain. This mixed with excellent costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very nice watch. However, for me this is a great reason why the 'The Gentleman Highwayman' has found a real opportunity for some good dialogue, but the script was definitely lacking in fright and there was little laughter in the belly. Okay, so the lines weren't terrible, but for me it points to a problem with recent British movies; ignoring several notable exceptions to the scenario being written today are still relatively moderate compared to some Hollywood efforts.
