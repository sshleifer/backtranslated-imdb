That's better than the first. The film opens with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Anne pack up and head for Tropican, while Jack tagged with them. stabbed with icicles, engraved eyes, head bursts, drowning, curtains, lobsters stuck in their faces, slit throats, freezing to death, killed snowballs, weapons ripped off, melted antifreeze, icicles on the neck, hit in the face of pots and pelvis away, icicles through the mouth, bites on the neck, exploding people, toasted snowballs and stuck in mixers. Snowballs are merry, put them in a blender and turn it on, then it says 'it was fun' they put in the waffle thing and gets burned. This is just a great movie. Then they start thinking about other ways to kill it, and the answers to the snowball, "it's not nice" <br /> <br /> It was the ten money you used to buy. 10 out of 10 stars.
