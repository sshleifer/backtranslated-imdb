Other well-executed moral ambiguities, where the anti-hero makes it difficult to decide who they are rooted in. If nothing else "The Beguiled" has silenced anyone who said there are no good parts for the actresses in the movies. at least in 1971. In this film, there were four outstanding pieces for actresses and all were well-filled and well done. Pamelyn Ferdin did a great job as Amy and started playing "Wanda June". It must have been the first time an adult male box office shared an extended kiss with a twelve-year-old girl on a camera, wondering if there was a lot of controversy at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Given the fate of Amy "Randolph", it's no surprise that Ferdin grew up on a tough animal rights activist. Geraldine Page was also excellent, playing a complex character with the right amount of limitations. Interestingly, she died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (she threw herself through the fifth-floor window) because they also worked together in "You're Big Boy Now". Hartman (who seems to be Blair Brown's sister) was as wonderful as Edwin and was supposed to have an Oscar (no other performance was that close in that year), but given what she is now about We know how much of her performance has been studied and how much has just come from within. Edwin shows such brutal pain that is hard to follow. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible performance in "The Misfits," the viewer is likely to see a lot of his own demons in the character he plays. Finally, there is Jo Ann Harris, who is amazingly perfect as a coquettish Carol. For my money, Harris was the 70's best actress, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. She was the best reason to watch the "Most Wanted" TV series and the only reason to watch "Wild Wild West Revisited". It's hard to believe that someone who could get it all on the screen never became a big star.
