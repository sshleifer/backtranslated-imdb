Dark Harbor is a whimsical little trip to the dark emotional waters that run very deep. It is basically a 3-character piece, featuring the finely-layered performance of the always-great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. Perfect late night cable film, with a surprising start to start.
