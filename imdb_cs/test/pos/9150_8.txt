Fran√ßois Villon was a real poet and vagrant who lived in Paris in the 15th century. Most of what is captured in this historical film is actually a fiction - a game created in the early 20th century. While in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, in fact he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues as he was in this film. In fact, he wrote several beautiful verses and often found himself on the wrong side of the law - not a combination of a patriot and a character similar to Robin Hood like the one in the film. If you know the movie is almost 100% fiction, then it's worth seeing - just don't assume it's a good lesson in history. Villon plays with the wild abandonment of John Barrymore in THE THE BELOVED ROGUE. I was also very excited to see his three friends playing very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was a rough dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was an actor known for adding a comedy movie. Mack Swain is best known in many short films as Chaplin's silent film and played his partner in GOLD RUSH. All four of these men did a good job and had no complaints - not even Barrymore's over-the-top treatment, which rather resembled Douglas Fairbanks' performance. However, the performance I had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this "rude" would be a gross understatement. He played a role as a high schoolboy who thought he was supposed to be a stereotypical Richard III - skulking about and acting as a demoniacal cartoon. While Veidt has been amazing in many, many movies (both silent and audio), but here's just ridiculous. As for the story, it's full of lusty adventure and action - like a thrilling film minus a sailboat. The sets did it all well, just like last year for THE THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both movies were set in the same time period. Overall, it's one of the last great movies. There is a lot to be enjoyed and the film is a beautiful combination of romance, comedy and action. It is worth seeing, even though it loses a few points for Veidt being excessive, as well as the way the film plays fast and freely with history. By the way, this movie was also made twice when I was KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two movies are closest to the original game. In total, however, there were six films about Villon that tell more or less about the same story!
