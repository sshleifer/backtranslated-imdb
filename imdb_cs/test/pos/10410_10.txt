www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series that should be captured on DVD. That was a show I rarely missed. I found a petition to return it to DVD. I remember one show where this overweight lady wore glasses that allowed her to talk to food. Needless to say, she couldn't eat her friends, so she starved to death. Another episode had an accounting visit to an underground drain and an underground security branch. The accountant wanted to stop funding the project. As it turned out, the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
