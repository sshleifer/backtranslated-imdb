Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine amazing writing, great production and emphasis on clever ideas over teen pap. These two stars work great and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. The launch of the film "Irkel" and Lee Majors were brilliant in the film. Watch this movie with your kids. You must not be careful if you do not laugh at it.
