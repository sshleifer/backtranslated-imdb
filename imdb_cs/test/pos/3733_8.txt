I'm a boy, so I was very hesitant to watch the movie because I know Richard Gear likes to play in jerk movies. I'd rather watch the action / adventure / sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a blockbuster. Diane has tended to behave as many times as richard. The daughter was a suppressed teenager with a huge attitude, so you started hating her. The film is too predictable, but for fun purposes it was a masterpiece. Go rent, see if your tear is fired. The beach scenes were perfectly shot. Although the hurricane scenes were a bit out of sequence, there was still a little panic to watch them react.
