Following the release of 'Snow White and Seven Dwarfs (1937),' Walt Disney Productions continued to produce quality animated feature children's film, many of which I still had no pleasure to see. 'AristoCats (1970),' directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth movie at Disney's official canon and is a romantic musical comedy that revolves around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910. In Madame Adelaide Bonfamille Baddeley), her loving cat pets? including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens? most important inhabitants. When the wandering servant Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) learns that cats have inherited the fortune of an old lady, he sets out to dispose of the pet and store it in the countryside far from the city. Lost and bewildered, Duchess and her children visit the cat talking to the sweet-talking alley by Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. Animation-wise, 'AristoCats' is nothing particularly remarkable, with much older Disney movies like 'Snow White'? and 'Fantasia (1940)', demonstrating a similar or even better visual style. But the story is interesting and exciting? especially for younger audiences, will I bet? and the music numbers (which I wanted to be more numerous) are amazing. Because of the little things I name my two favorite songs like "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat", the other being a psychedelic return to the late 60s, with a swinging jazz band and crazy flashing colors, led by fashion a cat called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family trip to Paris is rich and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two talking geese), Uncle Waldo (drunken couple drunk), Georges Hautecourt (Mrs. Bonfamille's ancient lawyer) and Napoleon. Lafayette (two stupid dogs with hunger for the butler's back).
