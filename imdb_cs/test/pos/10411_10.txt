One of the reasons they call the 1980s is "The Awesome 80's", which is a quality television. Exhibitions like Wonder Years, War of the Worlds, V, Amazing Stories and many others have always left the impression that everyone "happy", one of us, who always finds a way to wake up again. Upstairs, here comes Monsters! A series of totally unique and custom theme - monsters. It can be good, bad, and morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic shows, or if you are fascinated by horror movies, then it is absolutely for you. Assuming you can find this precious gem. Even newer generations will be in awe with some of the episodes with its grittiness, it's indiscriminate use of gore effects or its story to tell strength and simplicity. I guarantee because I'm 23 :). <br /> <br /> Don't forget to miss it! Although it is a show that the modern world has forgotten, it will always be with those who always remember ...
