Behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy getting off the train. He comes from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he hasn't seen in ten years. We meet a man at the station. He never smiles. So we start our journey to the Four Friends, a powerful and amazing film by Arthur Penn. You can ask why I started my review this way. Well, that's the way video box describes the movie. You may have discovered that the film will be the story of a boy trying to get along with this emotional person and eventually peel off his envelope and reveal a favor. <br /> <br /> I bought it, I have a bridge I want to sell to you. Modern Hollywood would do the movie. Penn was always an outsider and never resorted to a typical clich√© of narration. He always tells interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Chase", "Alice's Restaurant" and underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" is no exception. A typical Hollywood movie would focus on a boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script focuses only on it for about 4 minutes and then leaves it. We meet an adult Danil, played by Craig Wasson (whom you can recognize from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David, and a passionate Georgia. Film us all over the 1960s. Events in the smaller movie would now be paid attention. But in "Four Friends," these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more interested in character study than conspiracy, and I think the movie is better. We know events; we don't need to look at them again. I know I've described most of the plot, but I don't know if you can describe "four friends". It's not one of those "high-concept" movies that can be described in one sentence. It is a film of many moods and textures. It is also a truly emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this film has moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does the film have the strength to reduce me to tears. Acting is the first speed, especially Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the most underrated actors who work today. That's so difficult, an emotional performance, and Wasson pulls him away. He was supposed to receive an Oscar. Another great performance is Jodi Thelen, who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But he does it very well and gives Georgia some dignity that most Hollywood actresses would not want (they would be too frightened to try, they would be more interested in the image than in the big performance); She also earned an Oscar. The "Four Friends" didn't get any pressure in 1981. And the unsound managers couldn't push it like another "American Graffiti" (lacks the "Four Friends" argument). They let it die. Too bad because it's one of the best films of the 1980s, a decade when more and more neat baskets were created and great art like this was homeless. I ask you to give this movie a chance. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
