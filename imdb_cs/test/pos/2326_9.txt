"Down Periscope" has been in our library since VHS first arrived. Since then we have acquired DVD and Digital from Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> This is an unpredictable movie that doesn't come militarily overboard for professionals or con. It is mainly comedy and as a means for the main characters I am quite surprised that the sequel has never been offered. The film has earned the following boundaries of cult obsession, even among the young. During 2002, I learned about it when visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama. The Cub Scout group, my grandson among them, took over the roles of the film and planned to survive them again during their overload on board. It's a fun game that makes you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood ... which is a rare company. Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for what they might have been an extraordinary movie, such great fun!
