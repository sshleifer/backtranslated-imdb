I tried to remember the title of this movie for years and years. Finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, which mentioned Stacy Keach's name, and reminded me that I saw a film that was at the Atlanta Film Festival in 1974, so I searched Google's Keach movies. and found the Gravy Train. We should have seen Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they couldn't show it and instead replaced Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we were not able to see so much upset Duddy Kravitz and we didn't hear anything about The Gravy Train and they didn't hear anything about it. Nevertheless, I remember we were pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as I recall, it was pretty funny. I'd like to find him on tape.
