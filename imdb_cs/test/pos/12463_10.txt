There is no doubt that this version of Tarzan is closest to the vision of Burroughs. While he readily collected his royalties from films produced during his lifetime, he often made it clearly stated that they were a little more than the bastard children of his stories. Film studios "A ridiculous obsession with casting Olympic swimmers like Tarzan was out of laughter." I think we should consider it happy that they did not set their intentions on shot putts. <br /> <br /> Comics and comics were the most faithful to this film. As well as some of them, we had to wait seven decades for the filmmaker to respect the character he created.
