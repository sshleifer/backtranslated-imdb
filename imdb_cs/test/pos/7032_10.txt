Jennifer Gray gives an absolutely amazing and first-class performance in the role of Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and talent for dancing and is beautiful and charming on the dance floor. But what's amazing about Baby is that it has such amazing depth and dimension as its character. It's not just a dance movie, but the screenwriters have also given us a chance to see how the child is dealing with the different emotions and feelings she experiences throughout the film and allows us to see how her interaction with others changes on camp changes. her life.
