Extremely slim vision of a war situation where a few of the Vargtimmen (ok, have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) are caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The depiction of combat parties as anonymous, superior authorities is often captured in noble surrealistic images and attracts interesting parallels to Orwell in 1984, although Bergman collapses this context at a personal level of slowly growing marriage wars. That is why countless basic and philosophical questions about Eva's and John's marriage are relevant and fundamental, while the threat and danger from outside tears open up the gap inside that has previously been infallibly covered with lambens. Intense allegory on fragile facades of civic conventions.
