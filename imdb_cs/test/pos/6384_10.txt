I saw this movie on a screener and his best movie I saw in loooong time. I loved it !!!! James Franco is sooo hot and he and Sienna Miller are the perfect couple. I don't want to give away what's going on, but they play a pair of newlyweds who embark on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls and pretty wild things happen on the way. I can't even say what reminded me, but go see it! I cried so hard, but I really loved it and I want to see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends were screaming too. I hope it works out soon - does anyone ever know? I'd really see it if I was you
