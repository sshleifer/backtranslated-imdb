"You were on your way up and you tripped over your skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. This sums up the plot of this story and the coming Leonard (YOUNG HUMPHREY BOGART) when his dream gets a turn from Carol's grandfather, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard has been working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and motor company have their ups and downs in this short 68-minute short time. Bogart has not yet developed a calm, tense style. Good performances of most support characters - her valet, his co-workers, the sister, the passengers on the road. Some adult themes because it was done just before they really enforced the movie code, but it's still tame compared to what's on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland directed the incredible "Flying Down to Rio".
