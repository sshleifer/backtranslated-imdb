This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's convincing, like the American justice system, it's scary. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film draws attention to the fundamental shortcomings of the legal process, that it is not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather who is better at court. In fact, the consequences of this case go beyond the possibility that an innocent person will be found guilty or guilty of a free man. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether offender or victim. But will they get it? The film is well stimulated, undervalued and one of the best documentary halls I've seen.
