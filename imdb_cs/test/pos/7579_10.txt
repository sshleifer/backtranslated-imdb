I have seen this film several times and still feel the excitement of the journey and the frustration of overcoming the obstacles that hinder the road with every viewing. It is more than a mere desire to find a home; it is about the basic human spirit of finding a way in the world, overcoming despair, how to confront characters that prevent our goals. The basis of these human endeavors is the challenge of rethinking the origin of life. While this film is filled with serious ideas, it has only so many comedy lines to keep the audience hopeful. It's surprisingly funny. Realizing the story is great! All this is packed with visually engaging animation. And he must see. <br /> <br />
