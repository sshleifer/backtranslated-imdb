When I watched this cheerfully retro but very entertaining career story, I was Joan Crawford first. All I originally thought was, "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his notorious photo!" Diane Baker and Hope Lange leave the cabin in Greenwich Village for about 34 minutes. As they walk down the street, you can see a section of the backside behind the Stonewall bar - a scene of epochal "riots" that are considered to trigger the modern gay rights movement. Speaking of Baker and taxis, I had to laugh when she got into one and tell the taxi drivers, "56th and Sutton Place, please - and be careful about the bumps." Can you imagine the driver's response to today's Manhattan? That says, of course, because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the fetus. But it won't stop her from JUMPING FROM MOTION when she finds out Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Well, they had to find a way to lose a child (1959 and all). Sue Carson is beautiful as Mary Agnes. Why was it her only movie? There are no biographical information in IMDb.
