"More", perhaps, is mostly remembered by the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd-in 1969 were not superstars yet. Actually, they created an album with movie music, no fan can miss it! But it's also the first film by German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it's a cult film. When it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the topic of drug slavery. The German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they seek sun and exoticism. But it's too high a price for love: it initiates it into drugs. In the 1960s there were no drug campaigns like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, in many drug-using environments, there was some kind of spiritual experience ... So it is quite surprising to see a film of that time that describes the horrible heroin experience. The film is simple, not vulgar at all, and shot in "cinema-verité" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "More" is a documentary about the end of the sixties and also a documentary about the end of hippie illusions.
