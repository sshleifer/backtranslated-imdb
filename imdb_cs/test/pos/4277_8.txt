My husband and I saw it last night ... It was amazing .... For once he was wrong when he guessed that the exciting end was ending. He moved very fast and the acting was excellent. Likewise, I adore Tom Wilkinson. As for me, he never did a bad movie. The above description of his hit hits the nail on his head ... Facial expressions are incredible. Even the scenic scenery is amazing. We just finished watching all Prime Suspect series and I believe the British have the opportunity to capture the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to get a few hours of in-depth entertainment.
