Therefore, it is important to talk about DVD release instead of film. Crapper Stories is a film that only one studio in the world can bring. The one that brought us innovative and original independent REAL films for 30 years: Three. This is a very special movie, because it will certainly be my favorite of the Troma productions, but it is released on the disc, which, thanks to what I have just said, is one of my most valuable and popular DVDs. Not just counting the countless Troms I own but counting the entire movie collection. The film itself is the result of a bad plan to produce a TV series that would be directed by a director who believed a considerable amount of money (especially Tromo) to create something amazing and release a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before (or being released, not sure) which at the moment). In order to avoid a huge investment in the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz decided to bring together a team of directors and actors and use material as the backbone of one film. One movie that really consists of two, in nice old stories from the mythology anthology myths, organized by Crapkeeper, who played Mr. Kaufman himself. But, as I said, it's not exactly my favorite of all my movies. This is largely due to the strange sense of discipline in the various sets, forgetting the tough Troma "no booze on the set", which was discovered by the furious Lloyd and other less esteemed staff Troma had at the time of filming. added scenes. All this allowed Mr. Kaufman to make a valuable product in the editorial office. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with worried added scenes to the already mutilated start-product, he created a not less masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances would allow the most beautiful filmmaker to be cut and it is certainly very entertaining, utterly confusing, loaded with the elements that made Troma great and certainly unique and of its kind. As a film, however, it is not as great as many other Troma productions. The independent film genius however made the DVD of this film so much more than the release of the movie with some extra is. In fact, when the film comes, the film is just part of the entire DVD, which, in its entirety, is a documentary about a difficult situation where serious filmmakers find themselves in a world that is monopolized by a few big people, not really allowing others players on their market turf. A documentary about the problems one has when trusting people that they are level, just to find that freedom is sometimes something that is hard to live and to realize that accessing the Budget when the boss is not around can harm you too who should know better. The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd knows it and does not want anyone to think it is. The whole commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr Kaufan's audio comments), a mix of humor, a grin for those who deserve it, and highly interesting information for anyone interested in making a film independently so that Watching a Movie Again with this commentary directly after viewing it on his own merit is so interesting that it's hard to stop. THE THICK BROWN LINE takes us behind the scenes in various places where Lloyd visits sets just to take over what he finds there. Sometimes we see him somewhat disillusioned, different from his appearance in other documentaries such as Fart of Darkness and Apocalypse Soon, both found in the MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE. Added scenes with James Gunn (who started his career in Minor just to find success as a writer who is now a director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone who started working with Troma) , later to be a national hero with his South Park series) to be entertaining and probably (as is much elsewhere on this release) reason for getting this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded with much more than I could mention here (including SECOND audio-commentary) it's one of the best Troma-DVD-editions.
