Tiny Tweet and Sly creep in train cages, who knows where. Swinging Tweety begins to release an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, hoping Puddy Tad will get it this time. Sly is trying a few funny tricks, but the spoiled sports conductor puts the bird in a safer place between the luggage. The cat's next attempt ends him in a coal-fired steam engine. And the chase is on. Of course there is also a bulldog, and stupid Sly just can't keep a big mouth shut. Another persistent cat trying old stacking suitcases-bit (twice) producing a Tex Avery payout would be proud. Unfortunately, for Sylvester, the bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even has a shape-shifting talent and produces huge clubs from his back pocket. Even Sylvesters' ability to overtake a speed train can save him when he is fired, Silver Streak style, several times in a row. Coming to Granny's new place (Gower Gulch, Population 86) The Cat's latest attempt involves cross-dressing. But you know what happens to men in clothes, they always get more attention than they negotiated. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
