If you've ever been, has a friend, or a child who is or has been skating at once, then watch this movie!. I've seen it several times and every time I see it, I'll get something new. It reminded me why I first skated. It reminded me of what skating brings to a person and I also found a help person who doesn't understand why skaters, well, skates. Certainly there is a very dark side to all seen, which film touch slightly. But rather it focuses on what is at the core of skating. Just a man on board, he does it because they love it. This film was so inspiring to me that I was skating again (I'm 32) and I wasn't so happy with my own in the years? .. Give it one go, you won't be disappointed.
