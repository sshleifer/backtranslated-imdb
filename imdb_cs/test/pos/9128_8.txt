How Good Is This Movie? It seems good enough that they're planning to remake it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. The movie is almost silent. These are the men of several words who prefer to speak for them. They live by code that controls their every move. There are some great actors in this movie - Alain Delon (Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love), and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio of Fistful of Dollars and several dollars more ). The film does not shine on them; They are together for a ride that Melville has for them. Melville makes the film; They make it better. You see Melville working in Ocean movies, but they just get an idea. It can't work like him. Big loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
