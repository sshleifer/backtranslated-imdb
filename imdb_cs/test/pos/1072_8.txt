Our Toronto reviewer has told you what you need to know about this movie (except that it needs editing - handmade technology is really old, really fast). I saw this film yesterday in Menerbes, France - we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and, of course, winemakers. They were all in Salle de Polyvalente, where they were crowded. Polite, patient, brilliant. Although my French is irritated, I got the main movie in the movie, but I noticed that viewers love "old" terrorists they're asking - esp. the one from a communist village in Languedoc. He got a lot of laughter. This is unusual in France - she laughs out loud. There is no doubt on which side of the terrorist war they are! SM
