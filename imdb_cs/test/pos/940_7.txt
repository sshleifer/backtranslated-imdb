I saw this movie by chance. It was shown very late, or more correctly very early in the morning on television. I woke up and had trouble sleeping and this movie came. It deals with a subject that is covered many times elsewhere (definitely not as good as Rita Education, despite a few more twists) and has a very predictable ending. Despite its very obvious shortcomings, I enjoyed the film and it was thanks to the acting of some of his players rather than the story or the work as a whole. . I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and we've seen him in many different movies, including: Dead Calm; Piano; Sirens; Children of the Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could play this part with his eyes closed. Some of the actors in my opinion were horrible Rose Byrne for example, and some of the elusiveness was rather heavy (all aboard a woman in empty lives all dressed up completely in white). However, two actors (who I didn't or did not remember, saw before) amazed me at Sin√©ad Cusackn and with Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. Especially he was very convincing and would like to see him much more.
