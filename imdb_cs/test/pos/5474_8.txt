Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film in which honors go to support John Malkovich. His criminal, who tried to assassinate the president, was first-class and trustworthy. It's not about reducing Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, nor Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a real White blockbuster. Chief of staff. Eastwood was great and I like any movie in which Russo is. The film presents the original five-time Oscar (Mal√®na, Bugsy, Untouchables, Mission, Heaven Days) Ennio Morricone. This in itself is worth your time.
