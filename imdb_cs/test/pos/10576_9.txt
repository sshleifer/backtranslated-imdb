I am usually disappointed with what the media call "lesbian" films: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women but eventually end up with men; ridiculously good looking women who just get each other to turn on men and so on. It is a credible love story that each of the members has enigmatically cast into the least supportive actors. In addition to having a very engaging central conflict, romance among the heroes is well developed and believable thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. I also saw TIPPING VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is much better than the first, both in character / conflict development and in acting quality. FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and so fun to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a great follow-up to BOUND.
