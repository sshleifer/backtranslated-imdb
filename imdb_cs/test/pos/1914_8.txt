Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Rudy Ray Moore plays as a pimp superhero for bad rights while encouraging MAN to travel. He has two enemies that no good Willie Green and sleazy mayor. Watch the Dolemite kick, punch, smack and pass his way through the screen. What's the name of the man? DOLEMITE! An interesting film that has paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. Rudy Ray Moore has sold more of his albums, made several cheap movies several times during the 1970s. Own production and marketing has provided a specific audience. Some people call it blacksploitation others say garbage, I say it fun. Dolemite followed a semi-sequel to Human Tornado and direct to the video The Return of the Dolemite 25 Years Later. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend, some cult classic! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the movie was properly crushed on the video, you won't see the microphones. Dolemite was cut to get an R-rating.
