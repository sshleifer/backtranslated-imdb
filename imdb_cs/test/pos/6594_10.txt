Considering the film as anything but a skateboarding document could not recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known figure of skateboarding) has created a film that not only deals with the birth of what we now know as skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport has emerged and gained wide appeal. In addition, his film is more personal: Peralta's first hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as an informed film investigator and participant-subject. In this role, he is a quintessential "participant-observer," while gathering a wide range of celebrities who have been an integral part of this movement and those who have been deeply affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a unique stylistic form of film and sound editing and narration (Sean Penn), and interviews take a rather original, incomprehensible form, similar to the anarchist, nihilistic spirit of surfing the pavement. The film exhibits the kinetic appeal of a lengthy sports, music video moderated by the archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
