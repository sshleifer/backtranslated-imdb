I normally hate period films. Living in England is a nightmare at the moment if you are allergic to period dramas - which I do. However, this one is the best. It doesn't take it seriously and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are great together, Liv Tyler is good anyway, though her English accent is reluctant !! The film has everything for someone who wants to go to the cinema to have fun. He has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well jokes will translate across the ocean, but hopefully they will. It would be a pity if American viewers lost this film. This shows that English filmmakers can produce something that doesn't involve continual swearing and sex. Both functions in this but in a balanced format. Iain Robertson's depiction of a well-prepared master is brilliant and the two brothers, who are also part of the upper class, are cheerful! <br /> <br /> As a trailer to The Spy movie that attacked me, tell the world .... "If you see one more movie" .... this spring to Plunkett and Macleane. It's fun, action lurve and of course Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for change!
