Anyone interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a lot of Texans to do it. Hollywood would never get it. There are so many fine things that Tubb does into the movie and may not have even thought about it, but it does a show. <br /> <br /> Guest portos are not seen as portraits at all. Every star fits perfectly and doesn't distract from the film. Many of the guests mix so perfectly that when credits are returned, you return through the movie to find the character. The Strait War is dead, nothing better in real life. <br /> <br /> The other half of the movie is completely different from the first one, it's a little "hokey", but that's fine. The story goes somehow. "Hokey" things are special after school, but they seem to be credible and natural. I've never heard anyone use Sonny Pruitt before other than I grew up. That was the icing on the cake for me. Certainly Collectible, Right There With Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and of course Hud.
