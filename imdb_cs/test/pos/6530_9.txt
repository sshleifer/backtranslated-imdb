This is a really cute movie. I had a massive sleepover (girls 10-11) and this movie totally loved it. They watched it twice! Do not let your ratings deceive you. You must be 13 years or older to rate an IMDb movie, eliminating the target audience of the movie. If you have a girl (or boy) between 7 and 13, I guarantee that they will enjoy this movie. The kind of middle-turned "Notting Hill" in high school. Aaron Carter plays the famous pop star who fails in his privately taught classes. His mother sends him to a "regular" high school with an ultimatum, "going through high school or without a summer tour". Taking the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy) befriends the smartest girl at school (Alana Austin) with plans to cheat on her. Look at the witty and insightful Janitor (another former pop star Lief Garrett).
