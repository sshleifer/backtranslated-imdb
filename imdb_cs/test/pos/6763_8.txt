It's an amazing movie about people. Strange people. The characters in the film have a very tragic past, so they have all their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the film's story meaningless; But that doesn't mean the film is worse, just better because it's filmed in a way that is fantasy, so nothing is real. This review may sound a bit weird, but then the movie is not quite normal ... It's also a lot of fun. If you haven't seen it, look. Enjoy!
