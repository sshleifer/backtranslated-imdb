Although this movie is not the funniest in the world, I think it's better than most. I mean, it was just a little laugh and a good feeling all around. It's not too often to see two old geezers who are having fun with their age and sincerely having fun with jokes. Walter and Jack had such great chemistry as friends / brothers in law. Only when they watched them dance, was it fun and you rooted them all the way, because we have to admit it or not, they still had a game for their age! : D I just loved the whole story of being able to go on and have fun no matter how old you are. I recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one. <br/> 7/10
