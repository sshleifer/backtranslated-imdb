This black and white film arrived at the Spartan film house of my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. At that time, many of our full-fledged comedy rides came from Denmark, so this film struck like lightning - I was crying with helpless merriment, ROTFL, as we have now said. OK, so some of the eyesight gags were actually recycled as "schtick," but how did the "barefoot boy with the brass face" know at the time? In any case, my favorite scenes had Jerry's unique brand of frantic clownism, as in the Hawaian boxing match. When I saw "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I still loudly lunged. It is true that without a nostalgia component it would probably be another fair comedy. But then, another movie that once had me in the stitch even more helplessly, Spike Jones, who featured "Firefighter to Save My Child", now seems to be dated and postponed as opposed to too short orchestra pieces and Doodles Weaver scenes. It must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis longer. For me, it's at least eight out of ten.
