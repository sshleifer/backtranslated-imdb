This DVD is usually sold for about $ 20. I wouldn't pay much for a DVD if I knew what I was getting, but no matter what, it's a pretty good disc. It shows the knot in all its glory, with footage of their concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other songs, including "Spit it Out" music video that was apparently banned by MTV. Slipknot, for those who do not know, is basically a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who show total chaos on stage, with machine-gun drums, a wailing guitar and singing that will tear your face and leave they want you more. For those who have never seen Slipknot, I can't recommend enough to get this DVD ... probably out of eBay or Amazon so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> Short, albeit a good example of Knot. Seven of Ten.
