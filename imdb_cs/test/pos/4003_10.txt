I know that many people said they didn't bother with this movie because it's not a good fighting film and hard with captions. This is a really lazy way to remember the movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie, you should find something different and learn to respect cinema as a form of art, which is a masterpiece. If you want to watch it, it's not really about fighting. Sometimes there are good combat scenes that are shot quite well with a good camera, but the story itself keeps the story together and is an important part. This is not a basic Kung fu movie. The story is really a central focus and not a fight, and the combination of these two is an excellent movie that is worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.
