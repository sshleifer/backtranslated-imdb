This movie is great - especially if you like visual art. The scenery that two daughters paint and photos are beautiful. Sometimes the story is funny and charming. <br /> <br /> People who like European movies and "art films" will love this movie. This is a truly artistic film - in fact, it has a lot of art in it. Go for rent. <br /> <br />
