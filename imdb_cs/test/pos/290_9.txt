Breathtaking at the best, interesting at the worst is Francis Ford Coppala's breakthrough epic film "Apocalypse Now", one of the most famous and famous films of the 20th century, and in my opinion it's the biggest movie that focused on engagement America in Vietnam. . <br /> <br /> What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from other films of the same genre. I grew up as a film enthusiast and with a special interest in war films. I have seen many films that have attempted to display Vietnam's "paintings" and "feelings," but they have not been successful. Films such as "Hamburger Hill" and "We Were Soldiers" fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by portraying "heroic battles" that are more than ever tainted by the zeal of Hollywood filmmaking. There are no battles in 'Apocalypse now, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests it is intended to reflect Vietnam's image through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film that explores and explores the human psyche when it is troubled by the absolute "horror" of the darkest military conflict of the last century. The full brilliance of acting (especially the silent Captain Willard Martin Sheen), along with the spectacular cinema (filmed in the Philippines) that provides key background realism makes the "Apocalypse Now" an unforgettable epic. "Apocalypse", which invokes a myriad of emotions and leaves us a mediator of meditation, is not for a cheerful movie viewer. It is a masterpiece that requires more insights to be fully appreciated.
