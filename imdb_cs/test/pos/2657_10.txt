This movie is not just good, its amazing. In addition to providing us with good performances, original conspiracies, fantastic special effects, sophisticated news and much more, it has been a totally invisible world to the public. This is the first science fiction film that takes us to the unknown space of our galaxy with such wonderful effects and thinks reality will burst, that the audience will remain without words. I am only 16 years old, and so I was brought up in the movies into the world of modern effects and 3D animations. Yet I was really, and I mean totally blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the advantages of this movie, the camera was in Kubrick's true style amazing and charming. You feel as if you are consumed on the screen and sucked into this surrealist world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me by my guards even though I saw ratings before I bought it. But this film has more to it than this. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, though I think there are some clear points about humanity (also the true Kubrick style). As mankind on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, therefore, there is no need for a computer, one of the humanities tools. As we look like children in the universe, we will learn to walk again, lose control of our instruments in zero gravity, breathe like fish from the water. At the height of evolution, we embarked on an endless adventure as simple primates. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can move on to these conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and spacecraft in the middle of the space. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty in many cases does not give viewers a legitimate respect. Kubrick wants to show us the beauty, and if we do not give in to it, we cannot enjoy the film as intended. It's not an ordinary movie, we can't just sit back and watch as we can with some other movies, it takes time, thoughts and above all a commitment and feelings to watch. All this is one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
