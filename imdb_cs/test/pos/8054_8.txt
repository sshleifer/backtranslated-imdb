** SPOILERS ** A shocking but true story of the horror that afflicted the border town of Alabama / Georgia Phenix when it was taken over by gangs of organized hoodlums who transform it into Sin City of South. With a crime soaring and no one to contact a group of concerned citizens get a well respected Phenix lawyer Albert Patterson, John McIntire, to run for the state district attorney's office. With Phenix, he does everything from intimidation to total murder, to voters get a form to nominate Patterson, still wins with 86 other state districts, including Phenix Russell County, which gives him a nod of just over 1,000 Voices. Terrified at what Patterson would do when he joined Phenix Mob Rett Tanner, Edward Andrews, he was hit by him. Patterson is shot to his office while driving, but his murderers are seen by Ellie Rhodes, Kathryn Grant, who will soon become, through an informant at Patterson's office, Tanner another person in the line to be murdered. What about Tanner & Co. she wasn't expecting, is that the last son of Albert Patterson John Richard Kiley received a message from Ellie about his father's murder before the boys could close her! The fact that the main mistake on Tanner's part ends in ending both his criminal organization and his freedom! A powerful documentary film crime movie with real people involved in events that have been given about 15 minutes, at the beginning of the movie, to tell their stories. This despite the fact that they were threatened to be murdered by the Tanners crowd, who was still alive at the time their talks were being filmed! The story of Phenix City on the front page of both state and national press gives Tanner a very negative publicity he tried to avoid. With now Alabama National Guard flooding into Phenix City's blood-thirsty and lackluster, in reluctantly confronting people with guns in their hands, Tanner Mob fizzled out of sight like the morning mist after the sunlight fell! And when John Patterson took the place of his murdered father as a state attorney general in Alabama, you can be sure that Patterson Mob saw his last days of pushing and killing people. All they can see in the future are the gray prison walls and the bars that will be their home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives. Very probably the most graphically violent movie coming out of Hollywood until then "The Phenix City Story" has not drawn any strikes in how a group of lawful and powerful criminals could turn a pretty American city into a living hell for everyone in him. None of these ruthless gangsters, who had not even thought twice when women and children were murdered, were spears. As far as the Phenix City Police Department is concerned, they had a better thing than enforcing the law they had sworn and paid for it to maintain. They were out with coffee and a donut, while their town was burned to the ground by gangsters like Tanner who had them in their pockets!
