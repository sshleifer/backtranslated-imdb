This movie is great! Being a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew I'd love this movie. And I love it. At the end of this year I finally got to buy a copy of this movie. But I was angry when I found it was shortened! So I'll watch the sale of cars for the original version. The film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who is trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. But Dennis heard one night in the pub and nicknamed! So Dennis turns the supergrass, but the problem is he doesn't know anything and starts to make lies and dig into an even deeper hole! The irony of all of this is that there is drug trafficking in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't as fun as I expected, but it's still a good movie with good laughs and a great soundtrack. It also has the best scene ever in British film (Robbie Coltrane's walk through the pier set to "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. from cast members or a British comedy fan see ASAP !!!
