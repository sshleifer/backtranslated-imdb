It is hard to believe that it was directed by Fritz Lang because he was mostly in charge of criminal drama and secrets. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and save Jagger's life forever. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to wire west. Jagger hires a lot of men to make sure he does it because he has to be afraid of Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of a man and Young is a telegraph expert who can't fire a gun but can ride. Scott meets his old gang who wants to stop them, but Scott doesn't tell anyone. It's a pretty good western and Lang should direct a few more westerns.
