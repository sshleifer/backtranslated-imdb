OMG, this is the best show in the world. It gets heavier than Jackass and CKY and is so fun and fun. I love the show. All 5 seasons are amazing, but for a quick summary: Season 1: - Great if you want to plan scout hunting, see if the house is torn and you're looking forward to starving. Season 2: - If you want to see them buy a Bam castle, watch a slayer concert, check out the miracle that is Mardi Gras and fun to get to it, see the demo derby and actually see and open Tree Top Casino. Season 3: - Great if you want to see probably the first Driveway Skatepark, Civil War, Johnny Knoxville, Pirate Ship and Don Vito who really won one of Bam's reindeer games. Season 4: - Great when you want to see them in Europe, get jobs, build state and bayou and Dudesons Season 5: - Great when you want to see them in Brazil, Ape's Birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappears, Bams Hummer is destroyed, playboy party in bams swimming pool and very latest Viva La Bam :(
