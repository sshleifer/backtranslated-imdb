I don't have much to say about how good this documentary is - it's a really amazing piece of the true story. The story is simple: a white tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida and a boy who is arrested is badly mistreated and brought to justice with a public defender and his family on his side. It is very fascinating and the Ombudsman is happy to follow in all his human ways - you cannot help but pull for the triumph of justice, and the end meets more than one might expect from a true story. It is a pity that more people have not seen this document, but hopefully you will find it. For those who are interested in racial relations in the United States and the true functioning of law enforcement and legal processes, it is worth to find this document. I give him 10.
