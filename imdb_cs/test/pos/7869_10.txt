"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite movies, Clint Eastwood, and a move away from his typical early roles. Director: Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood has collaborated on several films, was produced one year before Eastwood's directorial debut "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title considered for the film was "Pussy-footing Down at the Old Plantation", which fortunately was not used, otherwise I'm sure that funny jokes about the fact that it takes place in a girls' school would be hard to avoid. I first saw this film in one of my college classes in the mid-1970s and I was immediately taken with it. I only had an old battered VHS tape until I recently purchased a widescreen DVD that also contains a hilarious, horrible trailer that makes the film come across as "Peyton Place" soap opera, and expresses none of the creepiness of the movie. Interesting remarks: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight Universal Pictures to keep the end and win; And, the movie was billed as the standard Eastwood Western, which is certainly not. It is a gothic story about deception and horror that takes place during the Civil War, with the tone of eroticism and sexual tensions around the world. If you want to see the movie as it should be seen, then be careful when looking at the internet as spoilers explore it. Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier who is shot dead on Confederate land and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school. He saves him and takes him back to school, but instead of alerting the local patrol to his presence to be taken to jail, director, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwin (Elizabeth Hartman), their black Butler Hallie (Mae Mercer) and mostly teenage girls take him, treat him and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of ghost and gothic horror straight from the titles, as shown by the actual battle shots of the war, while Eastwood's voice is quietly heard singing the funeral song of that time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his encounter with a little girl who saves him determines the tone of his character and the tone of the film. You want to say more than it would spoil the surprise in this first scene. Much more about the movie itself could ruin anyone who didn't see it ... if you're in a ghostly gothic story, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in film and it is interesting to see him in an early role or any role where he portrays a character that is largely unsympathetic. Geraldine Page had a plum role in the film as a director, and I can't imagine at that time another actress was so good; a long shot could be Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could embody the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. Blue "as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character is another point of her short career" is in her prime position, gentle and masterful, but her subtlety on film was also part of her real life, committing suicide at the age of 45 I will end this review with this observation: one manipulative, lying man, the Yankee, is not for domestic misleading and libidinal Southern zero.
