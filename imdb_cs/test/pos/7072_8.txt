This film has the courage to suggest that it might be best to simply accept your life as it is and smile anyway. As one who is more enthusiastic about the idea of ​​taking responsibility for his life and moving forward, I felt struck in the face, but that's fine: I don't have to agree with a film that should love and respect him. Great playing Streep and Hurt, and everyone else really, and some wonderfully unpredictable scenes. Serious film. And take your hanky.
