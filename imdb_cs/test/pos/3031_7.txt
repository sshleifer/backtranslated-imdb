'The Cell' is the way to the mind of a serial killer and I mean it literally. The film is about the journey, the world that shows during this journey does not matter. In my opinion, this way through the mind gives such beautiful images, other things do not really matter until they are disturbing. In fact, the story is pretty good. We'll start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the catatonic boy's mind. It does not matter how it works, but it looks like a virtual reality. She and other scientists including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method can work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and talks to him there, in a world that is totally created by a boy. He hopes to allow him to do things that will eventually produce results. <br /> <br /> A real story. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just fired one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are in this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on a dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. There are two problems. 1. Carl just went to coma; he was ill for a long time. 2. His house and his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a way, this part of the story is quite standard. Things will get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine must go to Carl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is an unknown territory, a schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; she could die in Carl's mind. The tape about how the last victim was killed, the fate that this girl will have in about twenty hours, will make sure Catherine tries to get a place out of Carl's mind. It's the way this sick makes this movie more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who has made music videos before, returns to these videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists from beautiful and sometimes spooky images. For me, the visual style was completely new, the way the three kings had a new visual style a year earlier. If you like something like that, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But thriller and horror fans like this movie anyway. The story itself, without a great fantasy world, is good enough for it. I think you have to be a little open, of course, the events in our real world are not (yet) possible. Still, a very funny movie with nice ideas that look amazing.
