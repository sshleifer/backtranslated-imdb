Although HBO is designed for cable film, it is a pleasant film and a fascinating view of television television where back points appear. To allow the viewer to look behind the scenes of the Late Night Talk Show Wars in the early 1990s, when Jay Leno and David Letterman competed for a popular Tonight Show host position. Kathy Bates performs bravo as Leno's mercenary manager Helen Kushnick, and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman endures in the hands of TV managers. This is just as current when we consider recent events involving ABC's unsuccessful attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I saw this movie, it's still a pleasure for me to watch what I did when I first aired it. If it was to be released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
