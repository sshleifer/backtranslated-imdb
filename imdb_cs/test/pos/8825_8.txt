When I watched this PPV, I had high expectations because Smackdown is the best show in WWE, that's very good PPV because it's the last one before Wrestlemania. FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN 6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH A good way to start a match. It started a little slower at the start, but later the pace accelerated and the match became more exciting and fun. Benoit walks through and makes Joey Mercury to win the Hardy Boys & himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCHREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN OPEN KRUISERWEIGHT INVITATION MATCH FOR WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I am a very big fan of Cruiserweights, and I never felt disappointed when I watched them, especially in this match here. Chavo Guerrero Nail Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to win victory and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH-FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This wasn't a match, it was a comedy game, although it wasn't a clear match game, I still enjoyed a funny opponent. Finlay nails little Boogeyman with Shillaegh to get victory. Boogeyman doesn't deserve to be on PPV, and he doesn't deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOUR MATCH-KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL It was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be average, but it was really a competitive match. Hats at both men pulling a very fun match. Kane wins after Chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- PAUL LONDON & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR WORLD WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE WORLD Not so good a match, Deuce & Domino need more training for the match, & London & Kendrick are the only ones who keep this match at a fast pace. London and Kendrick keep their titles after Kendrick gets one of the guys to win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIX MATCH- BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR. ECW CHAMPIONSHIPS KENNEDY Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind until the match begins. It was a good match, but not very good. Lashley and Kennedy have some chemistry, but not enough to get a great match. Kennedy wins DQ, after Lashley slips him with a chair, then attacks him with a chair all the way to the entrance area. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN PRICE & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the biggest match I've ever seen. Hats for all these men {yes Batista} for pulling as close as a 5 star main event. All four of these men played their games very well because it was a great and fun team match. Batista turns his back to the Undertaker spine-busting him, then leaving the ring that prompts Michaels to nail Sweet Chin's music, then Price to F-U's nail for a tough combat victory. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I don't know why everyone says this PPV isn't good enough or it's boring, I just don't get it. It's a great PPV that Smackdown always adds. Great PPV really. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give him 8/10 & B +
