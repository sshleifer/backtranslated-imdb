That's right, we have a 2008 movie with the themes of "Brief Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County". It is essentially a story about lost love, redemption and the triumph of the human spirit. The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Here Gere performs such limited performance as a doctor who seeks meaning after the patient dies on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son who broke away from her wandering husband and suffered the loss of his father in the same year. Scott Glenn steals the show in one scene with Gere. He is a broken heart husband and recounts his love to his departing woman, bringing tears to your eyes. Fresh from her triumph as an affirmative mother in "Doubt", Viola Davis appears to be an understanding friend in the movie and literally hangs her hair in a somewhat benign performance.
