From start to finish there must be a great courage to handle the theme of death with a smile, especially when two funeral parlors struggle for market control: a classic salon and a revolutionary where every funeral is a show, lead Christopher Walken, a delicacy in the visionary American mortal. But the rest of the cast is also great, and it is another success that only the UK can do. What is surprising is the Naomi Watts cast file, which hits another metamorphosis (including accent). It always seems to be a paradoxical smile that could be taken from a movie that could be called "Four Funerals and One Wedding", but you will understand when you see it.
