I don't get all the bad reviews. I believe this film was one of the best in the series of puppet masters. Thanks to the low budget, it is possible to understand why special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not terrible. Greg Sestero has brought a lot of charism to Andre Toulon. He has great potential and I hope to see him soon. And although cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. I am a big fan of the puppet master and I was expecting blood and gore from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored with the whole process of watching the Retro Puppet Master. So, if you ever get the chance to see this movie, don't take it automatically as unworthy of your time. Give him a chance. Maybe you like it.
