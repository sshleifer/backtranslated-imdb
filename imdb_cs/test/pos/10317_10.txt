I don't want to repeat what everyone else has noticed, but I'll just say this: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says they've loved Curly the best ... but I'll put BRIDELESS GROOM against each of the other Stooges shorts. <br /> <br /> I think it's the funniest from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable. Off-key singer ... Christine McIntire's "Cousin Basil" routine, and of course JP Emil Sitka is highlighted, but only around the perfect timing of Stooges "and great writing too! <br /> <br / Nuff said.
