He saw the film today and thought it was a good effort, good news for kids. A little predictable. The book was better, gave more details about the area, the ore about the environment, and how the children revealed the plot. I think Hiassen's crooked humor is better than the movie in the book, but there were plenty of funny moments in the movie. It's probably too slow a pace for children under 6. He loved casting Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And the baby owls were lovely. I wonder how they managed to shoot. The film showed a lot of Florida at its best, making it very attractive. Do I imagine it, or did Carl Hiassen make a short look?
