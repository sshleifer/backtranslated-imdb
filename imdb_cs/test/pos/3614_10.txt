A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home vanity and cruelty to wars regardless of what they are called Reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz was quite impressive, but it is to the older Greek characters who go the highest praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes seem a bit long at times, this movie will be a difficult Oscar contender.
