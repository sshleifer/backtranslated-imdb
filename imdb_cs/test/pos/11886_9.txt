If you're looking for a kung fu movie, look elsewhere. While there are combat scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who seeks to find her way in Americanized Canton. Unlike most "kung-fu comedies", action scenes are used to enhance comedy, instead of other ways. Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung fu movies, where stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of some great drama about honor and reverence, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start to beat each other. Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who married an older landowner so his businesses could not fall into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he dies, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. The basis of irony is that although Cheng is at the same age as Ah Tao, her way is more similar to her state as his step-great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely poor), plays guitar and attends costume parties, Cheng completely fails when he tries to adapt to his lifestyle in Canton, complete with makeup, revealing dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui has won "Best Actress" at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also, this is probably the best performance of Hsiao Ho. His chemistry with Hui is notable, and although he continued to have a saved career in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he has a perfect combination of athletics and comedy. As romantic tensions and intrigues build in the second half of the film, his entire face changes. It is no longer easy to go through life without care in the world. He becomes a straight man and his cohorts Kramer, Elaine and George. My only complaint is how suddenly the comic aspects of the film disappear during the conclusion. The film goes from direct farce to dramatic intrigues with little but change in random music. But there is some symmetry. The film focuses on intrigues, focuses more on Lau Kara Leung's character and ends in this way. However, the final scene returns to the comedy roots of the film, which concludes both aspects of the film.
