Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only aired the first 2 season in India but I watched the rest on DVD or read it online. it is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not fall over her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. Chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who play Lorelai and her daughter Rory, is really great. All performances are excellent and the characters, though extremely unpredictable, are still believable. the stellar inhabitants show all the fun bizarre of little urban life, which contrasts with the infinite snobbiness and social norms that make up Lorela's parents' high social life. on the one hand there are dance athons and a fire festival, while on your hands you have cottages, DAR meetings and cocktail parties. all the characters evolve a lot and there's a happy ending for more or less all. There are dramatic elements, but also a lot of humorous humor. Rory's friends are incredibly hot, just like her friend Lane. Basically it is a cool, funny, very satisfying show that embraces all aspects of life and gives you the feeling that if you work hard enough to wait patiently, you get what you want, even if it wasn't what you intended.
