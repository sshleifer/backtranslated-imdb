This film offers you a fascinating trip through one of today's most interesting cities - Istanbul - and its musicians. Don't expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. German musician Alexander Hacke and member of the cult group "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travel to Istanbul to meet the music scene. His thin voice, which he experiences, is a guide to the film. But mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets various artists from Istanbul talk - and of course their music. You will meet many celebrities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people playing many different styles of music. But this film not only introduces you to the sound of Istanbul. It also attracts a convincing picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has overtaken the past decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor but never with respect. Everyone shares passion for music and faith in her power. Once again Akin shows his talent to show diversity easily by bringing you to completely different music scenes. After his award-winning feature film, "Head on" Faith Akin, "Crossing the Bridge" proves that he is equally able to touch, entertain and guide his audience in the documentary. If you've never been to Istanbul, you'll want to go there after you've seen the movie.
