As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) murder the vengeful assailants Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality is totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite opera soap. In a state of total denial and deception, Betty escapes physically and mentally from her dissatisfied, little urban life to seek "Dr. David Ravell ”(Greg Kinnear), a handsome and loving hero“ The Reason for Love ”, a soap opera at the hospital and made in Los Angeles. Immunity to reality, Betty comes to L.A. and becomes "sister of Betty" as she tries to belong to the world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angry Charlie and Wesley are watching Betty, convinced he's a dangerous witness who also knows about his compromise negotiations with Del. with the obvious hypocrisy and violence that surrounds it. Sister Betty clearly defines the difficult life of the protagonist and justifies the tendency of her character to turn away from reality. Thus, while offering commentary on the popularity of soap opera within the film, Sister Betty also makes a commentary on widespread dependence on television and his personalities. In addition, Sister Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of her protagonist's mental state, especially in those scenes where she can't distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell ", character and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to witty misunderstandings that emphasize the magnitude of her vicious state. Despite these achievements, however, Sister Betty suffers from the worrying characteristics of the narrative. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of recognition or viewer acceptance might initially experience. Similarly, although the Del scene creates Del as a nasty man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers overcomes all the humiliation and violence he has caused to his wife Betty. Finally to the end of the film, Charlie undergoes embarrassing transformations as an obsession for Betty develops; an obsession that results in noble feelings of love and that ultimately destroys it. Since the role of characters as victims is lacking in coherence, the processes of victimization of stories appear to be random and irrelevant. All in all, Nurse Betty's uncertainty - which is much more than creating tension - weakens her characters and pollutes her conspiracy. <br /> <br />
