Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He's a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. At the end I was so sad. I won't ruin the end but wow. Girls are so bad. His girl was bad. If Eddie was my husband, I'd never say that. The Mobsters were scary. The moral story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. And Eddie tells your girlfriend he's mine, she should move eggs! I would suggest seeing a movie. Why? I told Becasur. He had eyes on the screen. My sister also loved it, so I'll see it again because my friends want to see it and it's worth seeing twice. Peace, Happy New Year!
