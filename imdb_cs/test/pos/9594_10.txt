I got it on VHS, but it's not a great copy as I watched it 2 or 3 times a year since 1999. I'm also worried that the "interior" will throw it out of VHS annual cleanup. My brother and I (Late 30 'are still laughing at continuing this fantastic show.Tim Healys Lucky Cup Hat and telling the apprentice YOU CAN ALSO EXCEED (Shooting, Forwarding, etc.) and it turns out to be Peter Beardsley As a Leeds fan, I have to laugh at the empty documentation at Bostock before the final cup (or S ** t?). The reason I came today was that my Bro wanted it for Christmas so ITV please bring it to DVD Come to The UnderFelt Men !!
