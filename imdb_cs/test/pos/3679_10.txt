What a great movie, made even more by the fact that my wife and I stumped him so badly, surfing the canal at a nice frozen day in northern Texas. Kathy Bates is in her habit of leading the cast of very normal and human characters based on one of the most beautiful films we've ever seen. Why this film didn't get the attention it deserves in its 2002 release is hard to understand. Why was it the head and shoulders above so many boring bits of garbage issued with more fanfare and attention being observed when watching. Obviously, we, as the public, are forced to feed what powerful and influential he considered "great and wonderful", while real gems like "unconditional love" can radiate a truly enjoyable cinema to all those who submit. Rent this movie ..... you won't regret it!
