I've been waiting for 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teenager and over 20s. I recently found a reasonable dvdr price and watched it this morning. It was in a widescreen, probably even 70mm print, stereo, colors were pretty good, very little fading, certainly not remastered, but I'm very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's pretty good. I'd say it's great, though there are great scenes in it. Maybe Premminger might not have been the right director, but I'll say it. For me the center of the movie was a hurricane scene. Amazingly staged by Premminger. One of the great meteorological scenes of all time. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the acting scene is better than the music scene, not that the music sequences are bad. Not at all. But something was missing. Perhaps it was the fact that there were no close-ups and very few medium shots. It was almost like watching a theater production. Maybe it was a feeling that Premminger was after. Eventually, maybe it wasn't the right choice, but that's the way it is. It's far from the destroyed film. I say not everyone loves singers on one soundtrack. I always have. They're perfect for this movie. I love singing voices. Actors lip-sinking are excellent for the most part. I just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively. Sportin 'Life's two numbers are fine, but intimate numbers don't feel intimate. He feels ... far away. Despite this, you cannot deny the power of music. And finally, that's what comes loud and clear. Again, maybe what Premminger was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he was working with. I believe he had the right idea, but maybe he went too far in that direction. Acting is amazing. The top kudos goes to the great Brock Peters, who acts and sings part of the crown. It's a final grin. We want him to leave poor Bess himself, and he doesn't. Sammy Davis Jr is proud, arrogant and ugly as he is. The classic portrayal of Sportin's life, Sam Davis Jr., is that neat devil and very charismatic. Probably, Davis's best acting performance. Poor Bess just can't handle two bad men. I'm glad Hermes Pan gave Davis the dance number to do. Dandridge and Poitier, reportedly not feeling like they're in the movie, are really very nice. I don't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. Yet it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. Still, I think they should both be proud of the work they've done on this movie. They both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye. Their characterization, where they are very 3D and believable. Sidney Poitier's Porgy, however, looks almost in place in a line of catfish. I couldn't help thinking that Mr. Braithwaite was in "That Sir With Love", very educated and well-behaved and spoken, fell for hard times. Probably wouldn't be the first choice for Porgy, but hey, he was a huge star at the time, so why not? Dorothyina Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, even more vulnerable this time. Carmen was probably the most surprising part of her. Very good movie really, these are two sticks of what I would call a classic. It just doesn't make the ultimate classic stage. On Earth, however, there is no reason why Gershwin's property has decided that this beautiful film, with all its shortcomings, will remain hidden from the public as it should. Premminger may have made some strange choices as a director, but the film is nothing to be ashamed of and embarrassed for someone to deal with. This is what it is, and there are far worse films than those that are embarrassing on DVDs and theaters. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
