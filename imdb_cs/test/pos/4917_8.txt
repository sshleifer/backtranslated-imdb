Although sexiness is a variable quality for most of us, I can't remember the movie that did what it does for me. This brought me to the well-known realm of desire and desire. All the compulsive attraction, uncertainty about the result, the tangible fear and excitement that thrilled this state of excitement, brought this flick of fever. So French and what I consider brave! No matter what your orientation is, I think the danger of persecuting your desire is brought to full queue and centered ... much more, say, than with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut".
