This film marked the end of the "serious" era of Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello met with the monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate but amusing attempt to revive the classic monsters Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster and Dracula of one "last" time. I say desperately because in the previous movie "House" Frankenstein, "both Dracula and the Wolf Man are to be killed according to how the vampire and the werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula by the Sun, and the Wolf Man by the Silver bullet). Yet there is no explanation in Dracula's house. This film could play as a kind of prequel to the House of Frankenstein if the Frankenstein conspiracy monster would not be a sequel chronologically to the House of Dracula from the House of Frankenstein, and if the wolf man didn't get cured. Then there would be no holes for the plot. But because it is not, the plot of Dracula and the Wolf Man does not make sense. However, ignoring these hole holes, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror that is fun to watch. He has many high points. Especially when he saw the wolf heal. I know I just said it shouldn't be included, but it was nice to see him cured after that time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada," on the piano then suddenly played a spooky tune when it was very scary under Dracula's spell. Dr. Transformation Edleman in Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde was also very good. And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man together, one "last". time. <br /> <br /> *** off ****
