17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a movie that most viewers agree on is average, I am amazed at how many different interpretations were offered. . I have only briefly searched the web and have already been informed that "More" is: romance in the 19th century style, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple film full of boring people and interest only Pink Floyd completes. So it is fair to say that critical income is mixed. I would say that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's directorial debut in 1969 are enough proof that "More" is something other than a fairly average movie. Of course, this is not even a masterpiece. I went to "More" as I did "Easy Rider" and Antonioni's "Blowup" - as a "time-capsule" movie, despite the differences in tempo, style, and content between these movies. They all have similar shortcomings - either vague or utterly improbable characters, acting that seem somewhat detached from reality, relaxed adjustments, and sudden ends that have left the audience indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet audiences in the middle of the road - they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem unless we have a souvenir of experience. Fortunately, "More" offers the viewer some truly memorable images, sounds and designs, and that's what saves him. Stefan is a young man who comes to Paris freshly from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him when he falls into a group of French hips, accompanying them to the devastating cold and confident parties and bars before meeting Estelle. Both characters are sexually and romantically engaged and promise to follow her on Ibiza, against the advice of her friend Charlie. This is where Icarus comes into play - she's the sun, he's watching her. Now you can be able to estimate how it all ends. Ibiza is an idyll so far from the busy urgency of superhuman Paris that naive Stefan knows to be on good things. Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has less desirable underbelly. Until now, I didn't care about any of these characters and their disparate persecution being really free somewhere, but once this action is reduced to these two things, the film is suddenly angry. During one single eloquent exchange of dialogue in the remote villa they occupy, the place where their volatile love crystallizes, I went from watching with faded optimism to utter enragment. I can't think of many other movies that did it. The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in that it can be seen from intimacy defining life to disillusionment and cruel coldness. On the terraces, rocks and beaches they take a lot of medicines and a cort. Their lives revolve around nothing but themselves and beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. Their situation is the essence of freedom, emotional openness and self-experience for a while. But Stefan is not in control, and that is more than just his future in Ibiza. Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, intimacy and "More". It's one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito netting around Estelle's bed and their hallucinogenic vigor around the windmill (which appears on the front of the soundtrack). The scene in which they take the acid to escape from the heroin exit is an illustration of the basic shortcomings of the pair - they cannot "land" without falling. Maybe they came too close to what they wanted. Stefan never touches any family or friends before arriving in Paris. We're supposed to have no idea where he is. While other 1960s Counterculture films reside in forgiveness, abundance, media and voyeurism, Schroeder has instead introduced us to a single-man story that returns to a small corner somewhere in the world and disappears quietly.
