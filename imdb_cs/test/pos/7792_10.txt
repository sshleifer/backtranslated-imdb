I saw this movie about 20 times. Jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I look at it, they fall from my chair. The lead role is played by two of the best actors Salman Khan and Aamir Khan. Although Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got a better role (clever guy) in Salman Khan's movie matches and sometimes better performance as a dumb guy. All characters are unforgettable. This movie is full of cheerful one-liners and funny situations (a little too stupid probably). Don't try to find logic in this movie. Let your brain rest for a while. I promise it will be an experience we will remember.
