I don't know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I thought this movie was one of the most expensive Japanese epics. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or for that thing, the day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. What I know about movies, most of the catastrophes in movies are essentially driven by the movement of a mill asteroid or one of the global warming. This was a different course. The course of natural remedies where the earth's crust begins to erode to such an extent that it takes another piece of land with it. Science teams had to do a way to stop erosion that could go far and dive Japan. In most cases, it would simply be called a tectonic shift on steroids. I found out that the characters are attractive in every way, from a child who has lost her mother, only to face her own demise among unknown friends. Or a rescue girl who does everything she can to save lives in the face of a disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind to not be such a brave devil and go with him to safety, just to become a hero and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world just enveloped them just to forget them when the world turned its back on the Japanese people who called for help. This was a great movie in all aspects. Dick is trying to say that this movie was not made from Hollywood, that it was made in Japan, that it had characters that compete with other actors around the world, that the effects are very beautiful, as it was mentioned, but it is all it has expected and nothing else. He misses the vision of what is important for everyone, and why this film has every element of feeling, grandeur and humanity. I thought this movie was at its highest speed, and I saw many movies about disasters to know that Japan's Sinks is perhaps one of the most original and exciting projects I've witnessed. I really hope Shinji Higuchi will do another of these movies. And by the way, I'm not a Japanese, although in many ways I wish I was. I am a Canadian, born and raised. A passionate film enthusiast in all aspects. Prejudice visions are bitter and not worth acknowledging. Dick, you should look with a more open heart and mind, not just looking for eye candy that makes movies, looking for what's more important, and understanding it. It may not be Americans, but the Japanese have recently driven off the market for some of the most breathtaking and daring films. Which is why he spent 25,000,000 just what the doctor ordered. You heard the truth, 25,000,000 to make this movie. Now tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because there were no American actors?
