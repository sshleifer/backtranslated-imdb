Andreas comes to a strange city. He doesn't remember where he came from and how he got there. He is ordered to come to work and get his own apartment in the city. All his co-workers are kind and polite to him, they say and say hello when they go past him. But later on, Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. He goes home from work and sees people wearing gray suits, clearing the bloody clutter of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim who has thrown out the window. This procedure is carried out with a calm mind as if emptying garbage. The following day, Andreas meets a suicide victim in full life. More and more, Andreas is discovering the heartless atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen could be the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. Original, artistic direction is usually lacking in Norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. The story is also very original and can even be called postmodern horror, because the film is a terrifying idea to cope with a world that is totally ruthless. and the more you try to fulfill your life in this city with the meaning, the more it becomes insignificant. I am fascinated by how the director manages to create a sense of universe, a nightmare that you simply cannot escape with death. <br /> <br /> Check it out, it's really worth it! I gave it 9 out of 10.
