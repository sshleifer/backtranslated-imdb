Over the years, I seemed to have missed this picture of Ronald Reagan, and given his recent transition to the big screen in heaven, it has recently been shown on television. This is a great low-budget black and white movie from the late 1930s, but it's very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims in this particular timeframe. I was surprised by the role of Ronald Reagan, (Eric Gregg), "The Killer's, '64, playing in this film, along with the great veteran movie star, Sheila Bromley, (Nona Gregg)," Nightmare Circus ", '73, It was great a film that showed Ronald Reagan as a very young man who at that time reached for Hollywood in his Hollywood career.
