After traveling around the world, it has happened to me that Australia really misses one thing that other countries have: history. Fortunately, or unfortunately, Australia did not start after the war, had no civil war, and most of its political history is rather ... boring! Nothing "big" has been identified as a turning point in Australia's history ... until the dismissal of Whitlam by the Governor-General of Australia, John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move on to the next one. This is in favor of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. As time went on, it became obvious that Australia was able to stand on its own two legs. Therefore, the United Kingdom has granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. Australia's law and policy would no longer be administered directly from the British; rather, Australia would be controlled by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so forth is largely modeled on the British system. This change was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no lists of rights), their two parts are "pro-crown" that have been delivered here and remain to this day. These are more or less considered "reserve forces of the crown (King / Queen of Great Britain)". The first group of sections concerns the creation of a Governor-General. In short, the Governor-General is considered to be the Queen's Chief Representative in Australia and is described as an "executive" branch of the Australian Government. When the Australian Parliament approves a piece of law, the Constitution states that it becomes law only when it is signed by the Governor-General. As such, Govenor-General is considered by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper to perform an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. In theory, the Governor-General may refuse to sign a law approved by the Australian Parliament if he thinks it is appropriate. For example, if Parliament passed a law that would allow the police to shoot any Australian over the age of 50 (of course hypothetical), then GG could refuse to sign and become a country right. However, this power is theoretical and has (so far) never done. By "convention" (which is the buzzing word of events leading to release), the governor-general practically behaves at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes the law and the prime minister briefs the governor-general to sign it, will be almost always without questions. In fact, the "convention" governor-general acts in accordance with the council provided to him by the prime minister of the day (and prime minister alone). The second aspect is Section 64 of the Constitution, which states that government ministers hold the Governor-General's "joy". The events of 1975 - included in this film - gave rise to a precedent in this particular section: if the Governor-General is somehow "dissatisfied" with the government and / or the prime minister, this section seems to allow him to legally cast the government (which happened in in 1975 ... the title of "release" movie. "Whether" at the Governor General's pleasure "can be interpreted as" the unlimited right to dismiss "is a controversial point that has led to somewhat heated exchanges between Australians at that time - especially considering that governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia. Now that this aspect of the background is out of the way, let's go back to the film's discussion. It was good. The pace was patient but not at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. The events dramatically overshadowed and, most importantly, did not represent their views from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though the final text before the credits suggests that the filmmakers probably did not approve the governor's decision to reject Whitlam's government. But overall, I wouldn't describe the film as a bias in either direction or direction. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was practically in place. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and apparently read the books and writings of all the major players involved. There were a lot of finer details that were somewhat skipped, mainly because it took a long time to explain and eventually had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them. Furthermore, I think it was difficult to re-create the public sentiment after the Vietnam War, but Noyce almost withdrew it. Finally, I was glad that this film was trying to increase the policies of both sides without becoming analytic, obsessive or judicious. In addition, everyone we raised, such as Connor's gas pipeline, was of great importance to the story. The filmmakers realized that their job was to tell the story of the events leading to dismissal and not to present political support or opposition to policies and perspectives. That was clever because it meant that the film could not be accused of biasing one party's policy. Dismissal is probably the most incredible part of political history in Australia in a short life. I'm glad she was crystallized in celluloid. Basic browsing for all Australians.
