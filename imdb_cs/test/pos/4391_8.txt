I originally saw it a few years ago when I was sitting on the couch and got stuck on HBO. With a remote control, I decided to go with him and waited for the unhappy movie I had avoided for a year. So it started and I wasn't very optimistic about it, but after ten minutes I laughed. The opposite, as I expected. The comedy was clever, acting quite good reasoning, the cast worked very well together, and the story (though slightly embarrassing and fake) was actually quite funny. Three condemned brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually go looking for their wealth. The film takes place in the 1930s. Along the way, they meet a number of funny and interesting charities. They all have a different story or success they want. Most of the movie may seem random. Some may say it was unnecessary and boring, but if you look at a smart comedy (and sometimes silly) that is integrated into the movie, you will surely enjoy it. I liked the performance of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Everyone was doing very well in their roles, they worked great together. But to end it, "Oh brother, where are you art?" it is a clever, funny and cinematic adventure that I would not let go.
