Cleopatra (delicious Monica Bellucci) is questioned by Cesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a luxury home for Cesar within three months, without any delay. He calls Numerobis architects (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered with gold if he fulfills his mission, or becomes a crocodile if he fails. Numerobis asks for help by Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, especially the part where Obelix and Pirates take part under Red Beard. However, the script and the director should note that French is not a universal language like English. Therefore, jokes with words (for example in Austin Powers movies, for example) do not work well for people strange to the French language. French and French-speaking people will certainly like these jokes, but it doesn't make sense to me that they don't speak French. My vote is seven.
