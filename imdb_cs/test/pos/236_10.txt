That was the breakthrough of Gene Kelly, and that in itself makes it unforgettable. Put Rita Hayworth as his love affair and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd of pleasure, which is exactly how it turned out. Kelly plays Danny McGuire, owner of a nightclub in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "bad side of the songs" in the 40s), whose star attraction and love is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is beautiful and even plays a double role as Rusty's grandmother and Rusty. Rusty has a chance in big time thanks to John Coudair's machinations (Otto Kruger) who romanced and lost Rusty's grandmother. The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose, at the expense of her club because she has a chance of success that she can't give her. But naturally this is not what Rusty wants, because, as usual in the films of that time, the right person is the only thing on the girl's mind. There are no surprises, but everyone does their thing well. Kelly makes the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. He was a master of this kind of dance, and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely that it seems to be in two places at once. Melodrama is a little thicker and there are some inappropriate links to the war that are thrown in that they do little but provide an opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this film to the next level. That was before he became a mega-star and too smooth for his own good. The basic edge of rawness to its nature lends it credible and almost wistful air. Kelly's character in 1980 "Xanadu" was also named Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning that filmed the end, an amazing run for a dance genius. This movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
