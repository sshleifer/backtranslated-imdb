This is not so much a show of two sisters because it is a discussion of some smaller details of the plot, so I suggest you not read this review if you haven't seen it because it will absolutely destroy a few surprises for you. In a way, the story of two sisters is far from the original, at least from a purely superficial point of view - some of its iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while the story itself (especially what Brendt Sponseller calls an aspect of "rubber reality") "The Story" reminds of films like the Fight Club (the main character communicates with someone created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (the character creates an alternative reality in psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically every movie under the sun , which deals with mental illness, plus Amenabara (Other, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (especially with regard to the torturous nature of memory), et al. Fortunately, all these similarities will not hurt the overall emotional influence of the film and I personally found the Story of Two Sisters an extremely mobile and rewarding experience. Many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of narration, but I personally have found a story to be quite self-explanatory, even though it is partly portrayed in a non-sequential manner. The story becomes confusing for some only because, in the middle of the last third, the story changes from a purely subjective setting (ie, Soo-Miho distorted perception of reality) to objective, with a retrospective at the end explaining the origin of the Soo -Is nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. A shift in emphasis is needed to keep some people on guard, but structurally I have found that it is somewhat reminiscent of Mulholland's drive mentioned above (even though it is not a perception of reality through a dream, but one's own schizophrenic tendency - something that is, in return, recalled another film, Lynch, Lost Highway. To be honest, I don't pay attention to the Story of Two Sisters as a film Horror as such, but rather a tragic story of a family breakdown and a sincere look at the mental illness of the character (and I add that the fans of the psychoanalytic film will love this film). In addition, cinematography in the Story of Two Sisters is incredible and visually it is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen on this side of Wong. Kar Wai is 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception and I expect to see more of the four main actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then East Asian movies without a great soundtrack seem to be little and far between. It is very likely that some people will look around the finer artistic points of the Two Sisters story and simply reject it as "one more Asian horror movie", ignoring its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach. But then everyone. If you can ignore some of the false aspects of the movie and simply take it for what's in the heart, ie an extremely tragic, heartbreaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.
