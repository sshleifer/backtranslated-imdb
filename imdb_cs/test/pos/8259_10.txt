This film is perfectly adapted to the screen and is very faithful to Mary Webb's novel. In addition to the exceptionally talented rising star, Janet Mcteer as the leader and one or two established actors, the film used mostly little known names. But the drama was all the more convincing. Social and personal tension is almost palpable, and I felt as if the cast reacted to each other's character as if they were doing it in real life. I saw that one commentator asked if Janet McTeer really had a nasty lip, a testimony of how good her characterization was. I saw it on TV when it was first mentioned, recorded, then unfortunately the tape was lost. But it remains clear as anything in my mind. If you have any kindness for the social period, it is absolutely necessary.
