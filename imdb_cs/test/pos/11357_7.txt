I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had a strange minute or two, with accents that are a little off, but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American who does this accent. In addition, I rarely saw a British actor handle an American or Canadian accent, with the exception of Colin Farrel in the Minority Report. This movie is a small movie and was fun. No, it wasn't the Hollywood production market, but frankly, I'm a shit. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was definitely worth the rent. The main character is a spoof on other hard British gangsters. At least I saw it. If you are going to expect $ 100 million production you will be disappointed. Enjoy what it is - a little funny movie.
