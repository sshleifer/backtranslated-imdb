The fact that this film was shown in London's Barbican suggests that the press had to be sufficiently acceptable for such a performance. The question is why isn't this long lost and important movie available on DVD (or even VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and the US for many years hoped to see this film if, for a reason other than the beautiful music written by Sergei Prokofiev. What does one have to do to get such amazing production as is available to the wider public, not just Barbican patrons in London? For many years, he has devoted himself to listeners of Prokofiev's music and has realized this film, PLEASE, someone 'out there' will do the right thing and bring it like a DVD.
