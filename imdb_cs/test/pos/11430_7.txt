Based on the novel Rejection by Ermanno Rea, basically the story is about a slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who can be seen as a villainous king in Prince Caspian, and was a leader in Bella Martha.) And a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually set out on the wrong foot, the former chastising the latter for her inaccurate, and the slow translations of what he wanted to tell the Chinese delegate who bought the equipment that is flawed. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing that is rare these days, to inform potential buyers about the defects as well as the complexities that their purchase would bring, and being concerned that the deal was still going. ahead, he takes the time off to craft a folder that would put things right. But it also means traveling to China to find an elusive machine that turns out to be well hidden, and seemingly disappearing without a trace. With an initial reluctance to use Liu Huy, they set out to search for a treasure from the city to the city, which brings us to less visible landmarks of China, far from Beijings and Shanghais, to cities like Wuhan, with industrial backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear smoke stacks. that dot the landscape. The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance. Along the way, the usual footage of such travel-style films, such as learning culture, ideals, food, and basically understanding that the world is free of foreigners, comes into play when only one of them tries to connect. While there are hints of some romance between the two, seldom did it become a point point, maybe late in the movie (hey, opposites attract, aren't we?) <br /> <br /> In addition to large industrial factories and factories, we get to see different home Industry like seamstresses working in sweat like environment, and I believe cotton too, along with noodle making. As a film he gave me the opportunity to travel without leaving my place to watch, and I appreciated him for not having passed the judgment for moral reasons for exploitation and gladness. And also where to film to engage in a dialogue based on the characters' native languages, rather than (and I will not name names here) any other film / intercultural collaboration where dialogue is forced to be dubbed and came unnaturally and truly outrageous. Some might consider supporting figures to be too kind, still opening their weapons and doors to strangers, but I would like to imagine that people in most rural areas tend to be more honest, friendlier and basically not getting caught in a rat race to tread on others, or trampled. If there is a message that the film needs to be taken away, in addition to the fact that I have mentioned that the world is free of foreigners, I recall that some of the things I consider important may not be for others . Importance is something that one builds on something else, and its foundation really depends on how we define the boundaries we set. So, given our ultimate life, I think I should light up a little, live, and live and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance might be bliss.
