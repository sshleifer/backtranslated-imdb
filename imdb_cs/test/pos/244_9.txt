It must be one of the better post-Astaire musicals from Columbia. This film, produced by Arthur Schwartz and the veterinarian director Charles Vidor, placed a map on Gene Kelly and strengthened Rita Hayworth's reputation as a leading dance dance partner. She plays a bit of a double role as she performs in the 1940s with Gene and co-founder Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of her grandmother, a late night musician. The music should also be chosen because I believed in the latest project that worked on the legendary Jerome Kern (now best known for the "old man's river" and "smoke gets in the eye") and his lyricist was equally legendary Ira Gershwin. They added a score that is full of magic and characterization. Music for historical sequences is particularly remarkable because it is so perfectly stylized in the early 20th century, which was the original period of Kerns. It's like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands of the 1970s and listening to them in their original style. The story is pretty insignificant, which is fine with me because this movie is so close to zooming in as you'll ever see the golden age of the 1930s / 40s Broadway music style on film. Even the aspects of war propaganda in the 1940s movie music add to it, as the talented trio sings "make your way for tomorrow" and even humorously jokes with American enemies and uses period slang like " gremlins ‚Äù. Probably the most memorable performance in the movie is Kelly's dance to "Alter-Ego Dance", who found himself arguing and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of conscience. It predetermines much of its later work and also costs an effective and memorable scene in and of itself. Fans will want to look for it for various reasons - Kelly fans will see it as a rare chance to see him outside the boundaries of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in stunning color at the height of her fame and abilities. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and admire the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a certain gem in the crown of the Columbia music program.
