One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends "Only for big fans of major actors or fans of exotic Romance / adventures of Holywood ..." as if they were not the reason to love him! Anyone who, after seeing this film, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimility, or the realism of political motivations or other interest in the film, just doesn't love movies. Take a look at this and be amazed by the stellar power of two leading, exotic, romantic, photographic and musical adventures of a truly escape film. That's proof that Hollywood can "do" as they used to when it really wants to. Solid 8/10.
