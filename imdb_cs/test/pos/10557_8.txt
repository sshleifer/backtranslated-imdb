My Father Hero was my favorite movie when I was younger. It's about Andre, a divorced French man who wants to marry his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl) on vacation, hoping to get closer to her. She is upset and hurt that her father has never been to her and decides to give him a hard time. Her father, the whole island, will be involved and the film will turn into a funny wild movie.
