Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park, finally get out of their grueling conversation to talk to the cameras and drink champagne in the whirlpool. At first, when I watched it, I didn't feel as much sarcasm as it was in this. I knew they were joking when they complained about the various actors at the show and when Trey said he wouldn't give his mother any money, but there were so many sarcasms that this document was rather mock-up. full of internal jokes. This "document" shows all about South Park (up to the second season anyway). This shows what is happening behind the scenes with animation and recording. It has interviews, many of which are fake talks, but some, among all the fabric, give a peek into the show. Clips from both Trey Parker's Christmas Shorts as well as many good clips from the show are shown. If you were a South Park fan then it should cool your knowledge thirst at the end of 1998 when it was done. Now, of course, the show has changed, but it's still interesting. What we have here is a fun documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone look like arrogant idiots, and that's exactly what they wanted to leave. It could be so in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51-minute long smart joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** outside ****. 51 minutes. Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
