With regard to Chan movies that would follow, it's not bad. A lot of stereotypes start with the Black Man at the beginning and when a police captain orders that "every Hindu in the city" round up. The show of stereotypical characters enters the scene including Shemp Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving fast around the city, from Sutton Pl. to W. Village in Lightning. The end is stupid. Obviously, a toy plane is used that rises across the sky and then sinks into the nose. Ed Wood couldn't do it better. The last scene is absurd because the killer will obviously blame himself in his attempt to soothe one person who knows his identity. Overall, it's worth watching.
