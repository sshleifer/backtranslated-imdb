Not to hear about this movie, it came as a surprise when it was shown on the cable recently. Gary Ellis, a talented director of "Tough Luck", does screen wonders written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film includes a viewer from the beginning. Archie, a young cheater in the middle of this story, has been involved in all kinds of petty crimes. In fact, we are witnessing a confrontation right from the start, which will make it as fast as possible from New Orleans. It ends in a carnival that drives the mysterious Ike. Archie falls on Davin, the woman he should be wise to keep on. The result is a deadly judgment for Archie, which then becomes the subject of double crossing all around. The director should be awarded the Norman Reed casting, who is apparently in love with the camera. Despite his nature, one feels to him because we know his heart is in the right place. Beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as an exotic Divana dancer who, despite being a lover of Ike, lures Archie into the falling heads above her heels. Armand Assante is hardly understandable with a thick accent that speaks during the first half of the film. "Tough Luck" shows new director Gary Ellis, who shows that he will do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing.
