As far as I know, I saw most of Lucio Fulci's movies, with the exception of some of the later ones that appear on DVD, and I must say that this was his best pre-zombie offer. In fact it beats his later films by hand-down. It's a story of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town in the middle of nowhere, where young boys die mysteriously. It's not a mystery how they died, I think it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered to be a witch? Is she a young woman who lives in a luxurious modern house on the outskirts of town that has done a lot of drugs? Is it a village idiot who will soon get out of the wrong place at the wrong time? You will only know when you watch and watch as you should, because this is a mysterious thriller or I should say "giallo". I've seen it before, but it's been a long time and it was as strong as the first time when you were looking at it. For those of you who only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie swings, well, open up your mind for it because it's well worth seeing, and while "monsters" in this are people, they are as ugly as anything that has emerged in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars, see! Please....
