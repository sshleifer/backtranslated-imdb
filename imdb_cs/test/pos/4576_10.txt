I recommend Idiocration to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the movie is bright and made me laugh so hard that I had several times tears running down my face. Until the end, when I took a breath and realized how close we were to the judge's tomorrow's vision. Beware of the portrait from a Mac guy (Justin Long) as Dr. Lexus. His performance Oscar-worthy I found, especially considering what was recently released by Oscars ... besides being cute. In short, the Idiocracy is a mortally witty look at a possible future where people are named after brand names (the president's second name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, garbage mountains, because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it, and no one cares about anything but money. All because only stupid people behave. It sounds to me. Yeah, yeah; that's what I think when I see a professional match ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It is a good laugh and it will think.
