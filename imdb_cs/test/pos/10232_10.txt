Why Critics Like This Movie? I do not get it. This is perhaps my favorite effort, Clive Barker. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and lets it face, "Lord of Illusions" doesn't move at all !!! I loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Blood Book". Amazingly fun. He has a malicious side to him that is totally unlike Stephen King. He freely mixes with his own homosexuality and special religious and occult elements. I love love love love. I also realize that Barker is just as dark a fantasy writer as a horror writer. And fantasy just isn't my bag. He gives me the right to sleep. He always has. I also think Barker works best with stories. His novels tend to roam a little. That was my experience when I tried to read "The Game Of Damnation". It started well. Then I thought about 100 pages, "where is it going?" because it wasn't all. I read "Cabal" (Nightbreed's book was based on) and thought it was good. I AM RANDOMLY as Decker's character processing. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker presents it. Black and white. It is here. It gives him a simplicity that is attractive and believable. Asking why Decker is killing, he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. But in fact I liked Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail Barker gives to his films. I LOVE IT. I think it's just beautiful. Mr. Illusion also had some of that. Some of the drawings at the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It's like the entire Barker Dictionary dreamed only for the Nightbreed World. I'd be wondering how much his design was. I know he's an amazing artist who owns style and language as an artist. Nightbreed is also BArker's most entertaining movie. It moves very fast. Well adjusted. It's not like Lord of Illusions. Very fast. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little film slasher. Things with a killer at the beginning of killing a family and later torturing an old man at the store are really scary things. The mask is scary. I'd be curious if Barker suggested it. It's not just a hokey Jason or "Scream" mask. Something about it is really disturbing. Anyway, it's a great movie. Be sure to check if you haven't seen it before. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, Clive BArker is the best. But it is frightening and violent, but warn
