When "The Cure" starts, we find out about a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenage boy living with his paranoid mother and living next to him is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day Erik and Dexter join and head to the supermarket where Dexter gets his first Butterfinger flavor. When Erik learns that Dexter has AIDS, she tries to make the tea better and better. But when the front cover of the National Enquirer says the New Orleans doctor found a cure for AIDS, two boys stop at nothing to get to New Orleans for treatment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship movies ever made. This shows unconditional love between a boy, his (best) best friend and his best friend's mother. Everything is so well done, there's no need to change anything. Not only am I that 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, but it's also a sad but funny and funny AIDS movie. And the tragic final with Dexter's AIDS contract is enough to get rid of tears. Very good.
