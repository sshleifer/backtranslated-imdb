I expected it to be the same as the others, trying to be frightening ends and look stupid. Somewhere along the line, the authors had to realize it, so they made the film in a completely different direction, basically ignoring the other movies. This is a movie rather than a fourth record in the children's play. The new idea is that it is the best in this series by far.
