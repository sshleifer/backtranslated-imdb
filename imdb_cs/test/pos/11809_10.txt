*** Includes spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Nice movie played by Brad Renfro and always amazing by Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzell, of all his films I've seen so far, I loved each one for a variety of reasons, and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro is also doing very well in this film. The Cure is the drama / advent of film age from the perspective of a sick child and his friend. The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up making friends with a child next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mom is very narrow-minded, ill-informed and somewhat "fat" when it comes to Dexter's disease. She thinks AIDS is contagious as Shared Cold, so she doesn't want her son to go anywhere near Dexter. After many attempts to self-cure, boys embark on a trip to New Orleans to find a cure after reading a booklet about him. After Dexter got his kicks out of Playboy, his health goes south shortly afterwards, and as his health becomes uncomfortable, there is still enough life in the boy and Eric for two jokes of pretending to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter really dies of his illness and leaves poor Erik to wonder why he can't find a cure. In the course of the film, bonding more with Dexter's mother than his own ends. <br /> <br /> It's a very gratifying movie to watch and isn't absolutely perfect (movies are rarely), but you won't worry much more about getting involved in the movie. Necessity for Joseph Mazzell fans, one of his best performances ever. Very well-recommended must-see movie - if you can find a copy :)
