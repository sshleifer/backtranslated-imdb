Young Garfield turned into an "executive sentence" in 1939. Boxer Johnnie Bradfield, who celebrates ringing victory in a locked locker room, expresses his love for mom, rejection of booze and pure lifestyle to fans, including cops who eat it. Later in the evening, with his bimbo gal, he plowed and twitched while his manager, who was riding, shared the evening. And whiskey. The problem is evolving when another pair comes. The guy is a journalist and says he will expose Bradfield's false life on the front page. The manager kills the reporter and he and his floozy are leaving. Murder discovered, cops, later, are wary for the now somnolent boxer whose car is driven by a manager with his new girlfriend-Johnny is now ex. Police chase ends with a fire accident. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable. Johnny discovers he's supposed to be a murderer. But he is also considered dead. Seeks advice from a lawyer, instructs the counselor with a key to a bank box that keeps his only savings, $ 10,000. The lawyer later gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance is his fee for giving him professional advice: getting out of town, going fast and going far. (I would never charge the client more than $ 5,000 for such an overwhelming, concise and wise course.) \ TJohnny, now a hobo-hauling freight train, sets out for a ranch in Arizona where he is treated back Cheers Beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a great actress whose career has been on the rise. If he takes Jack Dorney for his moniker, the pugilist loses some of his rough edges as he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and friend - Dead End Kids. Famous characters on screen pre-war viewers. The chances of making money arise when the boxer shows up with a challenge for all babies to win a few rounds with him in the ring. It's a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but it's flying in the ointment. Who should show up, but New York's Detective Monty Phelan, the laughing warehouse department? He was in charge of the morgue for ages because of a mild mistake early in his career, which sent an innocent man to Old Spark (we all make mistakes, right?) Phelan recognized Bradfield from a reportage photo and he is there to watch the game and make a pinch. Claude Rains is a cop who withstood lights and spikes from his fellow officers for years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable, but it's good. I hope it was the main feature when it was released - it's too good to be thrown as a "B" second on the marquee. Busby Berkeley, best known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "They Made Me Criminal" and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's versatile score composers, wrote nice but not extraordinary music for the movie. <br /> < The film is now available on Alpha Video DVD $ 4.99 and has given me real pleasure.Look over again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
