Emanuele Crialese has done a fantastic job with one of those movies that have been in the background for your years. It was Respiro (see comments and synopsis here in IMDb). Now that he carried the beautiful young talents he had on the screen for the first time, he would take the audience to the dark emptiness. A literal leap into dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (film title). A big problem he calls it for his American release "The Golden Door". The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest - that is, their lives, for a dream. I hate to spoil the show that tells the story, so I'll stay a little at Criales' work and his whole team did it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> He first decided to stick with: direct sound as much as possible. That means the whole movie. Textures, pain, nuances of reality are always mixed with odors, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as well as in real life. Screaming bent metal and sanding wood, the infamous wind drone and the sinister sounds of big engines and boat corners are among the points that this film does. <br /> <br /> The camera is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the first shot (again almost the first shot from Respiro) and permeates the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of despair. The subdued tones and the very gray and gloomy portrayal of the people suffering from the cramped and dirty ship they sail into hope are fascinating. Light is used sparsely, almost to discover all the characters in the dark. The beauty of each shot and each scene is enhanced by period costumes and perfectly selected actors' physical features. Vincenzo Amato is definitely alone again. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always expresses to his very complex characters. Charlotte Gainsbourg is so. I think she never achieved perfection at The Cement Garden and in her first film: L'Effront√©e. Maybe it's just that she seems a bit embarrassed in her role. <br /> <br /> Places and files are tough and convincing, almost playing their character themselves. Perhaps the most notable figure is the character of Philip Pucillo, the mute of the younger son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then he played a crowded boy who was as relentless as anything around him. His character is now an expression. And just that: no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with noble power. Maybe it's one of those films that won't be well received in the states. It's absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that most of the time, the language is one of many dialects that is much older than the Italian itself. In the US, this movie may be too much for the Americans for the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they come to the States will see this film with astonishment. And again, minimalism, which goes hand in hand with Criales' ideas, is back with closing the scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to antenna. All in all, another great and very well told story of this filmmaker, who this year (2006) won 6 awards and was nominated for the Golden Lion. It's not a little deed!
