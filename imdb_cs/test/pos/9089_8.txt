This movie has a strange environment that takes place in a school that is really old to start, but it certainly doesn't look like any environment in a sterile medical school. Very Gothic and atmospheric. As for the movie itself, well, OK, the assumption is a bit appealing, but hey, that's why we're watching movies, right? And it's much less attracted than some of the garbage that these days are, that's for sure. Medical students experiment with "short-term" deaths as if they were briefly dead to experience what is the afterlife. It's pretty nice, in some cases, until parts of them come back with the cook and start interfering in their earthly lives. I haven't seen this movie for years before I got it on DVD and I have to say I forgot how good it was. And it occurred to me that Julia Roberts looks really beautiful in this movie, not as actresses today, who are said to be beautiful but dressed and made as cheap hookers. Good old times. Anyway, it's a big movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
