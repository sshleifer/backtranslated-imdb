I've seen this movie for over 25 years and it's almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It's definitely one of the most unique movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I think Martin Sheen also got "billing" in billing. She dominates the film, but receives less billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hour, 17 minute movie (theater version). How unfair is it? Sheen is fantastic here, especially his narrative, which takes place around the world. It's one of the best stories, if not the best I've ever heard in a movie. His voice is just scary when his thoughts relate to this incredible nightmare-like adventure. I never appreciated his work in this film. Another thing that hit me on the film over the years is the number of unforgettable scenes I've never forgotten, such as ... .. <br /> <br /> Sheen loses her hotel room first movie scene; Robert Duvall and a completely out-of-place surfing scene and then a subsequent attack with Wagner's dramatic classical blaring music from helicopters; Playboy Bunny Fun Soldiers; Frederic Forrest saw the tiger close up in the jungle; strange scenes on a long boat ride; hippie journalist look Dennis Hopper greets the crew in Cambodia and then bizarre character Brando. It continues and continues with strange scenes. That doesn't mean I enjoyed everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes like the one in which the ox is cut in half (can't look it anymore), the innocent family is defeated on a small boat by Sheen's young stone crew, and the crew is occasionally a little goofy. Then, there is a huge amount of profanity, driven by too many f-words. So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad stuff in this movie for just about anyone watching this One thing is for sure: it's a movie you remember!
