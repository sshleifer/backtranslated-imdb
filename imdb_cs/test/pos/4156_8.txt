A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents attacked and tortured to death a middle aged lady returns home after an afternoon of shopping. The Romanian girl who saw everything said what had happened. That is why she launched a debate on the over-intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone without distinction. I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of ​​the well-being of Italy gives these poor people? How do they consider us the land of Plenty? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO and my question was the answer. When you have just a donkey and some goats, these propaganda postcards showing the United States as a country with rivers with milk and huge vegetables make such an impression. NUOVOMONDO is a really needed movie. It balances ethereal symbolism (dairy rivers, gaze, hard and rocky mountains, Lucy / Luce's name and character) and cruel realism (a number of hopeful people on the ship, practices on Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast, going from the angel Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato, up to the bitter and smashing Aurora Quattrocchi as a mother. Was it really so hard to enter the New World?
