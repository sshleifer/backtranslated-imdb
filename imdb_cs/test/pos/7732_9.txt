Just beautiful. It's long. No climax. Don't wait for something to happen. Great for rainy day. About a middle-life man who takes his family to remote areas of the Greek islands. I saw it in my teens and I still love it 20 years later. But I couldn't find him in the video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who wants to basically go home and then settle down on the spot. There are no phones, no television, boredom, which when struck by such calmness, the human state is bored and then thinks. And every character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved in the character of John Cassavets, but he's not, well, you know. Gina Rowlands is a woman who loves him, but she's just about to give up her marriage. It is challenging and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the film, Greek, who talked to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex, but about things she is curious about. But he is irritated and horny and I did not like this character. The place of the movie is what makes this film so good. That wouldn't work if it was anywhere else. I recommend this movie and give it 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
