... the last time I laughed like that. It is the testimony of Rowan Atkinson's talent that he has created a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without barely speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but with ease. Despite the fact that the show has been running for only one season, anyone who is vaguely in touch with pop culture will recognize the social side that is struggling with the rubber, so great is the talent and effort that has been made to the show. Sometimes irritated, sometimes nice, Mr. Bean is an innocent, unhappy guy who also becomes the embodiment of evil. Brothers of this character cannot be put into words, you have to convince yourself. The show sometimes becomes too depressing, like in the infamous sketch of New Year's Eve, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going to the restaurant himself, offering a congratulatory card he signed and being served at stake . Yet there are times when you can't help but feel overwhelmed by the inventive methods that Bean gets out of trouble, like getting rid of those shares in many clever ways or turning into a swimsuit without the first pants! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you have to laugh while watching. Finally, I would like to point out that while "Bean" is classified as a children's program, it is just as fun for all adults who have a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" jokes go over the heads of the smallest and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there's something like that), it's funny no matter how old you are, "Bean" is the most accurate definition of a family show. It's just a classic and always brightens up.
