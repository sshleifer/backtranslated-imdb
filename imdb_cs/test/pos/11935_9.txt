This is one of the best "Bloke" movies from the early 90s and slightly dated, it's one of those films that would never get today, which is very special! In fact, a very similar film was made in the 1990s called "Masterminds" and it was a PG variation on the same theme, but it was nowhere near so fun or realistic for that matter. So what's so special about this movie? It is a comradre between the main characters and the theme of the film against all the onslaught of the film. Sean Astin is very sympathetic and has played in some of the most memorable films of the 80s and 90s, especially "The Goonies". He also went on bigger things with "Rudy" and "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, but "Encino Man" is a good trip down the memory track. Will Wheaton from "Stand by Me" lend nice support to the movie and Andrew Divoff is an amazing villain. Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalks in his role, but he does add some brevity to the film, particularly his relationship with Astin's rebellious character. <br /> <br /> So how's the action? According to today's standards, it is somewhat tiring and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but production values ​​are good and violence is really ugly for a film that includes school students. However, the director will supplement the limited budget with some exciting moments and well placed humor. So park your brain at the door and enjoy this kind of memorable action movie, but don't expect Oscar!
