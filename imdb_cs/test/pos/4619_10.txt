I saw this movie in the preview tonight and it was fantastic. It does well in displaying the problems that an average high school student is subjected to. I left the film overwhelmed and sad and still grateful that this film will have a chance to raise awareness of these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression) through its audience. It's a fantastic Aussie movie. <br /> <br /> Go see it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from him.
