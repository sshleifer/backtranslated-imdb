Since the fall of the introductory theme, "The Man with the Golden Shoulder" has been a classic pastime of the 1950s. No gentle here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes back to the old quarter where old flocks are still lurking. This is the story of his dark ride with all his emotional luggage intact. All performances are a bit overrated, but that's part of watching fun. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. In my humble opinion, this and the "Manchurian Candidate" are two of the largest film directors. Don't miss one of them.
