Evocatively directed and slickly photographed a psychological mysterious thriller with exceptional lead performance by sombre Donald Sutherland, and a strong supporting role from Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material has decided to keep it all and pass from investigation period to victim story. Rarely and quite annoying nature of the investigation drew me in, but when she remembered the victim's side, which showed that her last days were not so convincing, they had become a little irritated and similar. While the script is very detailed and somewhat complicated when it accompanies us, the final and surprising revelation should be more disturbed by the bone and not helped by its sloppy execution. Howard Blake's musical score has an emotional sting to his stimuli, which simply persist, and the capable director Claude Chabrola (well for most of the parts) has a strong stylistic and tight way to get the best out of the best places and flexible cast. Young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry are also doing an incredibly good job.
