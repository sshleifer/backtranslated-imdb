I'm out of words to describe the beauty of "Crane flies", but I'll try to write it anyway. It is a strong and delicate story of love that takes place in World War II. It's a classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by war and what comes between them. The films are so beautiful that you will be kidnapped - film technology is in perfect harmony with emotions. There are several scenes that depict war directly: bombing - wind, lightning, explosions - this will have important consequences in the life of the hero, Veronica, waiting for Boris to return; and there is another scene at the front where we will be confronted with an emotional / visual hurricane that shows images played in Boris's mind. The next scene works as a leitmotiv of the film and provides its name - cranes flying in the sky. This image is a symbol of nature and the seasons and underlines the film's last message: not to keep hope and fight for a better future. Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and he also touched me deeply. It's not just pure technology. Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What more can I say? The film goes beyond the time it was created - the action takes place during World War II. But it could happen anytime, anywhere. As long as the wars (both large and small) remain, the film and its message will remain relevant.
