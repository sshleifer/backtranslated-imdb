I just got back from Black Snake Moan's vision. I spent my time reading the reviews ... most seemed to be focusing on the obvious ... "skinny white girl strapped to a black man" ... I hate when "critics" miss the meaning of the film. I suppose it helps to live in Memphis ... and I lived several times in Mississippi. It can also help that I'm a former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get that movie. Pivovar's simple "payout story" is easy to follow and could have various topics to tell the story ... but I believe it's very impressive as "blues". It would be my hope that people do not read all the humbugs ... and / or various reviews ... and a really good movie is missing. Getting through different things like skinny girls in white panties ... getting past Justin Timberlake, accepting his character Ronnis (who plays very well) ... get past "Snakes on the Plane" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... how he turned into a very trustworthy Mid-South blues man. If you know a little about Mid-South culture, much of what's going on can hit some like cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer knows how to paint canvas and let the actor tell the story and this movie you like . Nobody says the end ... so watch this movie ... and yes, I agree with what the critics got right ... the music is amazing!
