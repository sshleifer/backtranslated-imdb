This story documenting the rise of the first Chinese emperor and his efforts to unite the empire was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. It's worth every penny. Visually dazzling cinematography, extensive scores and outstanding characters make this movie one of the most beautiful epics ever made on film (foreign or other). Don't miss the chance to see it on the big screen.
