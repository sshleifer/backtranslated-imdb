I remember hearing about this movie and how it played in almost every theater theater in Toronto. It is a group of girls who are not accepted by other associations at their college, so they establish their own, and of course they call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie that's just bursting with nostalgia! Lots of fully equipped T-shirts, supplies, fights and football matches like no other! It's compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie in its own right, but for me nothing is compared to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of entertainment and character. If you're looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further because H.O.T.S. The girls are on rescue, boom-boom shorts & everything!
