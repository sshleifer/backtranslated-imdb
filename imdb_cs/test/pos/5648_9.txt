An unwavering descent into psychological and physical oblivion, which will undoubtedly burn the images of true brutality and the suffering of war into the cortex as many other films will not. In fact, there is no other war movie like this. Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima's first hand only 10 days after the fall of the bomb. He said that from that day on, his mission will always be to express the nonsensical, empty violence that people put on themselves. Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... because the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soulless soldiers marching on roads that only end in death and destruction. Mr. Mr. Ichikawa manages to bring his message to the world through this terrible piece of cinema.
