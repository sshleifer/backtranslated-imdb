This is a 100% improvement over the third movie crowd and it's a hell of a good time. This is John Hughes' film that meets Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this film and it really stands out as a savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes really makes this movie shine. Actually, they're the only good parts of the movie. I was a bit bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It's as if they were thrown as a side plane and someone saved the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch, and I really liked the black humor. I thought he'd do more. If you want one hell time, be sure to check it out. <br/> 7/10.
