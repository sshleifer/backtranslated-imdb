Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a terrible car crash. She starts to live alone as an independent woman without helping her with her relatives. He has a friend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but retreats because of his future mother-in-law's behavior and the lack of trust shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And starting to make Roop feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story is about why Anand - MD's richest corporate house, AP - decided to live as a neighbor of Roop and what follows. <br /> <br /> This film has a freshness to that we rarely have. see in Indian movies to it. Although the story slows down, you feel that you are familiar with it. Kudos to Shekhar Kammula for such a wonderful direction! Brilliant music and background score composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan increases quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa gave a great performance. I think it was the best choice for this role because of its unusual appearance and amazing history. Anand, like Raja did well. I watched this movie three times and enjoyed it every time. It's a class besides the daily dose of action movies we get here. Highly recommended !!
