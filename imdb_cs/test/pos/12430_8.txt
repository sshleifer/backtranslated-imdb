This was Showtime on the night and I thought it would be another holiday that would consist of a video like "Earth vs. Spider" or any other horror movie. Instead, I found a comedy / gore classic. It was legitimately funny and surprisingly, acting was pretty good. Even my wife, the overall horror hate, agreed and laughed on the parts. In addition, FX was high quality. Overall, the film felt like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the two main characters reminded me of Shaun of the Dead. It's definitely worth watching, but don't take it seriously. The End.
