Spoilers forward. 2001: Space Odyssey is undoubtedly the most challenging and successful film of late Stanley Kubrick. This is not the movie you watch to be entertaining or amused. Instead, it gives you a banquet for reflection, images that persist in the mind's eyes long after the movie is over. It's a movie you could meditate on. The film deliberately offers more questions than it can answer, is made on composing and mystification, but still leaves the viewer with a sense of respect and respect. (which allows him to engage in the process of viewing, the enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewer) the questions he poses are big and sinister in terms of the origin and destiny of the human race, it is the ultimate place in cosmic design and existence or lack of some creative intelligence beyond the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of Four Quartets gives us a clear view of the past. We see our distant ancestors, half human half, in a state of starvation. Climate has destroyed most plant life and vegetarian animals are close to starvation. An alien object appears, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, and the animals are also inspired by their presence to create tools and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when the two tribes meet close to the water source, the tribe that developed the tool to make capacity, as well as the Belgian, healthyly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered with the first remains of technology, triumphantly casts the bone he used as a weapon in the air. We see a bone transformed into a floating satellite that contains nuclear weapons. We will soon discover that the world is torn by nuclear paranoia. The memories-inspired characteristics that once helped us survive threaten our existence. Again, humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will come to help humanity. in the next step of development. When examining the Moon, a monolith identical to the former monolith we have seen is discovered. The governments of the world, usually mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the consequences. A mission is organized. The memorial is involved in some radio communication with Jupiter. Several men travel to the transfer destination. Most of them will be kept suspended for most of the time. The spacecraft pilot will be a super HAL computer that has been programmed to mimic all features of human beings. The movie has many excellent sequences. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is excellent. The most memorable are the "Blue Danube" and "Also Speak Zarathustra" (especially appropriate to the theme of the film going beyond normal consciousness.) Cinematography is also extremely good, after one movie viewing the last 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The HAL character is central to the film's central work. It also has its negative traits when imitating all the characteristics of human beings. The paranoia it develops, which almost leads to the destruction of the mission, is a precise mirror of paranoia that has allowed the political situation on Earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the features we have to leave if we are to continue the next phase of our development. The film's architecture is also meaningful. Many spacecraft are designed to design reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, which is the central theme of the film. The end of 2001 is the most remarkable and distinctive film ever made. This film has a look at life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It represents a pattern for history and human evolution that is cyclic but progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, but with a human race that evolves according to the will of a being with a greater sense of mind. Even if we never know what it is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant to be a failure, it is a destiny beyond the ability to imagine. This still amazes me that, despite this film, many people still consider Kubrick misantrope. This is a religious film, not in the ordinary sense of adhering to any particular religion, but because of it, it is a wonder to the vast panorama of existence and it is engaging in the deepest and most important questions of purpose and truth. It might be a little too much in the hands of any other director. The Hollywood view of life is too demanding, usually involving the magnificence and intensity of such a vision. But Kubrick was a visionary, guided by absolute confidence, not only that he could handle the material of this kind, but that he was the only one who did it. He made use of all his creative resources to create this film. Writing a partnership with Arthur C Clark is the most fruitful in film history. Kubrick had to think of some of the special effects that were used in the stunning top of the movie. The resources that brought his vision to life at that time did not exist, so he brought them into existence. 2001 is an absolutely unique film experience. Those who lack it do so at the expense of their own intellectual and imaginative abilities.
