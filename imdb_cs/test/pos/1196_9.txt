I watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we should watch it. I didn't want it because it was such an old movie, how could it be good? I finally watched this friend and my father. My friend and I loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy. I think it shows, even if it's from dad, that doesn't mean it can't be a good movie. I bought a movie not long after I saw it on TV, I put it on a lot and sang along with songs. I even watched it with my classmates at my birthday party. it's a nice, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you don't try it, you can't say it's bad. Even if you don't think I'm gonna watch a movie from dad's time. Try the first part of a movie that you can always stop if you don't like it. I really recommend it, it's great!
