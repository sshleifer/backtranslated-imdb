I'd say "Bride of Chucky" is "return to size", but the series has never been great. Very good # 1 was, # 2-3 were storaways, and I think this fourth installment is equal or even better than the first movie. And contains the best subtitles / tagline: "Chucky Gets Lucky." So, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series when Jeri Ryan did for Star Star Trek: Voyager. Tilly didn't just make a presence; added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a big little sidekick / play-thing for Chucky. And just as I liked this feature, she can't get all the credits: props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror tributes), writing, inner jokes (reopening + pinhead) and Chucky lines were big ("in fact if ( this) was a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice, "among others. He merges with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers to "Bride" Dolls and a pair of Bonnie and Clyde Teens (Really, Heigl?) Get this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for all fans of Chucky, the 80s slasher-horror fans, or even for those who have never seen any of the previous 'Baby Play' movies. Is it funny, dark, harmless, bloody? but not over the top and through Tilly's literal 20 minute screen time, it's always great to see her. After all, you hardly see her playing poker. (Side note: Of course I took the "Hackensack, NJ" link to Superman)
