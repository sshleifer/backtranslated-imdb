This, without any doubt, is the biggest spin off on Jackass ever made, hell, it even blows jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Image: You have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up, throw a ton of money, and some seriously cool pieces, and you have Viva La Bam. This show, it's such a family, and it's not just a "gang" run to be a complete jerk (like in Jackass.) For example: Bam's parents, April and Phil, are in every episode, with Bam's performance The Obese Uncle, Don Vito, To Get Started The reason why the Marger family makes us laugh is simple: Someone in our family can relate April: A woman who wants to live a life by the book and follow tradition. trying to be a good father, and finally, Bam: The son who never grew up from high school. <br /> <br /> Jokes and jokes in every episode will make you laugh and purchase a DVD is definitely recommended! Another thing that is surprising Seeing is how casual Margera is over the whole thing.He said in interviews that for most episodes, he is not playing, and is just acting out of instinct. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the whole thing, however is the amount of Marger's influence over MTV Er played in his backyard, MTV did it, he wanted to meet Dani Filth for one day and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his yard, that's what happened. Add to this your passion for love-metal (and debated as emo) by HIM and his brother's band CKY, and there's plenty of banging on his head. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass, you'll fall in love with it. Last year I borrowed a friend from my friend 1 and I would give up my feet to meet Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed and I can promise you that you will be at the end of everything in the stitch!
