For those of you who are looking for crazy pieces that characterize Harold Lloyd's silent comedy, this is not a movie for you. What Cat's-Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd, who tried to push through the sound. For me, the closest movie comparison to Lloyd's character is Peter Sellers at Being There. For all the education Lloyd had taken in dealing with the world, he could also be raised in isolation, as it was Sellers. But where he was brought up, he was like a missionary child in China and I don't know how much Christianity he and his family were able to teach the Chinese, but young Harold learned the wisdom of Chinese philosopher Lin Po, whom he constantly quotes as a forty of happiness cookie. As it turned out, Lin Po was one wise dude. Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, has decided that his son needs some education in the modern world of America in the 20th century and sends him back to be the guest of a missionary pastor who sponsors the mission. Pastor is a permanent candidate for Stockport's "reform" movement. But when Lloyd arrives and the pastor dies. Now the reform movement is a fraud and pastor of the political bosses who need rivals in every choice. They decide that Lloyd might be a better patsy than the one who just died. Of course, as with these types of movies, pats do not seem to be so easy. In fact, Lloyd constantly quotes from Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan used to publish wisdom proves quite an adversary for the scammers who run Stockport. In addition, Lloyd gains the admiration of Una Merkel as a cynical dame when Jean Arthur was in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. Cat's-Paw is still a nice political satire, though she didn't base Harold Lloyd as a big comedy name, as he was in silent movies. The fine cast of the players was chosen by director Sam Taylor, who was covered by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and in fact proves that he has honest honesty.
