I'm telling you, even though it's funny how many swear words in this one I'm sure the number of profanities and swear words in it would probably count up to about 200 because of what I last heard the most swear words The South Park episode is 165 counts of words with ** t, but aside from being its so funny because it has sworn words and also pedophiles shooting themselves in the head Watching your own survival also watch out for mentioning the cartmans father and also annoying the voice of Chris Hanssseeeen and also kyle must save the cartman from the pedophiles (catch the predator show is also on the dateline) and they watch peado down and when they got there peado "shot alone"
