I watched this movie over and over and over and over again - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and that makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm so glad Kate Winslet and the other lady have rejected her part), it's just one of those roles you know no one else could compare. It's a beautiful love story for these two very different people in miserable situations that come together. He stands next to each other no matter what happens, even if it is in a strange situation and crazy ways. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you now that it's not for everyone - everyone I have shown. say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll love it and want to share it with others! 10 Stars!
