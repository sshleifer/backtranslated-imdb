Interesting twist on Vampire Yarn - fast, loud and whimsical. Despite my initial fear, Kris K carries her part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides an impressive physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide a pleasant distraction :) 110 minutes. If you like the black look of the Matrix then Blade will appeal to you, Blade even 'avoid the sequence of bullets' sequence.
