HLOTS was an excellent series whose NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS the plot is real, dialogue is real, relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, Bind all the loose ends, it was good to have all the gang back together, even a couple who died show (wont say how) The storyline was a quick pace, the emotional and full of spirit series had a week and a week. Killing, life on the streets, network drama in his BEST !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs up and everything. Thanks NBC for not getting us!
