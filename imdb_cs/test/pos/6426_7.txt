Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, finds she has a memory loss and can't remember the last few days. He begins to follow the trail of memory fragments that lead her to Garma. People in the city seem to recognize it and begin to think that the repeated astronaut nightmares who do terrible experiments have something to do with her own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting and the story is good, but it's a bit slow and arty for my taste. The plot has some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it is going. Florinda Bolkan is in a good role (but even better in "Flavia the Heretic") and it's always nice to see the "star" child actor Nocoletta Elmi. However, Klaus Kinsk√Ω's role is too small. This is not a movie for a tough gore hound or exploitative addict, but it's still a very nice hour's secret.
