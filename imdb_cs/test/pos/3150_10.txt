I saw the short title "The Reader" recently and found that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt that the two characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portrayed in this movie. Elizabeth was able to show a great scale with her blind character and left me feeling emotional. Morgan was able to sell me that he was totally committed to keeping "Sissy" or Franz protected from the grief of losing a sister who lived in Copenhagen. The great thing about the movie was a short run time and a budget of only ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rodgers was able to do a very well done movie that kept the viewer's interest. Rodgers takes a great look at the actor's ability and the transition of big camera angles to showcase his talent. I always feel that a director can make a great movie with a small budget than he can do with a much bigger one. Great work Duncan !!
