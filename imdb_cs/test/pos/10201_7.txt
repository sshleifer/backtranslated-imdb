WESTERN UNION tells the melodramatic fashion of threading telegraph lines between two points to the west. Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for Creightony. Indians and some bad white boys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of apparent fate is greatly enhanced by a premium music score and vivid color photography. Scott is a bank robber trying to fix his travels, and both Young and Young engineer take care of them to pay attention to the living Gilmore. Lots of great actors help keep the big production moving forward.
