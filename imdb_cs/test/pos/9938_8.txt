The young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first important role in the play play as Lady Macbeth, thanks to the wonders of production wonders falling in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach), who won her award, instead finds that horror is the one responsible for bringing her to this point in a cruel way. First, her boyfriend's friend, Stefano (William McNamara), stabbed her harshly with a knife as she had to watch, a rope tied to a pillar in her uncle's large mansion so that her eyes would not touch with the needles that stretched under her eyes under the eyes. When Betty allowed her to escape, she finds herself in this unfortunate position, where she found a strange gold chain on her wardrobe, which was torn to pieces by a madman after killing a line of wrinkles that escaped from the cage in the equipment room. , from a fashion designer who is first knocked on the floor by iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors (.. for closing this ugly scene, the chain falls into her throat with a killer who had to lower her throat to find it, though not specifically processing this act , Dario uses the ripping scissors sound for an optimal effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, playing cold and blank at Daria's request), who has nowhere to go, promises to catch a psycho because Betty relies on some of his remaining friends for comfort, director Mark (Ian Charleson, GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE, who would later die of AIDS, a sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson had informed him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive), who had been trying for a stage after a successful horror movie, even though he was criticized by critics. Mira (Daria Nicolodi, Darius' former squeeze), her agent and confidence. But the serial killer is quite driven, and of course there will be a showdown in the theater because Marco has added an interesting change to production using the crows he has. I think it's Dario his stupidest and nihilistic. Although he has certainly done later horror movies (eg His Masters of Horror entries and SLEEPLESS would suggest), this film really amplifies the ante in pure violence against the victims of the psychopath. His way of getting Betty to watch was undoubtedly the gag of Daria in terms of the kind of audience he liked to turn away from the horrifying parts of horror movies. I found myself rubbing my eyes every time she had to blink (... brilliantly, Dario shoots a beating from the view to get an agonizing effect from our point of view, as if we were those with Scottish taped needles holding their eyes open) . I love the way Dario shows Betty's extended eyes, frightened by what she is forced to observe because little blood tears the needles when she has no choice but to blink. Ronnie Taylor's photographic work is impeccable, such as a view of a crow being watched at the end of the theater as he searches for a killer. Or, when the camera "travels" the room in the theater after the killer wishing to see his muse from the boxing chair. Or, a succession of dreams where we are taken into Betty's memory of an event involving her mother's death by a murderer who put on the same mask and gloves as the one that causes her trauma today. The highlight, in my opinion, is peephole shooting, masterfully staged by all involved, because the camera follows a bullet that shoots the victim's eye, exploding from the back of the head, passing through the Betty phone he plans. use to call for help. We even get a crow killing the eyeball from the killer (.. to add to this cruel scene, the crow is displayed with an eyeball that rolls in its beak). The only aspect I didn't care about, often referring to naysayers of the movie, is the "ultimate" end that I personally felt was a bit unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to emphasize that Betty wasn't really like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies that in the twist is about why the killer is bothering our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes didn't bother me because I felt that those moments of bad graphic attacks needed a sharp rumble that heavy metal often provides.
