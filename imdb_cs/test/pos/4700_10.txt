"Sister Helen" is an excellent documentary about a rigid, intolerant, hideous mouth, bitter, flattened (civil) nun who runs refuge for drunks and dopers in a very neglected neighborhood in the south of the Bronx. All but one of the 21 inhabitants are drunk / addicted. Robert, the only middle class representative? had a real job, a house and even a BMW? regrets that she died before he could shut her down. Why? Robert, like six people, was on the parole. He complained that Helen had taken a huge wand over him and was constantly threatening to turn him over if she didn't. Did he say Helen led the center to compensate for the death of three men in her life? her husband and two boys. My husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack in 55. One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other died of a 15-year-old sting to death. Helen stayed with one daughter she left. run the center. The daughter was not pleased. She wanted her mom <br /> <br /> What is fascinating is how little Helen changed. Outwardly, she seems to have made a huge sea change. After seeing this riveting and distracting video several times - once with the director's story - it was clear that Helen had replaced 21 boss-dependent men to replace the three dead men. Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. However, her boss, intolerance and sharp tongue did not appear at the age of 56. Life had to be extremely difficult with her. Even Robert says he was clean despite Helen. The film opens with a derogatory act by Helena who wants to live in a shelter. Probably on the street. At other times, Mel, her "assistant", humiliates publicly for not giving up the year. Then his dirty coating rips in the air. The film is viscous with Helen threatening and humiliating people. Her signature song is "My Way". Her favorite phrase is, "I'll be honest with you." Often, people who use such phrases have proven to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants are really down and out. Only Robert has some business skills to push the broom. They all desperately need a roof over their head and Helen, because she runs the place herself, has the power to admit or banish who she likes. It has no board to answer and receive no public funding. It's her show. Helen believes in accessing the cookie to sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too. She blames substance abuse for drugs or booze, and not the core issues that drove men to drink and drugs. She is not a therapist, only the owner who dye her hair wears the habit and controls the power of tenants and stops drinking. Helen also rules over his prisoners by requiring tests on demand. Twice a major, very solid and respected long-term citizen - whom she trusted - failed in the tests. Helen was furious and evicted him. Major stood up and said the results were bad because he never did heroin. Helen made no mistake and could not consider the mistake that could be made. That was especially worrying because she knew the major for a long time. Yet she was contemplating his relationship with him, assuming she was a liar, and fully relied on the results. Major eventually found out that codeine in his cough syrup proved to be an opiate. Helen never publicly apologized, but reportedly consisted of large private individuals. Helen also had a very good reputation in her old quarter. Silence admitted to Robert that she had stayed very late one night to break someone. The man hurt her and he certainly deserved his tires to be cut. She wasn't a nice woman. So she finally decided that the only way to keep Travis (her surname) alive? because three men Travises died ??? was to start Travis Center. It was a lot for some people. They complied with Helena and in exchange received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to live. But one said he preferred prison. Addicts and drunks may not all be treated as children. Helen employed old school techniques that were discredited. But no one was forced to stay in the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience. Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is the residence of alcoholics and dopers who have to straighten their lives. <br /> <br /> To get the full experience of a sister sister, check out all the other interviews and the audio version in which two directors shared their experience with sister Helen and her guests.
