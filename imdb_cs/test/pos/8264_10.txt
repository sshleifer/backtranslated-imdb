I was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama, both parts when it originally aired on the Masterpiece Theater. I loved it, but I lost it. One day, as he passed through the old tapes, he found it again. I uploaded it to DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still love it! Leadership is excellent and my only complaint is that we wish to see more Kester! What a guy! And Prue. It is so strong and wonderful ... to live in time and age when its suffering and the way it treats itself is considered unfortunate and evil. Even her own brother tells Prue that he has doubts that someone will ever have her. * Sigh * Unfortunately my copy is not the biggest, with wear over the years, and I would also absolutely like to get it on a professional DVD if it ever happens.
