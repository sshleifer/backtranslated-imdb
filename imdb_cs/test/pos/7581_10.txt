Anderson's animation easily rivals that Pixar and goes far beyond anything I've ever seen Disney do. While some say the story is too abstract, I regard it as a provocative and refreshing change from exaggerated characters and humiliating animals that are usually found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left a safe home and left alone on a lonely, frightening place is easily identified with this abandoned microbe. Excellent work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
