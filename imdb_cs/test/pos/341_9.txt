In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the liberation tigers Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has estimated an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. that, as a result of the war, more than a million people were displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families in conflict is sensitively dramatized by respected director Tamil Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film Peck on the Cheek, which won several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While civil war is the mere backdrop to the discovery of a young girl, the human cost of war is clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context and points the finger at global arms dealers as a source of wrongdoing. The beautifully photographed Ravi K Chandran cameraman in southern India in Sri Lanka's terrain reflects a moving story about an adopted nine-year-old who decides to find her true mother in the midst of fighting in Sri Lanka. He played with deep feel and expressiveness from P.S. Keerthana in an unforgettable performance, Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in red across the camp. In a loving flashback, we see Amud's adoptive parents, Thiru's father (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and Indra's mother (Simran), a TV personality, to marry to facilitate their adoption by a darker girl. Young Amudha has no idea she is adopted until she comes across her on her ninth birthday, according to her parents' previous agreement. While playing, Thiru tells her almost in fact that "you're not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. He asks who is her father, her mother's name, why she took her, and so on, but few answers are ready. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, now a Tamil separatist. Immersion of the family in the reality of civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, which are mostly mastered by Ratnam's skills, even though the family's crossfire is amateurish. The peck on the face is of course a Bollywood movie and that means tons of music and melodrama. Melodrama didn't get in the way because of the strong performances of leading actors; however, I found a musical dramatization of the songs by A.R. Rahman against the film's mood with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music style video. The convincing nature of the story and the sincerity in which it is said goes beyond the limitations of the film. Tamil Cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich√© and commercial, yet Peck on the face is both a fun movie and one that deals with serious problems. The fact that it successfully overcomes the boundary between art and business is not a refusal but a tribute.
