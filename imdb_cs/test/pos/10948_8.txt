As a very expensive episode, Buffy dotted with a lot of humor. Lots of wire and kung fu stunt. The effect of twins takes place on the list of classic films. Vampires have a great blend of gloomy spirit and handsome European style. If you get the opportunity to see this in a theater it is worth a 30 minute drive, otherwise buy an import DVD before someone screwing it up by making it a bad oak.
