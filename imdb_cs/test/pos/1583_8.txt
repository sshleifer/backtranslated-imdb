I recently saw episodes 1-4 and now I can't wait to get 5 & 6 available! (I hear they're coming soon.) The Command Log seems to be a cult hit between the university crowd and all the others who want a quirky comedy. Obviously, the budget was small, but the care of the scenario creation is obvious. In fact, the simplicity of the show has allowed me to appreciate writing and acting more. Bowlsby is a put-down champion ... I just wish I could remember all the best for later use on unsuspecting co-workers! Let's say that if you don't like the command diary, I'll personally make sure your underwear brings more starch!
