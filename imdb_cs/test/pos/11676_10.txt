First of all, I reviewed this document because I was interested in the topic he was portraying about LA punks. I listened to the music and I loved the music, and I read a lot of the little zines that were made in the early 1980s and which were not so easy to reach in Finland. So if you don't like this kind of music, why do you write about it? I like this kind of music, talking to my soul, so I know that punk from all over Europe and America, so why do you who find this music "nasty" to comment? <br /> <br />
