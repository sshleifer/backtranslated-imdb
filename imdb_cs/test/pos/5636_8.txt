For me, the best and most memorable movies are often the ones I don't know about the first observation. American film is a perfect example of such a jewel. Later in the evening, I watched TV, and I noticed the only good overview between the wreckage - fortunately, I settled in real treatment. American film is a documentary film that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (in my opinion, the "orchard"), a highly articular and charismatic Wisconson boy who tries to write, manage and produce "MidWestern", a brave, low budget horror movie. who has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man full of contrast. His look is a classic stereotype with a trailer - a lean, bearded mustache, heavy metal styling of the 80s, a mullet hairstyle, etc. But to the camera, Mark reveals a surprising joke and glance when philosophizing life, love, movies and movies. American way. Unfortunately, as the film unfolds, it is clear that Mark's lack of discipline and heavy drinking tirelessly sabotages his creative efforts. American Movie is a charming watch filled with cheerful moments and vivid characters. The main one is Mark's dear friend Mike Schank, a soft spoken reformed stoner who is now dependent on soda pop after conquering the scratch cards. I totally loved American film. It creates real empathy between the viewer and the main characters, and provides merriment without feeling exploitative. I recommend it to anyone.
