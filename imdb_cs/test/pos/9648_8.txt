It's not like a historical movie, it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories, it's not a movie with a grandiose scenario, but I can definitely say it's a great atmosphere movie ... a rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor Paris apartment, each doing art, dreaming of changing the world, doing drugs and making love in its own way. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of patience to watch, and a special mood that if you're not in, you can find it very boring and boring. I liked the very realistic approach of events that happened and their immediate effect on student lives: fear for their future, the difficulty of earning a living, the obstacles to following their dreams. <br /> <br /> What I absolutely loved was a black and white picture. Camera angles were amazing, they were like freezing moments. It left me with the impression of a long presentation of an old and very emotional and suggestive photo. Actually, I had to see the film again, just to do the amazing screenshots. <br /> <br /> In a word: beautiful ...
