I thought this movie was very underestimated. It seems a little weird, and I was put off first, but once I watched the movie, it didn't seem weird at all. I was impressed by all the different possibilities the story offered, and I couldn't wait to find out how it would end. It ended once ... I thought about it for a long time. I was satisfied with everything about K-Pax, from acting and story to science and psychological issues to the end. It's not a particularly positive or happy movie, even if you giggle from time to time, but I find it particularly fun and provocative. Now I own it and I intend to follow it many times.
