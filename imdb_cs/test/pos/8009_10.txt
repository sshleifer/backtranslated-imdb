I like the whole house and the same step by step. I don't have a favorite episode, just like some scenes. But some scenes I don't like, but I haft to say why I started watching this show because it had Suzanne Summers in it. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen could sometimes be a snob, but she was also good. I just enjoyed watching a family show instead of a basket that has a lot of drugs and violence. This show is a lot like other family shows where one of the parents is always strict about curfew and data. other than step by step, my other favorite shows are full house, sabrina teen witch, gomer pyle nimc, andy griffith show and dukes hazzard.
