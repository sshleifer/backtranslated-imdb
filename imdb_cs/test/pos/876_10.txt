I love this movie. It's the first movie Master P ever made. It is based on the story of his life. It's a low budget, but it's very good. This shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans. Not only did Master P start in this film, he was also a writer and director for Moon Jones. The DVD also has a No Limit ice cream party on it. This film shows how Master P goes from bad to good and how he had to deal with things around him. It also has many of No Limit Records list in this movie. You should buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie you want to watch, it's like rap, or it's a Master P fan. Go this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.
