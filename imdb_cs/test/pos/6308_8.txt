I saw it in a week that opened four years ago, and I really didn't know what to expect that I didn't care about Sorrentino's work at the time. He created a very interesting and eventually moving account of a particular character, which for which the phrase 'life is for living' no longer applies. I was surprised at every turn, and the story always surprised me. I really enjoyed it and the way I gradually got pieces to see what was going on. Tony Servillo is excellent, just like Magnani. It opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and ends with a very moving image that takes the film into a noble territory. I have been thinking for a long time about the main character and the position he was in, and about his last fate, and I didn't shake it for weeks. I recently bought a movie and the last scene where I think she's always got me about my friend. I can't talk to anyone who has seen it yet. It is a pity that she did not reach a wider audience, as if it were the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
