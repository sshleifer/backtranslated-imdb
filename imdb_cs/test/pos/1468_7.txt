This British documentary has recently been featured on Comedy Central during their "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on DVD South Park in the second season. I remember seeing many DVDs that contain clips of this documentary, most of which take place with Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and some other guy in the hot tub. It was funny when I saw it in commercials, but I was used to seeing it when I saw a real documentary. Overall, "Goin 'Down to South Park" is a pretty funny and interesting look at how the South Park episodes and the history of the series are created when Matt and Trey came up with a college idea. However, there was something about the tone of this document that actually felt somewhat depressed. It's not as fast, fast-fired, and as lively as the South Park episodes. Instead, it's a little slow, dry wit style that at times can be funny, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you have a chance to watch it, go for it by all means, but I don't think you really miss it if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10
