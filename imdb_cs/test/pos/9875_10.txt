Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is a great movie. A thrilling, fun, creative and smart land I love. Many hate the "Thorn" concept, I love it. I think it gives the Halloween series some conspiracy. Marianne Hagan is a beautiful actress and she performs excellently, especially for her first film, and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also great. My only complaint is, why wasn't Danielle Harris in this movie like Jamie? She wanted to go back, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I like Danielle Harris. Still, I like Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think the Shape mask looks best in this movie and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly scary and thrilling, Halloween 6 rules! I love this very violent but extremely enjoyable movie. Halloween Horror Series - by far the best in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
