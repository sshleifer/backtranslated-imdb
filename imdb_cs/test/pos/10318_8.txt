Three Stooges short, this featuring Shemp. Of all the ones I've seen, I've seen it's my favorite performance in short Stooges. The basic plot is that Shemp must marry at six o'clock when he succeeds in inheriting half a million dollars of a wealthy uncle who left him in his will. So, Shemp sets out to make a bride, but finds out that it is a stronger way than expected, that is, until she realizes her heritage money. The best pieces here include Shemp shaving, Shemp and Moe in the phone booth and Larry's piano as accompaniment to Shemp voice training. Also, the sequence in which Shemp is mistaken as the cousin of Basil and his result seems cheerful.
