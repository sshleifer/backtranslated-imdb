I think this film is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is cheerful and the chemistry between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There's no boring moment in the movie and Debbie looks like always. The story is about Maggie showgirl (Debbie Reynolds) who meets penniless soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). He treats him immediately, but after he accidentally tears his clothes, he returns it on condition that he goes on a date with him. In the end, they get married at night when they have a date of one kiss. Joe and Maggie moved to Spain and found that they had nothing to do with physical attraction, so Maggie proposes to live for a month, but not as a man and a woman, which means Joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with Maggie, Joe's frustration. .Wonderful plot and wonderful movie. Do not miss.
