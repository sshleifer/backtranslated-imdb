* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie when it was released on video when I was about 8 years old. Now I'm 17 and I'm still watching it whenever I have a chance. "Aristocats" was a cute heart warming movie that I immediately fell in love with. I loved songs on it, especially those that kittens sing to the piano. In fact, I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend because I loved her so much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cats I've ever seen. Ally's cat had a big voice! My favorite part of the movie is when kittens play the piano. That part is lovely. I also enjoy their journey home. That's unbelievable. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
