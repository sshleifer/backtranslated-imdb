My friend and I went to watch The Guardian. At first I didn't want to watch, but I loved the movie - it was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. What they do and I think they should really be more appreciated. Not only did he teach it, but it was a really good movie. The film shows what they really do and how hard work is. I think the USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around. I'd suggest this movie to anyone who sees it. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The story was great, I give him 2 inches up. I cried it was very emotional if I could!
