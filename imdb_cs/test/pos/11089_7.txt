Director John Schlesinger is a tense and frantic film telling the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold the United States government secret to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competent. He is a young man very disillusioned with the imperfect activities of the CIA in Allied Australia. Sean Penn, like doping-ups, drugs run by Andrew Daulton Lee, is excellent. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger's competent and professional management, along with some very good acting, make the "Falcon and Snowman" spy thriller not to be missed.
