I consider Saboteur to be Hitchcock's first "American" movie because the story takes place entirely in the US. <br /> <br /> There are amazing scenes in this movie. Statue of Liberty Scene, Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge, water fall scenes are amazing. It's not Hitchcock's fault he didn't get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for starring roles in foreign correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. Another reason Hitchcock didn't get big stars was that he wasn't one of the best directors. Although Rebecca was a huge success, still the most success of the film went to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick got the best Oscar picture for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get the best Oscar director for Rebecca. After a foreign correspondent (1940), Hitchcock began to pay attention. But Universal gave him a low budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this movie because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low pay. He worked with Hitchcock in a foreign correspondent (1940). But he wasn't available. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings a "competent artist". I thought he did the best. He was a lesser-known actor who was willing to play a role when many great actors refused to play a major male role. As for the leading female role, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the lead role. They didn't even care. So Universal decided to give Priscilla Lane the role. I read in the book that it was one of her favorite movies. I also liked the scene in Blind Man's house. That's my favorite scene. If we listen closer to the dialogue in the scenes taking place in Uncle Philip's house, we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) studied the character of Barry Kane as he entered his house. When Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through conversation, he realized that Barry Kane was not a criminal at all. We also see his ability to hear through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car saying, "Is this a car coming?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars I think." Uncle Philip was right. On the next scene we see 2 cars. Priscilla Lane did her job. She wasn't a big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene at Uncle Philip's house is the scene where Priscilla Lane asks (Patricia Martin) "Are you scared, Pat? I thought Otto Krueger was a great villain. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey to be a criminal. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role as President in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." I want to mention this movie more. But I think my post is too long. Every Hitchcock film is a strange way in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock likes this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
