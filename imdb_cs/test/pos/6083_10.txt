I watched this movie when it was released and was really young and not too much to the movies, it was one of the most interesting movie experiences I've ever had, and in fact left me a clue. Probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the film presents them to the viewer. Years I was watching for the first time, I managed to watch it again and that was the time when I fell in love with the "English Patient" so deeply touched me and became the best film ever did. Anthony Minghella has made an absolutely stunning movie, all the places are amazing, and thanks to his camera, he can create incredible emotions in you. Of course, the music of the film is so much of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film wouldn't be the same without it. But personally the best was the delicate performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in th's masterpiece. He plays so well that a man who falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton opens his heart and delves into this forbidden matter. where Katherine hurts Almasy towards the swimmers' cave and wears a thimble to buy it. She says, "I've always worn her. I have always loved you "and at that moment he begins to cry with such pain that flows from within. Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and she really deserves an Oscar she won. Overall, this is a movie that anyone who claims to be a cinema lover should watch in his life.
