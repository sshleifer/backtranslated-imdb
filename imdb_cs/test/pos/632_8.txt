I don't know how this movie hasn't been seen for so long. I saw this movie on TV, I went through channels and came across this unexpectedly made movie. I missed the first one, about 10 minutes, but it doesn't matter .. this movie literally grabbed me, it's a real spine cooler. <br /> <br /> The absence of well-known actors in the film contributes to the effect, and you don't know what to expect from actors because they're new. U never knows when they will be killed or what they have. so it's all the more tense. Although there are many new faces, their performances were top class. The creators play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to imagine the rest. Shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also well earned by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The well-written situation of n twists, fast camera movements, neat adjustments and great direction make it a thrilling thriller thriller. In fact, this film passes between genres - horror and a thrilling thriller that leaves the viewer helpless and tense. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. Even during commercial breaks, I couldn't even move from television. I was helpless MUTE WITNESS for this excellent movie.
