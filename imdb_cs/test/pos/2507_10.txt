I am a big scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player and former boxer and I like this movie. It's not "Mystic River". It's a piece of fluff. However, there is room for fluff in life, and when this fluff is captivated, attractive, sympathetic people, cleverly drawn and full of good dialogue behave well, there is even more room. <br /> <br /> I is not Tom Selleck's biggest fan. But he's good at it. So are Julianne Nicholson (I love her bare head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (Do It!). The scenery is nice, the mood is positive, there is Torment and stupidity and farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Any (male) reviewer who turns off this movie is, say, totally confident in his masculinity. Meanwhile, I will continue to hunt pieces and pieces without excuse whenever they appear on the cable.
