I was 19 when I saw the first movie in the theater. I have a living memory of another end. It's not completely different, but significantly. I watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I think the following can't be called a spoiler because it never happened. The end I remember that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found it quite easily and, after confronting him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down to the camera. Only his face was in the frame and it was obvious he had left it, though against his will. But nothing like that in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 when she made this movie, Michael Burns was 22. In the film, she complains to her sister that Frances is doing too much sex trade. Yeah? Well, go to bed with your guy and get him. WTF?
