Like most others, I thought it was another crocodile film. So far we have had Primeval and Rogue for the last 12 months, what can they do, is it new? Where both films concerned action and violence, it's about fear and tension. so much as torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe crocodiles really behave like this, as others have stressed, but the fear is so effective that it's a stretch to tell you to enjoy this movie. It will make you feel uncomfortable as the Passion of Christ.
