I've seen this movie so long ago, but in my mind it's the saddest movie ever. I cried without a break. My mother will never watch this movie again because she looks almost painful. By the way, the story is not completely complicated ... Ann Margaret dies and has to give away to his 10 (?) Children. As if it was not bad enough, it is during depression and she must divide close siblings one by one. I think it was very sad for me, because I am also a very close knit family and I could identify with my mother and siblings with every child. I may be a masochist, but I'd like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is slightly happy (so we could at least smile and sob at the same time). It should come sometime on TV to see it again.
