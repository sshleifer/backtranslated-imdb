I watched this movie for the first time in my area and it was clear that most people didn't get the movie. Although not, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some imperfect people in a deserted southern city and actually speaks to the roots of the blues. If you don't know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no ... it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is very convincing in her role, just like Samuel L Jackson. I think it's his best performance from his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best, including that range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is tough, with some vibrant performances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr as Reverend RL. South City, along with his film genius, in my opinion.
