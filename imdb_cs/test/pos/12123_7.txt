I don't know if it's fair to reconsider. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I have never understood that the film industry is making heroes out of the crowd and cold-blooded killers. When the Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but for decades they had created a series of well-played crowd movies with major stars and directors. Of course, this is a low budget, but it's definitely good. At some point I feel like I want to take a shower. If such characters really exist, it is hard for the soul. I have always intellectualized that humanity will rise above this sort of thing. This kind of crud must be stopped. I hope people who go to movies like this are more voyeuric and less representative. I feel just like the slasher movies. Why are we fascinated by death and disintegration? In justice, I judge acting and directing, and what it is, looks like it works pretty well.
