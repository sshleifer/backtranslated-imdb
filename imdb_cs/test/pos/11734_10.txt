I wrote the above profile when I used OldWereWolf56, which is still my email address. I still believe that Fryky Andy Devine's character is the best Twilight Zone episode and I watch this episode at least once a year because I consider Frisby a lucky man because he has many friends who love him. If many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61 years old, Andy Devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 1950s. There were three assistants: a violin-based midnight cat, a Squeaky mouse who played the organ and a devil's toad named Froggy, who could appear and disappear, will bother many Andy's funny guests like Billy Gilbert.
