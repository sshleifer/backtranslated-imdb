The film begins with three people playing at the ear holiday, who decide to first visit the crocodile farm and then go for a little lighter activity, "fishing" tour. You pick up some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and add information just enough to increase tensions later in the movie, as you remember earlier. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie is well timed and not done. Tension is built through "what if", "unknown" and sometimes intestinal choices that make characters in the movie. I was wondering how I want to, if I were in the same boat, no pun. The quality of the movie was really good and the effects where they were realistic, credible and not over the top or caricature looking and out of place, the way you ever get to CGI. As a horror movie enthusiast, I watch every horror movie I get in every genre, and that's one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best I have. You see. Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
