This highly anticipated DVD memento from Rush's visit to South America in 2002 is perhaps the finest rock video ever set on the disc. Image and sound production values ​​are amazing, all the more because they continually struggle with elements to turn off that production. All the songs you would expect from the RUSH catalog are here from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, which is perfectly reproduced for the sincere, orgiastic Brazilian crowd. They actually singalong to YYZ-which is instrumental, and give you a sign of their zeal! the disc is a concert and the second disc contains 3 multi-angle set-pieces -la Villa Strangiato, YYZ and an amazing drum solo, plus a 30-minute documentary about band visits in Brazil. All this is a triumph and all serious rock fans should have a copy.
