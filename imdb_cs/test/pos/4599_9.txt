Shame on Fox for firing this movie. It was quite a rebellion and I just hope to find a second life on DVD and cable. This is a cheerful satire. It takes a "what if" situation to the extreme, and it doesn't pull any punches (or kicks into the groin). Thinking that ... what happens to this empire as soon as we get completely lazy and stupid? Everyone gets hit in this esp. a number of large corporations, and even Fox News, are punching (which is probably why the film never had a proper release - other than the marketing department that thought about the campaign and didn't know how to market it), so we just give up Some they may find a sophomoric film, due to tanning, and farting, but the film is much more than that. Either you get what Mike Judge says or not. Most of the negative reviews I read seem to come from people who just don't do it or are film snobs. <br /> <br /> Probably will play in selected markets for one week, so if you miss it, watch out for DVD, it will be worth renting and I will eventually have in my collection. Good job Mike Judge, it's a shame you got to, but I did laugh out loud and look forward to the next movie you're doing.
