I was actually a 13-year-old camp near the McCloud River, near Shasta, when the film was filmed. My family was paid to leave our camp for the afternoon when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia ... the scene where they pulled him out was actually where he started swimming down the river. And if the stuntman missed the netting, there was about 20 feet of waterfall about 1/4 mile away. It wasn't until a few years later when I saw the movie and I actually understood it. It's a pretty strong movie and definitely a great job of Jan at such a young age. His film career never came out as expected, but of course later he found success on television. I wish this movie was available because I'd like to see it again.
