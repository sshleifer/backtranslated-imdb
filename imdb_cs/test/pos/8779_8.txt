I really enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was the first conspiracy attempt he later made in his career. Probably the most amazing thing about it is how the main characters are without a face. After watching, Murray Alper recalls as a truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's moving move as a blind patriot, an unforgettable traveling Freak Show and, of course, Otto Kruger as a great and sophisticated villain, all of whom overshadowed Bob Cummings. a somewhat wooden refugee (compare that jump bridge to Harrison Ford's similar bit in Andrew Davis "fugitive") and Priscilla Lane whose heart change and subsequent love for Cummings is never quite believable. Of course, the support player is Hitchcock himself, who closes the film with two extraordinary pieces. Many people criticize older movies for lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with a lack of technology, even an attempt to express what the director wants to show, it's a great success. This film seems to have an anti-fascist message that originated in World War II, but being Hitchcock is never the most important thing, and the emphasis is always on action. It is worth checking, especially for support roles.
