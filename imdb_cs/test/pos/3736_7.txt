Despite the fact that aspects of this film appeared that I felt were not sufficiently developed, I liked it and recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of broken marriages when they meet. They are also seeking healing. They unexpectedly find that they can treat each other. There were aspects of the movie that I wished to see play more - where simple flashes only suggested themes that my mind had to fill in blanks, such as an apology for a surviving widow, and how Adrienne was feeling guilty of sleeping with Paul, to be with him soon. The opportunity for a huge love scene was lost when it was only hinted that they would make love to the hurricane. In the end, however, the film left me deeply grateful for the relationship we share with my wife. And there were times that moved me to the brink of tears. So I have to say it's worth seeing.
