This movie, I would say, was absolutely great. I see how many people think it's just a shocking movie. This is not entirely untrue, but it is just like the shocking fiction of Chuck Palahniuk's books. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata, is a kind of cruelly made film that you can almost react to. It's scary, funny, stupid, rough, full of off-the-top material and for some people exciting. I saw this fist, it was with my friend, and his mother brought him home to see him. He said it was just a Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more. It's wrong, yes, but it has some kind of eye-catching to be beautiful. As the director says, it's a shocking movie made for some reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave the audience soft, then the whole human race will be soft. I think it's a good philosophy, and I agree with it a hundred percent. Bijo no Harawata is a type of film that gang gangs out of fitness, yogurt, and everything new.
