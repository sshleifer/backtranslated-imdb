Eisenstein's first sound film tells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated Livonian knights, who eagerly brought Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Teutonic Knights, with their sinister (and somewhat wacky) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. Knights' butcher shop at the entrance to the Russian city appears to be a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with a sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. By the end of the 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimenting and make films that would be more populist and tasty to the Russian public. It stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he returned with his more affordable film. Nevsky's strength is in his second half, which represents the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in film history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so alive on the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev's beautiful, haunted soundtrack (the use of a composer to make a film was unusual at that time). One of his weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton Russian warriors trying to marry a beautiful Russian peasant) is really unpleasant.
