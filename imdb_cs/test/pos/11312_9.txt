This movie was a rebellion, it pokes fun "Madonna - Truth or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I like Julie Brown. How could I ask for more .. Julie's spoof "Vogue", called "Vague", was hysterical .. "Kelly LeBrock thinks he's great, it's just cold boogers on paper board". "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Spam Personality" !! I could die! And wait until you see what he can do with melon!
