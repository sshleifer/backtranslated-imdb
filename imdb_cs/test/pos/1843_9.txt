especially because I can rely on romantic comedy movies I have ever admired. (I can recall some horrible movies that used this story - I think it was LMN's movie with Jane Seymour) This movie is a goalkeeper. Duchovny is nice and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog lacks his deceased wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is a fun scene where he is on a blind date and the driver is a waitress. His date is terrible, and he finds himself fascinated by Minnie Driver. Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles, as a curmudgeonly grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (that's the only movie I liked him) round off the comedy aspect of the movie. It's a good movie because the story works, it's not very romantic, and it doesn't interfere with the audience's insults. 9/10 is strongly recommended.
