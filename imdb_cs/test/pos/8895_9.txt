For those who enjoyed Asterix books and movies, you'll love this movie! Yes, I admit that it blends some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and it's not just the people who show off their CGI left, right, and middle. I've seen it several times and laughed at his socks. Of course it includes the main characters Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix) and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time they have someone new ... to deal with. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Gauls will go on and on and on. Bless.
