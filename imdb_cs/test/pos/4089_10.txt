Why take a perfectly original original drama based on a perfectly good novel and transform it as a quasi-musical? And with actors exclusively missing in singing or dancing talent? Somewhat similar to "Showgirls" or two of the most recent "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget about Sir John Gielgud, who in his clothes Dali Lhama smiled unhappily, supervised the dance of the Republican party ("Family")? how to hop from one rock to another ("every little thing you do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, embodying the power of the American education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can't wait for the release of the DVD, as Liv Ullmann will hopefully include comments that will finally explain what she thought when she agreed to do this movie!
