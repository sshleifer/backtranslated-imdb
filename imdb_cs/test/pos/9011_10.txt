It's not as good as the movie that said it was a cute baby show. Okay, so the emperor has a slide back and becomes a selfish, rotten brat, accepts it and enjoys cartoons as something fun. It has a lot of jokes for parents and still keeps children 's attention. He also boasts two of the original film actors. Country Kitt, who has been in many movies, but I'm sure many people know him as Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I misspelled), which also appeared in many movies and TV series, but is best known as The Tick. It's a really rare and beautiful combination. If for any other reason I highly recommend comic book fans to watch at least one episode to enjoy a dynamic duo. To sum up, a fun kids show, with lots of inner adult jokes to laugh with them. If your interest in educational value is not your show. If you're just looking for something fun, it's a great Saturday morning selection!
