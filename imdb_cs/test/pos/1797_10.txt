I remember seeing this movie when it was released, and I still remember the buzz I felt when I left the cinema. Everything about this movie is amazing! The music is excellent and after all these years I still play the soundtrack. I've seen this movie so many times and still want to watch it over and over again. Nicholas Cage was great and whenever I saw Cameron Dye in anything today, I always connected him with this movie. It's too bad that the rest of the cast didn't go for bigger things, but maybe it's part of this movie's magic. I'm not going to criticize the film school because I'm sure all analysts can find a mistake if they want to, but what I say is that this film defined my teen years and still affects my life more than 20 years later. The film 'feels' great and evokes emotions when you look at it (well ... did it for me) and I can't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it before. <br /> <br /> 'get' a movie or you don't! Those of you who keep it will be rewarded with a unique film experience.
