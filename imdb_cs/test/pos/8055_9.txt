"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal, stubborn documentary about what was once called the "prettiest city in America". The film documents the events that led to the murder of Phenix City by the criminal syndicate Albert Patterson, Alabama's lawyer, who made an offer to the Attorney General's Attorney as a way to clean up vice and corruption to plague his hometown. His son, John Patterson, picked up his father's cloak after his death and won the post, clearing Phenix City as the primary item on his program. Director Phil Karlson has created a film that has the ability to shock even today. Grimness is so relentless that the film is actually hard to watch. We see that the crime syndicate has beaten and killed to get what they want - beating and killing includes women and children, and one scene that turns around the death of a little black girl is particularly worrying. It's not just a pleasant movie, because there are very few rewards in the end that reward the viewer for sitting in the angry events that lead to him, but it's a well-made film full of intense and angry energy. The 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with real Phenix City residents, some of them being portrayed by actors in the fictional part of the movie. The film lends itself to the quality of urgency that translates into narration, so we feel that we are watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that Karlson has helped choose a film in real places. I'm glad I saw this movie, but it's one of those movies that fill you with a sense of righteous indignation and then you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Level: A
