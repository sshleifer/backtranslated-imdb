This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the slogan is misleading and the costumes and tone of the movie are misleading. The film is pretty bloody, well done and beautifully shot. Special effects are top-notch and seem premature until you realize that this movie was released in 1979, not in 1963, as a tone would suggest. It's a unique view of Dr. Moreau and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes is the highlight and most shocking, but the film never breaks down. Certainly worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costumes / horror classics and gore-fests.
