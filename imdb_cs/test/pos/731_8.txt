As a late patron of burial thearers (1970-1980), there are many movies that I have seen and forgotten. I could never forget this. Despite his low-budget, exploitative style of filmmaking, STORY was very well done. A unique healing asylum where patients act according to their fantasies to help cure their phraseosis, random assassination of the chief physician, as well as a new nurse coming to the scene, assumed a (presumed) medical assistant, various crazy paitents, revelation that the assistant is actually a patient herself and finally saving a young sister with a simple-minded Sam who killed everyone else in the house to escape the unharmed, ready for a big STORY, holding the film together. I stressed the word STORY because it's a good movie. No matter how much blood, gore, nudity, sexual matter, or outrageous behavior you've put in the movie, if the story isn't good, then the movie isn't good. Movie credits show clips of all actors, including an old hag with the last line that tells you to get out and never come back, which is a great end to this movie. If it's on video / DVD, check it out and enjoy it.
