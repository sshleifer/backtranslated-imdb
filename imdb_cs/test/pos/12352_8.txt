Pistol-Packing Pam Grier takes names and kicks ass as a heroine in "Asylum Satan" director William Girdler's fun blaxploitation actioneer "Sheba Baby," co-starring D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of several hard pups Grier discovered during the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler co-wrote that thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer David Shelton on one night and it features a stubborn female sham who refuses to rely on a man to help her care for business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as blaxploitation movies that Grier supervised by director Jack Hill. Hill helmed African-American North Carolina native in "Coffy," "Foxy Brown," "Big Bird Cage," and "Big Doll House." * Everyone who analyzes the images of African-American women in a movie should be familiar with these epics. . The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many comfortable breaks. Secondary villains are naturally happy clowns who couldn't hit the side of a barn howitzer. Dick Merrifield, as the main adversary, qualifies as an egotistical as well as smarmly villain with selected lines like: "Anything worth stealing." In addition, composer Monk Huggins provides a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason, who moves with her, is "Good Man Is Gone". The "Sheba Child" man Grier as the Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne stylist. She leaves Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky to help her father. When he comes to Louisville, Sheba learns that her father, Andy ("Detroit 9000" from Rudy Challenger), has problems with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (Cigar-chomping D'Urville Martin "Hammer"), who demands that Andy sell his loan to Pilot or die. Initially, the pilot sends a goon team to Andy's garbage, but our hero is caught by the law. She turns Shebin's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the battle scene, Girdler rarely shows fists breaking meat. Earlier, Andy's true man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), sent Shebu a telegram asking him to return to Louisville, but didn't immediately get her thanks to his lazy partner who didn't know where to find her. Brick and Sheba join, reviving their romantic flames and sharing the night in the sack. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to stay calm in the face of adversity. As former Louisville, Kentucky, a police woman, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask the other. After arriving home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes by throwing it into bits. When she got out of the door to get into her father's car, Andy gets another piloting call. Previously, Andy refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to talk to Hoodlum. Pleased The pilot warns Andy of the dynamite that was connected to his ignition with a delayed fuse. In other words, starting a car doesn't trigger an explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheb before the car explodes. Sheba agreed to let her father handle his problems without intervention. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a male job, but I'm not gonna sit on the sidelines just because I'm a woman," Sheba told him. After her almost death experience, Sheba promises to find out who's the father's father. She grids the old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to get the information. Only after Sheba has grounded the man's face into a chlorine dust bucket will he live and tell her about the payout at the city's railway museum. Brick accompanies Shebu and filming follows with the flustered Pilot getting away through the skin of his chin. Later, Pilot sends a quintet out-of-town contracted criminals armed-to-teeth to garbage Andy's office. These shooting ranges ignore their orders without killing. Not only does he shoot the credit company's office for ribbons, but Shebu also shakes his father with a shotgun. Sheba retaliates in short order. She pulled down the nickel-plated revolver and shot down three of the four Dirty Harry-style invaders. The last hit-man discards his weapon and asks for mercy. Sheba has a finger on the trigger when killer detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of "Abby") and a single cop arrive on the scene. Andy Shayne dies at the hospital and holds her daughter's hand. The pilot is naturally angry at this revelation and his fury borders on the apoplexy. Then Sheba watches the shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of "Cleopatra Jones"), and reports him on the pilot while holding him on a rifle in a car wash. This is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots from the washing machine that whirled and roared. Walker warns the pilot of Sheba. The pilot and his followers confront Sheba in the parking lot and swap lead. Sheba flees on foot to the nearby carnival. While the police corner is one of the pilot's men, he acts with the others. The pilot shoots one of his own coincidences and Sheba drops it down. Pilot Pilot sets off on the runway and threatens to keep him there until the roller coaster cuts his head. The pilot manages to escape after spilling his courage on Shebu about the identity and phone number of the big man, Shark (Dick Merrifield "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so undamaged that Detective Jackson describes him as "a guy with all the right answers." Sheba Baby "is not a first-class Pam Grier. The idea that our heroine can handle everything without the help of boys makes her interesting and fun.
