Okay, well, no one in their right mind would have taken a movie called "The Man with a Screaming Brain" and expected it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and it means really hokey fence, weird characters, clich√©s, over-the-top events, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For this strange segment of the population (including mine) that gets out of this kind of thing, it's a gem. Acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is anchored in his character. Bruce Campbell delivers a lively, convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are really impressive in this movie and listen back to "Evil Dead" movies.
