I expected it to be good after seeing some more amazing moments of ozone and reading a lot about it ... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very clear (emotionally and visually), perfect at all times. Every movement is for some reason, everything is so tight and primitive true and honest. this is a film about beauty and innocence; about its simplicity.
