I first saw this movie in the late 1960s and tried to see it every time it was on television, which unfortunately is often not the case. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will be at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. In Officer and Gentleman, Jack Webb brings incredibly great performance as Sergeant Parris Island Drill Sergeant with classic recruitment, and the story in this, though dated, is touching and very well behaved. And having real glasses in cast certainly helped the film's realism. It's a great movie with first-class acting and a great story. Look, if you have a chance - it's worth it!
