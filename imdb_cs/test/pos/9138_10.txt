RED CIRCUIT (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). This may be the best film ever made, in the most personal sense. Men will never lose control here and never - not once - show their emotions. No dramatic explosion in this movie. They're all still cool. It is an abstract world of dreams where men live according to their own code, a gangster code with values ​​of the outside world, which is obviously missing. In this masterfully filmed lies saga, Melville solves the American crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style, but did in great fashion with a robust budget of ten million dollars and four of the largest French stars at the time. Alain Delon as Chief Thief, Yves Montand as alcoholic former cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as escaped criminal and André Bourvil in atypical role of chief of cynical police. Melville described LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate movie and it's really a masterfully styled police. He also claimed that he wanted to shoot the film noir in color and in many ways he succeeded. The two primary influences for this film were John Huston's 1950 heist film Asphalt Jungle and Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot about the background of individual gang members, with all their petty needs and concerns that motivate them, it is clear that these are not merely ruthless types of underworld, but ordinary people dealing with the world But everyday worries and Human endeavor, Melville, almost tell us nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in jail? Why was his companion Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested first? Or why the former police shooter Jansen (Yves Montand) left his power, was his alcoholism? We will never know the motivation behind their actions and we will never find out what these men are driving. Women are even more absent than in their earlier films, with "emotional" ties exclusively among men. They don't even have a personal life. Some emotional zone of twilight and although the setting is not as abstract as its earlier LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still draws a very scary world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost surpasses himself if you can imagine. Deliberately moving and over 140 minutes in length, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but his slow motion. The pace and length seem to be the perfect way to show the desolate world in which these men live. Nothing is ever in Melville's movies, and here's nothing else, every little detail is crucial to the story. Though LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite movie, Melville, it is one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 10/10
