I'm not going to generalize and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. It's okay, people feel very deep about this film, either you love it, I believe ... or you just hate it. I don't want to say the best of all, because it's just too "wide" to do so. However, I feel very passionate about the English patient, as well as about millions of other people. <br /> <br /> They say it all. I disagree with critics, on many levels, but those who chose this could not agree. 9-Oscars. 41-victory. 37-more nominations, makes this love story at the top of the game. From director Anthony Minghell, who breaks out on the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, "Elaine, I just can't take my eyes off!" In this case, I disagree with Elaine's reply. But the story builds and takes the right time to make it beautiful. Film cinematography (John Seale) has also won several awards, as it should be. So far, I have not paid much attention to Juliette Binoche. Well, it's not entirely true. I loved her performance in "Sabrina" A beautiful story about a rather complicated relationship, alongside Harrison Ford. But for her it was simply incredibly different in character and as deeply talented as she simply shone in her soft and graceful way was what this movie was looking for, I'm really glad it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also magnificent in portraying Earl Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his abilities after I saw this! What can you say except this picture again. (*****)
