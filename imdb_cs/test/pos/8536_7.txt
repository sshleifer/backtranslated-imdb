First you rent or watch this movie you expect in a B-horror movie. What this movie brings to a fantastic fan of this genre is quite a cheerful romp over the Nordic taste. Sometimes he reminds me of the humor of Jackson Dead Alive and other Stuart Gordons who will laugh at this little hit around the world. <br /> <br /> F / x reaches several heights really scary (the first time Ed meets his nemesis), but generally feels that this film was compiled by the af / x team, which decided to use any props available from other movies ... gremlins, devils, slasher movies, etc. into a pretty good effect and worked in through hallucinations. The jewel of the film is humor. Gore works most of the time, but more for laughter. In his heart his parody and fun on it.
