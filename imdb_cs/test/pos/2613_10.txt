It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I saw the first and second episodes. Works of art and animation are very well suited (see facial expressions, lol). The main character is the weapon that touches, the badge wears, the pair of ass cheeks, the shooting of who thinks he is offensive or "guilty". Meanwhile, the episodes had a simple and traceable plot that works very well with Assy's investigation. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, plays sober retort on assy A.A. antics and random "I have a clue" leads. Assy lines are very funny and clever, here's one: "I have one bullet and I have an e-mail address, don't make me send" * bang * "as if your in-box got some new mail. Assy McGee's headquarters is the same and consistent. When it comes to sound, it's perfect, sound effects and voice work are 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone, they all trembled, Don Sanchez, Mayor, Chief of Police, all have voices that "Fit" there persona is very well. I recommend it to anyone who wants to catch a couple of laughs before going to bed because it does air to adult swimming on Sunday evening. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
