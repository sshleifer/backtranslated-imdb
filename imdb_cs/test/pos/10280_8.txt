Not all movies should have the predictable end we are all used to, and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists. However, it was said that I was really disappointed with the l'apartment. In my opinion, the end did not really fall into the rest of the film and basically destroyed the story that was told. You'll spend the whole movie discovering everyone and his feelings, but the event in the last 2 minutes of the movie would affect most of the allones character, but the movie ends and leaves it too widely open. Overall, however, this film was very well done and, unlike similar films like Serendipity, all scenes were believable and did not cross the top.
