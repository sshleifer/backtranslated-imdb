Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the store, so it's no surprise that Pola X is almost the perfect shooting of the worst story. Seriously. If I could find a way to get inside my monitor, I'd have to throw Pierre in his life. No one has the right to be absorbed by himself, stupid, both at the same time, except perhaps Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre I need a big glass of brandy. I've never been so angry at the main character. Okay, when I said that Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any movie .... which means another piece of brilliant film making .... and I'm talking graphically By the way, here. However, Pola X will beat you from hell, so make sure you do it if you choose to watch.
