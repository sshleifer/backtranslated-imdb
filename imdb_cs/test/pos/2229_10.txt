Although often regarded as the worst movie of Peter Sellers, it is in fact an excellent posting of medical corporation and abuse of power. The film is often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of movie Vendor who was best known; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (Happy Days and Karate Kid Movies), but was marked by his ribaldary, animosity, and complete madcap demolition of the medical industry today. It was ahead of his time (1972) in taking an outrageous journey that Monty Python's crew would take to the movie some time later. As such it was for Peter Sellers' traditional fan, who found that the more sharp spikes in this humor are something they are accustomed to, are unacceptable. Peter Sellers' films are currently being asked by fans, but this effort where it will hurt?
