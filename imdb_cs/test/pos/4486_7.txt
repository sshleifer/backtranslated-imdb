By the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough of the Twilight Zones to figure it out. There is this special set of characters who find themselves at the bottom of the war. They're fine until an overheated soldier appears in their midst. It's his main escape guideline, so he collects power and puts them to work to reach the top of the war. There are many discussions about purpose and reason and speculation about their past, but nobody remembers anything. They represent different jobs: a bagpiper, a ballet dancer, a clown, a man in a disheveled hat. Why are they there? This leads to adventure and is solved at the end, but I think I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.
