I'm rating this 8 because of the premise of the movie. The meeting was fine, there was no one to act as amazing or scary. It is worryingly true that intelligent people have fewer and fewer children, or choose to have nothing at all ... while the stupid ass "W in '04" rises like rabbits. And although I do not believe that the earth will actually exist in 500 years, I see that it happens that Mike Judge is a parody prophet as a life imitating art. The world is driven by idiots and it will be worse when intelligent people with free thinking become a minority and "git 'er done" fans outnumber them. Evidence of this is our farce of elections. But I turn. If you're lucky to have played in your city, look. I paid $ 7.50 plus popcorn to see FAR WORSE garbage than this (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite anyone?). There are laughs, there are horrors, but overall it's fun. If you have half your brain, you will think about how this movie, though funny, is in place (exact) and tiny * a little unusual. I'm not surprised that this movie is almost completely unknown because Fox was the one who distributed it, and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see and think, "maybe I will read the book and not watch" Next 'Scammers' or 'Ow my balls'. "If our society doesn't stop collapsing everything and bastardizing the English language (ahem, Mr. Bush), then it's really where we're going.
