Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's just too long and varied and cerebral to be absolutely perfect overboard, especially with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstraction dialogue. Each production must include certain moments, scenes or intonations with which it disagrees. I've seen a lot of Hamlet's filmed productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott and now this BBC movie with Jacobi. As for the faithful, feature-length productions, this is one of the best. Most Hamlet productions are drastically shortened because the game lasts four to five hours. This production seems complete - that is, all Shakespeare's original dialogues are intact - and that is why it is essential for Shakespeare's scholars and lovers. And while these lines seemed to be rushing on rare occasions (for those who are less familiar with the text), the scenario is largely well-designed, well spoken, and well executed. Captions are available and very useful, although occasionally slightly lagging behind. Jacobi makes a very admirable job with the longest and most difficult role of theater. Actually, I called when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I did it before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the actor himself. The sets are minimal, so fortunately we can focus on the game without distraction or attention to necessities. In 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet can be walked on. But again, if you want a real deal, it's 100% worth it, even if you need to take a break for yourself. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and researchers.
