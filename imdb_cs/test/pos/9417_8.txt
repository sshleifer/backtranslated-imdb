Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal era tend to achieve quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their output being abysmal, or overwhelmingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit comfortably into medium quality, and as always, it's a nice trip that fans of the show like me will enjoy. This film sees Holmes in the middle of World War II a plot of evil Nazis to steal the invention of a Swiss scientist who could become a key element of the battlefield. World War II films Sherlock Holmes do not tend to be as good as those like The Scarlet Claw, where Holmes conducts private investigations because they are usually persecuted by excessive propaganda or conspiracy that is more connected to war than mystery. But this one remains far from both, and by focusing on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Maybe Universal saw what brought the former Voice of Terror and changed focus because of it. Basil Rathbone again puts great maverick performance as ace detective and while Nigel Bruce has no function As usual, it's nice to see him when he does it. Both of them don't spend much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes movies; But it makes more time for Holmes to showboat in different disguises, which is always a lot of fun. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite secondary character favorite and when he's not as fun as usual; his facial expressions are great and his presence helps to emphasize how big Holmes is. His scene with Watson in the car after painting drops on the road is my favorite movie moment. It's good to see Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty will return, though it just seems to be. The performance of Lionel Atwill is not as good as George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes because he never really convinces himself that he is really a brilliant mind; but seeing him lock up the horns with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the movie to balance World War II themes that are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins as a thriller rather than a mysterious film; but as soon as it goes, it's hard to put aside and that's more than a solid entry into Universal.
