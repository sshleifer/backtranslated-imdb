Grand Champion is at first glance a little old fashion. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was the best "If Walt Disney came from Texas, he would make the Grand Champion" <br /> <br /> The movie has no video and special effects, but has hearts and souls. Children are great and many stars are incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie their kids really see :) (G rated) <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully created "simple" little movie made in Texas Texas Barry Tubb. Take your children, take your children friends, take your grandmother too ... everyone will enjoy it too.
