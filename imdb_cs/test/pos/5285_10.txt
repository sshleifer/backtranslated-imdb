Even from the very beginning of this film, I really love the artwork and arrangement of one of Japan's national islands. We see some big green hills and some oriental houses of the coastal town. We immediately look at the beauty of the Pacific on the wide screen theater. And to prove how big this film is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolutionary classes and school sciences, such as biology, would have a fantastic preference for a brand new film called Hayao Miyazaki called "Ponyo". The cover character, as you will see, can be the perfect media animation icon to be represented in all classes and halls. In addition to the scientific aspect of all this, let's immerse this exciting story in the blue waters. We have a thin, old and powerful wizard named Fujimoto who lives in a submarine and is cynical from the urban development of mankind and their pollution by industrial waste. He wants to have complete control over the sea and a cute looking calm water life including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is composed of half-human and half-amphibious, resembles an ocean-loving anti-hero and antagonist; Like James Bond villain Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me Who Runs Atlantis-dubbed Underwater City. His daughter, being treated as an exaggerated pet, is called Ponyo. It's a big goldfish that looks like a beautiful red-haired girl. Her father forbids her from the real human world and claims that it is dangerous and too much to deal with. But frankly, Pony's exploration curiosity is as strong as her love nature. In the end, a force similar to the stunning scenes of Nick Park's "Chicken Run" is being built, freeing his father's rocky and fossilized water town to float on Japan's water surface and bringing her happiness and joy into caring hands. Captain of the younger ship tanker named Sosuke. Living in the ocean in front of the house on a neat looking beach (or on a beach full of boulders), Sosuke has two overworked parents, older home working mother Lisa and the first friend of the Koichi boat tanker. Lisa seems to be angry with her husband for being away on the boat and leaving her with all her housework. Even more, the black magic that is being developed by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events to occur: the moon approaches Earth too close, and the waves heated from the imbalance of the tidal interaction forces, and the humongous tsunami of the wave ripple but evacuated city. However, this curse seems to underestimate and it seems to be literally more powerful than supernatural power, it is love and a firmly accepted friendship between childish captain Sosuk and the delightful red-headed Pony who wants to be a sensitive person rather than a canned fish. Like Curly Hair and Free Hobbits in Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> I could have written about this amazing animated movie, the best of it ever since. Coraline, who was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, enjoy your eyes on the next 10-star level from your Graham Abraham animation fan. 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films; however, Ponyo is the most towering film of many environmental beauties and should be married as a new miracle of the world.
