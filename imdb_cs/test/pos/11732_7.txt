I haven't seen every movie Burt Reynolds ever made, but this one (which I've been watching for the third time) may be his best! He suffers only from some slow stretches; Maybe Burt tried to make it more "arty" than it should have been. On the other hand, he has managed to avoid many of the usual clich√©s in presenting the role of "hard cop" he is playing (note, for example, the scene in which Rachel Ward first attempts to kiss or express fear just before the last clearing with Indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and those two ninja murderers are the three most memorable villains of the cop's thrillers 80s. The film also has some tremendous touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and catchy fistfight and many well-directed shots. (***)
