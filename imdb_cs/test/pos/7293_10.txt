All I have to say is that this movie is a bomb. You'll cry when you see it. This is a reminder to everyone how hard it is to fall in love. It reminds you of days during your youth when you were carefree, and everything that was wrong for you was washed away with one kiss. Even though I'm still a teen, I lived my life. When I'm with that certain person, everything that was negative in my mind was erased. So, I give this movie 10 for its honest message and touching plot. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give 10 for having a cute face.
