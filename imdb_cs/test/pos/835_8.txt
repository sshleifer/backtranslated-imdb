The original female Concorci Scorpion is a masterpiece of all time. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, in my opinion, wasn't so good, though it is still remarkable for taking the idea from the original and creating something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito did the same with the film again; The story here is a little different, but still he managed to take what made the previous records excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something original. Again, the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. "Scorpion") and this time she's out of jail and she's not very excited about the idea of ​​going back. After escaping from the persecution of police officers, one thing leads to the other and Scorpion finds herself with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting an impregnated retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and in a cage by someone, who she made the enemy out in prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before he returns to what he does best. The film begins great as we see Scorpion pull his hand from the copper to take her back to jail. But from there the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends more than the drama of the previous two films. This does not mean that there is not a lot of action yet - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in "revenge" and the film is not usually short. Meiko reprises her role as the sinister character of the title and is another undervalued, almost futile performance. Her presence on the screen is great, and yet she has a terrible presence, though she is physically small. The conspiracy structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all follows the crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have annoyed the Scorpion in this movie than in the previous two, so this section will take a fairly large part of the film. There are several surrealist sequences, not as much as in the first movie and nowhere near, like in the other, but the film remains at this point in the rest of the series. Overall, this film is among the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the other.
