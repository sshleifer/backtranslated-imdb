Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because she didn't have FUNDING movies. Obviously, whenever you want to create a story like this that focuses on African-American historical engagement (and NO, servants, and "mammals" aren't historic), Hollywood won't be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. Producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make "Posse" just so that the story could be told. I think it is commendable. Posse doesn't have to be an Oscar material (and they don't like the black media too), but it's a start. It's fun and introduces us to a black cowboy, a character most of us are unfamiliar with.
