I've always had this concept that Korean movies are about comedy and drama, but "Autumn Christmas" has changed me. This movie is so simple. He has a doenot of some melodramatic scene or top comedy scenes. It is not the only scene where actors scream loudly. Neither the scene where the actor and actress kiss, nor the simple kiss. Yet this film is able to reach out to its audience in ways I know. The end of the movie left me Speechless. I cried a little, but my eyes were red. This film left me feeling unable to describe in words. <br /> <br /> I don't think I would recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend this movie to people who want to watch a real movie. 9.4 / 10
