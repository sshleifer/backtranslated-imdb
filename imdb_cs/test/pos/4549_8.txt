This movie is cheerful. Laughter never stops. Each scene is filled with a limit of cheerful comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius and Spade plays his character to the tee. Farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever, and in this movie (as with all his movies) we see how much time and energy he devoted himself to portraying his character in the way he saw fit. "Tommy Boy" is an excellent example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
