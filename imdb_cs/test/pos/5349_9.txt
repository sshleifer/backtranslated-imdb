My only problem with The Curse of Were-Rabbit is that the film doesn't take time to properly introduce Wallace and Gromit to those who are not familiar with Park's short films. Oddly enough, "Close Shave" does it with much less time to spare. But I loved to see the boy in action and loved all the new characters, human and other. Especially loved Ralph Fiennes's voice as a shocking Viktor Quartermaine. It's also interesting to see the show on the big screen. The design with clay figures really stands out. It's hooves and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs, but I have all Wallace and Gromit and I like to add it.
