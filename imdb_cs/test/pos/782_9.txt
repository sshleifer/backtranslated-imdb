I only heard about driving lessons through ITV advertising and, to be honest, I didn't know how much I wanted. I turned on the TV last night and I was completely surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple movie that attracts you right from the start. Rupert Grint plays brilliantly part of the socially nasty teenager Ben. Certainly in the future. Dame Eve Walton plays fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple storyline and the way actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me, was Evie's rather varied poem. It shows how friendships can be created between the most likely couples. In my opinion, driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also remarkable, especially the countryside. Anyone who can forget this fizzy comedy disagree with it
