algernon4's comment that "ultralight dance in this film" is the most erotic in the history of movies is certainly a doozy of exaggeration. It's not even the most erotic dance of Debra Paget. Her close nude gyrations in "Fritz Lang's" Indian tomb make this figure look definitely tame. As for being the most erotic in the history of dance. Good! Where should I start? Performance by Salma Hayek as Santanico Pandemonium in "From Twilight to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba in "Sin City" (2005); Rose McGowan in "Terror Planet" (2007); Sheila Kelley in "Dance at the Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. Don't try to make me wrong. I love the sequence and included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think making a claim like "the most erotic in film history" is really on a very fragile limb.
