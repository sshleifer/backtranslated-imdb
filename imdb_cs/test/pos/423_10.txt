I like "Hack". Do you think the "Lone Ranger" was reincarnated as a taxi driver in 2000, a decent but flawed man in Philadelphia who was trying to figure out troubles from a troubled past, and you have a synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He is helping people, but instead of riding in the "silver" in the old west, he drives the cabin through the average street of contemporary Philly, without distributing silver bullets. The support cast is in first grade and above average. Sometimes a funny dialogue almost reaches the level of the classic 70's, "The Rockford Files". This show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time period than 9:00 on Friday (Eastern).
