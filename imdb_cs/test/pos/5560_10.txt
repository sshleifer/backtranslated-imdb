Farscape is the best sci-fi show season, for one main reason, all he tries to show is doing very well. From a technical point of view, music is an original and perfectly adapted show. Special effects are abundance and higher quality than any other thing you see on your TV. Acting is also great, too many shows today are used only by the American actors market for their performances. Remember when you first saw the Matrix and you said, wow, where did that agent Smith come from? His same feeling of looking at Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are great and that's in this great show. <br /> <br /> The story is top-notch. The next closest thing I think is Babylon 5 during the episodes of shadow wars, but this is culminating. It's a real treatment to look at all the episodes again, the intricacies of interpersonal relationships are well written and executed. The overall plot is original and thoroughly entertaining. I'm always itching for another show. The comic episodes are funny, dramatic episodes touch, and action sequences are tense. The start of the second season had several great comedy episodes that laughed at me loudly, something that rarely happens while watching TV that is not South Park, Sealab 2021, or Seinfeld. The drama is even harder, whether Crichton meets his mother or the characters who face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that action is a peak. That's science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan at least, if you like good TV at all, if you like a good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch Farscape. Yeah and Ben Browder owns.
