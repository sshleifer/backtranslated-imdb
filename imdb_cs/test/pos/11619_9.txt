First - this movie won't be for everyone. There are scenes with extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their very nature turn off many potential potential viewers. Of course, from the reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY he divided those who saw it. I am one of those who liked it very much for several different reasons. I feel it was a very ambitious (and quite competently downloaded ...) commitment to a bunch of 18/19 year olds without a budget and little experience. I think that every aspect of the film - direction, playing (although characters are more compared to theatrical or free performances because of the nature of the movie ...) production, FX, score / sound design - all are much better than many movies I have saw and that exceed these kids budget and experience ten times. I was not so impressed with GENESIS Nacho Cerdy's horror movie "art-house" ... <br /> <br /> First - I won't pretend to understand and / or understand all the graphic content in this movie - but knowing that it wasn't a straightforward type of movie when I went into it, I wasn't disappointed with how it went. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is a 4 relatively short vignette that revolves around the theory of true brain / left brain / anger / psychosis versus constraint / compassion / "normality". To very briefly give a synopsis of each "chapter": <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically only has a naked girl who has cropped her eye from her belly. I'm sure it's something symbolic - I don't think I paid so much attention at that moment and it blows pretty fast. Next "episode" - HUMAN LARVAE - is a nihilistic, horrifying, truly scary story of a guy who is in love and condemned by his pregnant sister who puts into her growing psychosis that leads up the shocking conclusion of this chapter . MEMBER LARVAE is the best of the book in my book and I will probably get under my skin. The Dead Men's Narrative Dialogue emphasizes the growing tension as you know that something terrible will happen - but you are not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you're interested in seeing this movie, don't do too much research on it. Go ahead with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you are pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. REBIRTH has a lot of people in the field who screw up the ground and blow trees and things. Apparently "art" interpretation of rape or something in this sense. It's not bad, but this is also very short and I didn't notice it ... <br /> <br /> And RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also along with human LARVAE, some of " the most difficult "images / messages from the whole function ... OVARIAN EYEBALL is not something to write about, mainly because it's a very short run time, but it does a decent segue into the madness that it comes ... and REBIRTH is also a bit short and not quite provocative, but human LARVAE (in particular) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so far from the wall and well done that they are more than just balanced. other parts. I believe that the main reason I liked this is that as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive" as it is, it is also very beautiful and you can say that it was for real work. love from the participants. Nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed, even if the content isn't completely decipherable, it's undeniably original - and that in itself is something that is in my book. Not that any "strange art-house" movie that has an incomprehensible plot should be praised for being "originality", but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is a type of film that I think I will see several times in the near future. what other interpretations I can get from it. Again, this film is absolutely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacrilegious images, etc., which definitely shock the viewer to look at this film harder. I must say that it worked for me, and I anxiously await the cooperation of Hussain / Cerda, which is said to be next. Check this if you have a stomach - 9.5 / 10
