This must be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to be trying, but it hardly matters. This film is extreme, totally wild and unreal. Packaging and marketing do it just because you * know that sometimes so often a mother needs to reprogram her child to accept our reality after checking out a video store that expects something completely different. Look at the plan, one thing! And where else in America can you see a ten-year-old boy, swear how he does it and then get his eye torn by a twisted Zed rival from Pulp Fiction? And the food inspector scene is the best! The number of well-known, vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: Soon, much sooner than you realize, you will also find yourself saying, "Is it a mass loaf? Is it Drew Barrymore? Is it the owner of a Twin Peaks gas squirrel car with a tailpipe car and isn't this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie? I think my favorite scene is at the very end, with Phil in the whole body. This director hardly has anything else on his name to return to Salem's, but in this creature he portrays a true stumbling man and a child! , I highly recommend this film for satisfaction, but the story of this film is too ridiculous, but imagine being taken out of context: * a boy fighting an army over an aggressive meat loaf that he seems to be trying to banish his anger when he's not admitted to Guns N Roses, looking over his shoulder and seeing a Voyager doctor stepping into the bar * Can you imagine what every semicircular surfer channel has been active over the past six years thinks will they see? Now imagine you really cared for Meat Loaf or Voyager! Or imagine you're a Flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this movie contains remarkable music, minds, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does it mean to you? This is a retarded, upturned mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. And what if Gus's sleeve is flying back on his arm in the special effects action program in cable access? When I saw this movie, it was at the suggestion of my cousin who, in the mid-1990s, was watching half of the mid-1990s, and who has been persecuted since then by vague memories of me doing it . he didn't sleep in three days. It made me laugh! Of course it is also an anxiety film. The music does not support tension, but eventually reaches the point where it has been fully demonstrated that the American Censorship Committee has completely lost the film and anything can happen in it, and Gus will probably turn the corner or view of the camera angle at any time. I found myself obsessed with the cards that fly out of the window at any moment. Check out this movie. Amazing!
