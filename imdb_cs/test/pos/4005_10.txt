First I want to say Ang Lee He did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and I was currently surprised. The story is very good, but all unconscious people would say, "It sucks people can't fly!" I'm telling them it's FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about the reality you could say is a "fairy tale". And very nice to watch Asian fairy tales. The image can really blow your mind. Because there he made such an artistically film, Ang Lee has a very (unrereciated u would say) great talent. The battle scene is very cold and beautifully brought to the viewer. But it's sad, but this movie didn't get the recognition it should get. But, fortunately, Ang Lee gained his attention he deserved with his blockbuster, who returned to the mountain. So even for viewers who are not interested in the story, the pictures are fun!
