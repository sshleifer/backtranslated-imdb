I really like The Wind and Lion. It was a good movie. I thought that because I was young and it was so long ago, I don't like everything so well, but when I saw it, I was amazed how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, I liked everyone I showed it. I liked it because it showed how the Arabs and people in Morroco were treated during the early 20th century, the Germans, the French, and even the Americans. If I was a high school teacher, I'd definitely show it to a student from a college perspective. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it enough to buy it for themselves. My little 3 year old cousins ​​even sit down and watch him. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
