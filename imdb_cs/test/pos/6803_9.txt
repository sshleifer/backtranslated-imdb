One of the permanent MGM classics was released in the final years of World War II, it's a movie that made the young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She made several films as a child actress before National Velvet, but when it came out, her place in the movies was secured. Ironically enough biologically, she would grow fast enough after the National Velvet would be out and her next fight as an actress should acquire substantial adult roles because the casting directors only saw her as the innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her jumping horses. I'm not sure how it would work because the horse's steeplechase must have confirmed bloodlines and Pi is the subject of the National Velvet. All we know is that he's a ruthless and unmanageable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen, and after being released and causing considerable damage, Owen gets rid of the local butcher, Donald Crisp, at the nominal price. At the same time these things happen, Mickey Rooney comes to Brown's family life, which consists of Crisp, Anne Rever's wife and daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is now on the open road and heading for the Brown family, where his father was once a horse coach for the Anne Revere family. It is he who sees the potential of Pi (short for a pirate) as a steeplechase jumper, and it is Elizabeth who persuades Crisp not to miss this chance. Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in the National Velvet. A good book says you have to have faith as a child and she has it available. He brings Rooney with him to have faith in the heart and ability of Pi and keep himself a little for himself. Anne Revere won Best Supporting Actress Award for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience has no suspicion. It turns out that in her youth the taste of fame and fame of swimming the English Channel and her prize money, all these years saved, gives her daughter. The scene is probably what Oscar won. The National Velvet also won one more Academy Award for film editing. More than 60 years after her National Velvet debut as a family classic, she has lost nothing. His portrayal of life between world wars in the UK is still a standout. And the National Velvet has launched a film legend. I can't do much better than what's important to them.
