living in Romania I was almost overwhelmed by the very realistic setting of the scenes and the great care devoted to the director's local details. Anthony Queen's performance is absolutely great and the rest of the cast supports him greatly. The film has little knowledge of the East European context, so that it can be fully enjoyed, but otherwise remains a great performance with some unforgettable lines. The end is perhaps a bit too melodramatic, but this is actually the way people in this part of the world believe that the script is great because it represents the horrors of World War II in an entirely original way - no blood, no battlefield. Still, lives are fragmented and the smiles that you get throughout the movie are quickly killed by the reality-touching reality of the war.
