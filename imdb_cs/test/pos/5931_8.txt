Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. Match 1 sees Edge battle Shawn Michaels in a good but very long game. Another one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - Heidenreich took on The Undertaker in a boring coffin match. Match No. 3 sees Bradshaw advocate his WWE title against the Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good competition. The next match up sees Triple H advocating his tenth heavy weight reign title against Randy Orton in the big game up. Next up Royal Rumble takes place in which 15 Raw superstars and 15 Smackdown! superstars hit the ring to try to win the rumble and face the champion who could be at Wrestlemania 21. Highlights included Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder, who got his ass kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All the superstars beating Muhammad Hassan's bullshit and Raw superstars vs Smackdown! superstars! It's not bad PPV at all. Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 Wrestling Royal Rumble - 9/10
