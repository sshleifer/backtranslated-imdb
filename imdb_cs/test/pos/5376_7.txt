I have been interested in this film for a long time, especially after reading a few online DVD editions; However, I have postponed its purchase because of the excessive price tag and the lack of relevant accessories. When this year came out of print, I finally gave up - but the whole order (which included a number of other very desirable titles) was lost in transit! Fortunately, the DVD was re-released at a bargain - and I'm sure I took it! Anyway, it's one weird movie and a real sleeper: initially confusing but striking an occult story that can hit the bullseye with regard to both its stunning little town atmosphere and the natural eeriness of ominous ways. -on. The small cast responds perfectly to a riveting, immersive and intelligent scenario: the leadership of Strother Martin, in particular, makes the dialogue better than it really is with its zero performance as a city doctor / chief witch. L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (both of whom also produced the movie!) Offer solid support as a no-nonsense sheriff and his comic-strip aficionado assistant. The story combines elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and supernatural, and not just obvious titles: for example, the fact that a city is held under a spell that cannot be initially identified will, for example, cause one particular affliction in one's mind bourgeois households in the sublimely surrealistic Luis Bunuel. EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)!; the angle of "obsessed children" was borrowed, perhaps from the VILLAGE OF DAMNED (1960); there have been many films - especially of the recent year - where Satanic Witches rites' coven are shown: from Dead City (1960) to Devil Rides Out (1968) but, since negotiations take place in modern-day America (though in remote surroundings ) and revolving around older witches (looking for "renaissance"), the film they remember especially is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). occult scenes (highlighted as much more vague exteriors, such as the shadowy illumination of a devilishly decorated house, are presented in a very substantive way to be worrying and extremely effective - especially the initial tank tank procedure) crushing the car (!), the fury of the devil doll (a concept that has been done to death over the years, but here, it raises an undeniable friss), a surreal succession of dreams (set in an ice chamber where all victims are held because they cannot be buried !) where the witch is attacking a doubting member of the imperial corps, who is committed to riding a medieval knight (!) and the lengthy "black matter" finale (with the witch accompanied by the child will "take over", all dressed in red - with the exception of black cloth) Martin, who presided over the ceremony, culminating in rite The film also has the courage to add a favorable 'curtain', it's so refreshing to run into a title (albeit with a low budget) from the prominent Hollywood studio, Columbia, which acts so completely against Grain (as I said, the movie is pretty weird - it extends to cut and score)! The strange thing is that such a classy - and film - horror movie {sic} should come from a television director most often associated with Western and other family prizes! By the way, the same theme was dealt with almost simultaneously in Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing NIC's ninth collaboration, but NIGHT (1972; which Lee himself made!) - a film that I foolishly missed about 20 years ago when it was shown on local television and which has been MIA ever since !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of Satan's brother will surely contain spoilers, but the synopsis and works of art appearing on the cover of the DVDs will still give away!
