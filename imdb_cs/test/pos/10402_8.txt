The documentary director explores the seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents associated with the legend of an ancient demon called "kagutaba". <br /> <br /> From the movie's point of view, the movie looks like one of those popular videos. the last few months, even the one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, where most of these films are in complete chaos and chaos with all the upheavals, it's basically shown in traditional documentary style. She has television excerpts and interviews and fears are very subtle, well, with the exception of the last 20 minutes, when we go into chaos and where the fear factor rises tremendously. And it works. The film is very impressive and it does. Yes, you heard me right. You need to pay attention to the unrelated details that are shown throughout the movie, and the reward is great when these things start to blend together during the film. The movie is also very slow, which is a good thing in this case. As an audience, we come to absorb the details displayed on the screen, however subtle or glaring. First of all, it's a scary little movie. I am a man who is afraid of ghosts and paranormals more than killers who tear off teenage victims, so yes, the movie gave me some nightmares. There are some pictures that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer at the end where it makes you go "What am I watching?" Well, it's better unanswered. There are about ten reoccurring characters here, all of which have given authentic performances in their roles. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the end, because most of the questions remain unanswered. Question "Is that it?" he went through my mind. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the film is just stunning and frightening. I don't see this alone in the dark because you will regret this choice. Also in a few years I can see that Hollywood would make this movie. It will be interesting.
