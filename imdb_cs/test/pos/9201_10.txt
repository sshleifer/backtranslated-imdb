This show is amazing! I love all the actors! He has great story lines and characters. It's a perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. Both can be really funny. James Lesure is great! May be cheerful. Molly Sims plays very well. Writing is awesome! The show can really let you hang, which is one of my favorite show elements. I can't wait for the new season to start. This show is on the top ten of all my exhibitions. I hope this exhibition will stay for a really long time. If people know what's good, it will. I never want the show to end. At all.
