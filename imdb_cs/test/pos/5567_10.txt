Farscape - is one Sci-Fi show that has once again started to interest me in science fiction. But Farscape is much more than plain and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, Drama and much more :) Acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape survived his reversal and showed up with Peacekeeper Wars that he wasn't dead yet :) I hope for Farscape is the future :) In my opinion, it is also not problematic that some characters in the Show are muppets. You have to watch it and see what Farscape is. Farscape has set a new standard on TV and I think it will be really hard for new shows to prove they can be equal to or better than Farscape. I like this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
