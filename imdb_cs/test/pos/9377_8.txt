As a rule, there are few things that are more annoying than Hollywood's bold efforts. Mixing caution with difficulty, "movie news" pats loudly on the back for a bold solution to big problems. CROSSFIRE is not completely free of this color; this includes preaching about the nature of senseless hatred that is self-evident, provided that there is a level of naivety in its audience that is meditating on contemplation. Until 1947, it was a big job for the film to announce that there was anti-Semitism and that it was wrong. (It was, of course, unthinkable for Hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the film was based, his victim being homosexual.) Still, thanks to good writing and excellent performance by CROSSFIRE, he remains a persuasive exploration of what we would now call hate crime. The postwar malaise was one of the main components of the noir film and CROSSFIRE directly addresses it. The film takes place in Washington, D.C. still in uniform between soldiers, but idle, spending days playing poker and walking through the bar. Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war created emptiness: all the energy that went into hate and struggle with the enemy is now out of focus and filled. Samuels meets three soldiers at the bar: a sensitive Mitchell approaching a nervous breakdown, weak Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, who is a tall, overwhelming bully, who vilely disrespects a young Tennessee soldier as a silly villager. Three soldiers end up in Samuels' apartment, where the drunken Monty becomes increasingly offensive and calls her host "Jew-boy". Samuels is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears, making himself a major suspect for killing. The break-up of crimes is Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and by-the-book, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell, is incapable of murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny (Gloria Grahame), a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him the key to the apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who, as a witness of criminal holes, is terrified in a dirty house. While there is no real "whodunit" tension, the story will be preserved and the traps put to the killer are extremely smart. The strong noir atmosphere will save the film from the feeling of didactics or sanctification. Cinematography is a remarkable shadow game with ink darkness and harsh lights, rooms often lit by one lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. World fatigue is as ubiquitous as noir lighting. "I don't care," Finlay says quietly; "Nothing," is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame, paragon noir femininity, almost steals the film with her two scenes. Platinum-blond, tired and caustic, she is a quintessential B-girl, a poisoned "smelly mill" where she works ("for laughter," she says bitterly), her sweet face wobbly when Mitchell tells her he reminds him of his wife . Now and then, through her defensive shell, a kindly kindness like a dance with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, and then offers him to prepare her spaghetti. When he goes there, he meets a slightly confused man (Paul Kelly) who seems to be humming from Ginny and whose conversation is a thick lay of lies and false confessions. Gloria blows Mitchell's good girl out of the screen in a scene where she asked Mitchell to give an alibi. Slim and fragile in a bathrobe, with a girl's lisp, allows us to see how often Ginny was offended and rejected as a hiker. Robert Young is an unknown actor and has no chance against Mitchum's charisma, but he does a good job of retaining his smoky character, saddled with the delivery of a serious film report, that side of pomp. Mitchum, meanwhile, gets some great dialogue, but not enough to do it; Still, even if he does nothing but laze in the corner, you can't take your eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a totally shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of the ignorant, unstable bigot; we see his false genius, his bullying, his resistance to anyone with benefits, his "Am I right or am I right?" smuggling; How easy he packs the labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from contempt is. The CROSSFIRE report seems to be cautious and dated, though not so much the same year as the GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech on bigotry was freed when he returned a hundred years back to the example of a white sacrifice and reminded us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; Another might be people from Tennessee, says, or men who wear striped ties. Or maybe blacks or Japanese, or homosexuals or communists? The scenario seems to be afraid to mention the actual current problems. He frees his message by sacrificing the Jewish sacrifice as if his innocence is not enough; and to ensure that the army is deprived of superfluousness, so that the superior declares that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery, and points out that Samuels served honestly in the war. Nevertheless, it took some courage to depict, immediately after World War II, an American who could have been happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty were alive today, he would have gone on September 12, 2001 and defeated Sikh.
