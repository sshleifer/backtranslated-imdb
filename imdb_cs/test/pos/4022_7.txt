Brown has returned to his role since the year before (in "Defeat") for this rude sequel. In the original, he avenged his parents' killing by destroying a huge crowd organization in Mexico. Here, he is that being chased (by retaliation) by money laundering portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action once, kicking a gangster ass everywhere while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was generally a better and more cohesive film, it all brings all the benefits of using it in much heavier doses, making it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. In addition to the rather dreary opening of the horse and downright deadly car ride on the city street at night, this movie is screaming at a very fast pace. One or more of the following cases occur every few minutes: drug use, sex, nudity, shooting, murder or other action. Brown is his usual reliable, friendly self, assisted by his amazing physical presence, which goes far beyond the stiffness of his acting. McMahon is a rebellion! With colored glasses and hair distributed in the middle (!) He is shown to give orders to his gangs of gangs and overheard a passionate love for his fur-dressed bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson sidekick in a role like this is perverted. Stroud impresses as an intense, racially-bigoted hit-man, while Peters adds a mere class as an honest police detective who supports Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention is ever made of the original Brown sidekicks by Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is pleasing enough, but lacks sensuality and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes a nasty turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick a girl from the bar and make her an immediate member of his harem. Cinematography and overall direction are less polished than the first movie, but this has a disc and a sense of danger that exceeds the original feeling. The film spends a lot of time in the wastewater of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now surprising lack of political correctness. One weird note: The key player in the first film was subjected to death, but appeared here in a different role.
