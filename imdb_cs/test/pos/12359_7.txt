In Sweden there was once a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, he asks, "Send to David Holm!" But Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) cannot be placed because he is spending New Year's Eve in a cemetery with friends for drinking. Dying Nurse Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if the prayer for Mr. Sjöström's soul in the last year has yielded some results; probably not. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person who dies every year must pick up the souls of all dead until he escapes on New Year's Eve… Director Sjöström, whose performance is very strong, combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing movie. The large "double exposure" effect is used often but never seems to be exaggerated; and it does not mean that other dramatic events of the film are less memorable (for example, Sjöström tears its sewn coat and door ax). The story of Selma Lagerlöf was probably not the one you could or would like to manipulate in the 1920s - which may or may not be the reason why the end of this film is disappointing. And unlike similar spiritual stories, it's hard to suspend your infidelity if you think about what's really going on in Körkarlen. <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
