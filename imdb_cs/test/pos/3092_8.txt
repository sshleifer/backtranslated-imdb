Fata Morgana is by far one of the strangest and coolest movies I've ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, although they have elements of his image documentation, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear that I wonder if it is really worth telling this story so that these images could exist. . Essentially, the film is a story about Earth and the creation of the Earth from the perspective of an outsider, whether it is a stranger or something otherwise indescribable, all in the Sahara Desert. The title of the picture is related to the illusion or reflection of images, both real and hallucinated, which are often witnessed by people in the desert. These are also known as miracles. The film opens with an aircraft landing followed by an aircraft landing over and over and over and over and over and over and over. With each aircraft landing, the real architecture as the location it lands at and the plane itself begins to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective images. The pictures in this film grow more intensely and unusually as the picture continues. The story tells of the creation of the universe as the alarming sexual images of sand and the landscape move around the camera. The shots go on and on into the desert and Herzog movies they see and find. The strangest reflections of the world are exposed in the distance, while Herzog meets some of the purest and most photogenic collections of aliens you can meet. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack comes in, you can be sure you're in the world of a mad man in love with space. I can't say anything more about this movie without destroying anything, but I say it's a sober experience and it's nothing like that. I like to see movies that are only in their own classes. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog loves to mix narrative narrative and documentary work into an interchangeable form. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana has overstepped her welcome, but by the time she gets closer, she will most likely be burned into your mind forever. You must certainly see those who are obsessed with the nature and origin of the universe.
