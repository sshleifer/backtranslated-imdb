In the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled "Flashes of Flashes" in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were played for laughter. Scratched clips from old old movies were rearranged, screened too fast, and covered with jangly music and lame quips. The attitude expressed by this brutal treatment largely summed up the mid-century Hollywood view of his early days: the silent cinema was considered hockey, flowery, a little embarrassing, and only good for laughter. During the 1950s, this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. James Agee's famous essay on Silent Clowns for Life Magazine was a factor, but television played a major role in reacquainting viewers by silent films. It is true that television networks have sometimes treated the material as harshly as people with Flicker Flashbacks, but with a higher tuned series like "Silents, Please", the movies were treated with respect. Another milestone was the Robert Youngson compilation THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY, which turned out to be a surprise hit when it was released to theaters at the end of 1957. I don't know if Charles Chaplin was aware of Youngson's film or his success at the box office But it was about this time that he decided to launch a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies, THE CHILDREN'S LIFE BELT, ARMS IRON (both made in 1918) and PILGRIM (made in 1922 and released the following year). These three movies worked well as a trio because they contrast nicely with the chart, theme and setting. In addition, all three features of familiar faces from Chaplin are a joint stock company, some of which play multiple roles in each short. In the time of re-release films were not publicly screened in over thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was concerned with maintaining his reputation with the new generation of movie-visitors, especially since his best work was rarely shown on television in. Unfortunately, Chaplin had come to the conclusion that the films were moving too fast at the old, quiet projection speed, so it was decided to stretch them, which meant that each other was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid Flicker Flashbacks, but this wasn't the best way to go. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrible and practically destroyed the flow of films, but in 1959 it was released to THE CHAPLIN REVUE theaters, a version that was converted to video and commercially made available by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. . At that time I made a copy of VHS and I was terribly disappointed with the jerky, stop-and-start rhythm of the movies. It is a special pleasure to discover that the revival of David Shepard from Chaplin's compilation (originally made for a laser disc) is a huge improvement over Playhouse Video. The projection speed was mostly corrected. "Stretching" is in any case gone, even though the action seems to be pulling occasionally. For example: in DOG during Edna & Charlie's awkward dance at Green Lantern Cafe, Edny's bare arms appear visibly blurred; at another point, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS when Charlie is freed from guard duty, the action appears strangely slowed down for a few moments, but this may be the result of a film restorer maneuver to cover a bit of decay. . Image quality is fantastic with regard to the age of the movies themselves. Additional bonuses: The REVUE starts with backstage scenes taken at Chaplin Studio. This includes shots of an apparently staged, jokey rehearsal where Chaplin strangles the tiny actor Loyal Underwood, as well as Charlie scenes on his dressing table for his makeup and trimming the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's narrative, released by a quick clip. Chaplin has also created new musical scores for compilation, and in my opinion his REVUE themes are among his best compositions, especially those used during the A DOG'S LIFE caf√©. The only exception is the song written for The PILGRIM, a pseudo-singin 'Cowboy number called "Bound for Texas" sung by "The 1950s Matt Monro (sounding more like Gene Autry) that is distractingly anachronistic and out of place. the rest of the REVUE, the music is perfectly suited to action and atmosphere. It's like the release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE in some sense was a long delayed presentation of these classic comedies as intended all the time. In this form, REVUE is one of Chaplin's most durable and enjoyable works.
