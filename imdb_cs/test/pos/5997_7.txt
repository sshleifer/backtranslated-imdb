This version of Gulliver's stories is definitely bizarre. Production adds a frame to the story (that's what becomes famous) Gulliver returns to his wife and son. In one vieweing, incredibly elongated and sometimes unable to maintain attention throughout, but odd images and a diverse cast will make you look. Mary Steenburgen does the best job cast. Danson, with his American accent, seems a little out of the way. The whole asylum is often very worrying, but it is interesting and keeps Gulliver's journey well. Indeed, Danson's character seems to be insane, but in my opinion he should work to be more credible to everyone. Also confusing is from now on to the past. Anyone else thinks Yahoos are the nastiest things that have ever loved the TV screen (or in line with it)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still accentuated by some good acting, beautiful visual effects and some nice parts. NBC is the first of many Robert Halmi movies, Sr. You see it yourself to decide how it will be for you, but I give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
