I really enjoyed the film, especially the performance of the extremely beautiful Gong Li as a concubine. It was a bit distracting, however, to make the Chinese Dialog PLUS English subtitles PLUS American-accented voice accompaniment, though the voice over was very well synchronized. Qin shi huiang di's (Qin's first emperor) surname was Zheng, and his name Yiong so in English he was to be referred to as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng", and not as "King Ying Zheng" as in those days two families / given names were not used together. The Qin state is pronounced "Chin" not "shin" - a pity that scientists didn't get this right. <br /> <br /> I forgave it, but at the end I was horrified when the comment was announced He was buried in "Zai-an" along with his terra cotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "See-an", never "Zai-an".
