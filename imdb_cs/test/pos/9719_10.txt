I remember my dad hiring these episodes on the video. My whole family loved them and now that I have moved from home and had my own life, I am trying to share these wonderful creations of Jim Henson with my husband and stepson, but since I'm starting to find out that not all are Henson fans. Which is a shame, because it means they will have to look for this series with me. But even if they don't consider them interesting, I highly recommend anyone who is holding a Storyteller. You will be lost in a world of stories from a time when people could talk about inexplicable situations through stories and how people have to take care of these situations.
