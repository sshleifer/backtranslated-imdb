Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing social values ​​and beliefs and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from idealistic rhetoric portrayed in menus such as "Longest Day" and "Green Berets", which seem more like Disney's fantasies in comparison. "Apocalypse Now!" the project, production and the resulting film, is the "Heart of Darkness" updated into the psychological horror story of the postmodern variety of the late 20th century. The cast and crew working on it would probably be related to the scary places that the human mind can achieve. This is the difficult situation of the original character of Joseph Conrad Kurtz who came into the literary being in 1901 and subsequently referred to in TS Eliot's "Hollow Men" (Mistah Kurtz, He Dead) 1925. Although no straight narration by Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" \ t 1901) not even firsthand about Vietnam experience, "Apocalypse Now!" it stands as a masterpiece that pushed the envelope of film potential. "Apocalypse" is not only about "horrors" of war as such, "platoon" and "deer hunter", but about the darker feelings of human nature that have been revealed in gross and humiliating confrontations of violent conflict on a massive scale. Apocalypse Now! not as seen as experienced. Most of the film is a trained secret murderer, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in the tour-de-force), aboard a US Army boat passing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where few people it treaded in the west. His mission is to end Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Special Forces Officer for the Army, who was a pet of the US Army until he left AWOL and the renegade in the deep unexplored jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official clandestine message is that the Colonel has gone crazy, but as the events unfold, something else has happened that is far more frightening than just madness. Sheen's mission is to end the colonel with the American public wiser. The film is rather episodic. The road along the river consists of several highway signs that Sheen and his crew meet various separate aspects of "war" at ground level. The 70's American audience has probably never seen this kind of film making, with the possible exception of "deer hunting" that was released the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is a helicopter battalion led by Cole Kilgore (Robert Duvall in Oscar-nominated performance) who is a hybrid between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. She loves to play "Ride of Valkyries" by Wagner's "The Ring" when she bombs helpless villages. His line "I Love Napalm Morning" is one of those cited lines from the cinema annals. Other meetings are an amphitheater, where captives will be entertained by lovers of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. Despite all the production disasters that prevented the record from getting to the movies, the remarkable aspect of this film is its stimulation. The original release (not a later version of Redux) will make progress as long as the viewer is not emotionally prepared to deal with the climate confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price. And some Sheen and Brando shots in some places are some of the toughest and most scary images ever made. Even lovers of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have nothing to do with Coppola in terms of terrible images. Brando's Kurtz in one scene, especially, is so scary that most of the other horror movies seem to be tame in comparison, which results from the recognition that the horror is not without, but from within. Away, Coppola's Climate Momentary Solution stands as one of the most innovative film revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would disappear in the melodrama and the atmosphere of the film would be darker. He wasn't sure how it would work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the solemn sacrifice of the ox practiced by natives with whom Coppola used as extras in Kurtz's scenes in his "village." After viewing Coppola's end, it is one of the most intrusive and beautiful sequences in the history of American filmmaking. To love or to hate it, no Western viewer will be the same after watching this scene. This film is not for all tastes as well as Conrad's original novel is not a kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It is not just the violence and the absurdity of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It is a nude revelation of human condition aspects that seem to be removed from suburban American life, making this film difficult for the average film visitor, which should be. Coppola didn't make a family photo. But if the viewer can understand his bigger point, there is a lot to get out of the Apocalypse! If you're looking for a cinematic experience that confirms already existing attitudes to American sensitivity and heroism, stick to John Wayne. But if you are willing to be taken to places where you have never been, even behind the rhetoric of "evil war", "Apocalypse Now" will take you to a world you thought you never visited before, and the worrying part is that that you can recognize it.
