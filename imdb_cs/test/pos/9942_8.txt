Betty is a subconscious for leading in the production of Verdi's Macbeth. When the car mysteriously hits the lead, Betty is drawn into attention. Opening Night is an amazing success and Betty decides to leave the after-party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend. But when a friend leaves the room, Betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown masked figure. An unknown striker joins Betty with the column, gagging her and placing the needles under her eyes, causing incredible damage and pain if Betty closed them. A friend returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such trouble. It is even more shocked when the killer catches him and pushes the knife through the lower jaw with such force that the knife tip can be clearly seen in the mouth. And Betty was forced to watch all this. So begins Betty's terrible suffering with a murderer who didn't hurt her, but also forces her to watch her mutilate her friends. it's enough from the model. Less emphasis is placed on the mysterious elements of the story than in something like Argento Tenebre or Bird with Crystal Plumage. A black-gloved, masked killer may be ubiquitous, but traces and red effects usually associated with good Giall are missing. Instead, Opera is about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable. Emphasis is placed on the terrible death scenes, Betty's fear and the obsession of Betty's killer. Opera is what I think are some of the Argento art scenes. When a killer catches Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure it's Betty. But a sadistic killer wants to force Betty to watch her brutally stab her lover's throat? knife in his mouth. It's a well-shot scene. And those needles in your eyes? brilliant. Or take the seamstress's death. At first, her death seems to be an ordinary murder. But when a seamstress accidentally swallows a killer's medallion, what started as another deadly scene turned it into a notch when the killer used scissors to cut open the girl's throat to get to the chain. Finally, is the most famous scene of death in Opera, which I am impressed with every time I see it? Mira is shot in the eyes while looking through the keyhole. The scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. He has a style to burn. As unlikely, it's a creative, unforgettable, and explosion that looks. Argento wasn't the first Italian director to focus on mutilation, but he took a trauma in the Opera. new level. The needles hold the eyes open, the bullet in the eye, and the ravens pecking out the eye are part of the Argento vision (pun). And these scenes have the effect of believing Argento was about to go. When I first saw a killer putting these needles into Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop blinking. In fact, it had a physical effect on me. What is it with the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in Italian films? <br /> <br /> If you want to be fair (and don't sound like a fanboy), there are problems I have with Opera, who keeps me from ranking as the best Argento. One of my problems is that the air duct system passes through the Betty apartment building. Although I have no doubt that duct systems are in older apartment buildings that connect flats, the channels in Opera are huge. I'm not an expert, but I honestly doubt a building as if this movie had such a mammoth air duct. It doesn't seem practical at all. And don't you think that someone has done something with them a long time ago to get criminals and shy neighbors out of other apartments? It's good for conspiracy, but it's not very realistic. But I think my main problem with the movie is with the finals. What's the end? He feels absolutely in place, clings to him and it is wrong. I'm not sure what else to say than it's horrible.
