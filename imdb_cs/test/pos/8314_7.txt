This dinosaur document was undoubtedly fascinating and very well executed. But I found myself watching a lot of unrest. In general, the film took a rather self-confident attitude to whatever he said and showed, but inevitably, much of the behavior of the beast, their interaction, what looked, how they moved, what they ate, and so on. guessing - sometimes guessing with reasonable confidence, sometimes just wild guessing. But the viewer never realizes it, the film pretends to actually observe real dinosaurs and their real behavior, etc. This seems to be better than confronting the mountains of renouncement, but in my estimation it is just a little too populist. .
