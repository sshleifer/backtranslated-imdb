If it weren't for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. If it wasn't for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, acting would be much more praised here. If it wasn't for William Faulkner, maybe Kill Mockingbird would never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found that this movie is unfortunately known because it showed me that one of my favorite movies Kill Mockingbird, maybe not as original as I always thought. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar film. "Whodunnit" is another, but basic story, a lone righteous "white" lawyer against the white southern city, defending a black man, is too familiar. The Mockingbird, written by a woman, focuses on rape, the ultimate betrayal for a woman, while this film focuses on her brother's brother hatred, a rape that feels fraternal. <br /> <br /> There's no Mockingbird depth here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you're just so sad that, whether he intends to pick up a plot from this movie or not, Mockingbird Harper Lee reflects it. Nothing has changed in the ten years since she could read Faulkner's book and saw her film while at Alabama College and unconsciously, or doesn't take most of her as her own in later years. Nothing has changed in racial relations, and some may say that nothing has changed now, many years later. It's too sadly familiar and one wishes our day to be Addicus to make it all right. Where Mockingbird leaves you hoping to swing in the arms of Addicus and awaits better times, this film will leave you sad that the pride of black people may be equal to or better than the pride of white people. But the pride of both is not the answer. Rather, it is the Addicus answer we need, the comfort that we are all defective, and that in our fragility we should have mercy, not pride, when we face each other in our differences.
