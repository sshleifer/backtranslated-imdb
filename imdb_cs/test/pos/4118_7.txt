This interesting film noir presents three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. Especially outstanding are the scenes between Sanders and Patrick. Unfortunately, Demming is not as good as a detective. He lacks the intelligence, strength and cynical worldview of Bogart. If Humphrey played this role, we could have a classic. <br /> <br /> Pace, the location (library) and the atmosphere are good. But there are several holes. Sanders is very afraid of Blackmer and the reckless organization (Nazis) he represents. After wrongly killing Blackmer, it seems that Sanders has not experienced anxiety or remorse. Sanders then catches the library and her residents by taking advantage of the ruse that he and his men are detectives investigating murder. However, Sanders' hit man later tries to kill Demming by shooting him (without a silencer), though many other detainees could be expected to hear, and become alarmed, by the noise. Finally, Sanders' hit man tries to kill Roberts, who discovered the truth, but when he faints, inexplicably not. But most worried me was that the chances of a big and unexpected conclusion were wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as a clever, stubborn sociopath who is not afraid. Eventually, however, he runs away from the panic that has been hit by the last surviving Nazi. Before the cops found him, he killed her. And he ends up as another weak, stereotypical victim. What should happen is that the cops find a Nazi robber, but he's dead. She cleverly killed him and then disappeared - to continue the evil ways.
