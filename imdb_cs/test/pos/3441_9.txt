I just saw the film for the first time in its entirety (although in the mid-1990s I was watching some parts when it was first released in Britain), I believe it's a masterpiece of the late twentieth century cinema. Undoubtedly, this industry's film raises a lot of questions, such as why are there any narrative differences between Hermann in the 60s in Heimat and Hermann? For example, in the first film Hermann has a quite significant relationship with his stepfather (he funds Hermann's electronic music), while in "Die Zweite ..." there is little mention of his father until the final episode. <br /> <one more point I'm interested in; Reading at Edgar Reitz I am impressed by the historical similarities between him and Stefan (the arrival of the spoiler) in the latest episode reveals that Stefan won the award at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz won Best Debut Award) to work there for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film company is called "Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion" and Stefan is also named eponymously. I'm interested in being Stefan an autobiographical character, because besides Helga he is probably the least likeable friend. Maybe Stefan is a red herring, I don't know what I know, is that I loved this movie and I wish it happened more, with the exception of "Cache" and Werner Michael Haneke Herzog " Grizzly Man "does not have enough ambition, courage and passion in modern cinema. I can't wait to see number 3. \ t
