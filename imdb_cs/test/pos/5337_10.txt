A great animated movie that really reaches oldies like "The Lion King". I went to see one of my best Belgian friends watching the TV show. I was lucky because I didn't know that people in Belgium were aware of "Wallace and Gromit". When it started and the good old thing started, the memories of me began to come back when I watched it when I was 5. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very fun. Some nice sit-com scenes, some word games or just plain jokes. The animation isn't so impressive if you know the series, but it's still fun to watch you realize it. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Not only can I keep my joy and fun, some of the humor can easily reach older people, so I say: Go and watch the "Curse of Were-Rabbit" as soon as you can.
