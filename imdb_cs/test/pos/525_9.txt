I didn't know what to expect from this extremely popular (and cheerful) Swedish comedy and satire when they released their first feature film. Wider satire? We receive four contemporary, unforgettable stories of family pain, especially generational gaps and paternity. But fortunately it's a drama and what a drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully selected, geographically different parts of Sweden. But every story could seriously carry the whole film if it grew apart. <br /> <br /> It's a dark, twisted, appalling yet massively fun and breathtaking performance. The screenplay, acting and cinematography are the absolute world class. They are four shades of championship and easily one of the best movies in the history of the nation's cinema. It is Sweden's answer to "abbreviations" or "Magnolia" if you want, and immediately on the same level as you! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10 of Ozjeppe
