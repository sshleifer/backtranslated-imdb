This film is a very descending remake of Fritz Lang's famous masterpiece "M-Murder". It is a well-executed and entertaining theme that talks about very serious events and current issues in Eurobe, but not just about the world. such a vast evil and very contagious. So "Wax Children" or as it is known in the US distribution reveals the question of German and Turkic hatred in a fun way. There is no doubt that it is well appreciated that it is a distribution by the great Weinsten brothers. most liked the participation in this film by the most popular actor Lars von Trier, the great Udo Kier, who shows that he is playing with such pleasure for Bulgarian director Ivan Nichev.
