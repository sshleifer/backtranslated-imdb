Here you can find an anti-war statement without looking too hard; this layer is plucked. Or you can find the value of a neutral commentary on the insanity of war (deprived of "judgment"); this layer is absolutely uninteresting. Or you can look at the fact that it is a very good value for single-layer Duvall, but it's just a coating for commercial mastication. Try to view it as a "realistic" war movie in Vietnam, but ask any veteran, and he dips the idea - most veterinarians say it stinks. Or you can view it as "will" or not play morale - there's nothing rich, either. Where I found out that value was in perfect confidence. Coppola needed a container of sufficient size (war) to fit the size of an experienced multidimensional actor playing "great man". Brando man was as much a maverick as Kurtz's character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting method, but he always excelled and won awards; "Generals" are uncomfortable with Kurtz's "unhealthy methods", despite his strategic genius. Coppola is making a Branda-size movie. In order to hammer in place, he places himself in a movie (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist loaded with multiple cameras) to spew his praise. Brando himself is seen only in half-light and silhouettes - the brilliant cinematography of Storaro that only increases the actor's strength. And he goes like a sacrificial bull to finish the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other interesting things: a great perspective of the camera view, including "being in a shootout" long before "Private Ryan"; terrestrial use of sound, notably ominous piping and sound display of an acidic trip. <br /> <br /> Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should do is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-control.
