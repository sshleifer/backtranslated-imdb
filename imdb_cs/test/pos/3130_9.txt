Watching Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford movies, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes Of Anger Among Others, But It Is Likely this will create a sense of respect and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help the Mormons train car get to California. On the way, they rushed to a pharmacist whose mules had escaped, a group of bank robbers, and several Navajos. On the way there is a lot of adventure and excitement and the film is full of fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The scenery, again from Monument Valley, is as beautiful as ever. And how can you go wrong with James Arness? Wagonmaster might not be one of John Ford's most famous films, but he still has to see if you have a chance. 9/10.
