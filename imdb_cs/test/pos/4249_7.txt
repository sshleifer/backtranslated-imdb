The film is full of black militant stereotypes and a lot of jargon of that time. In this sense, the film really dated. But as a satirical view of the American parasitic industry, advertising is still on target. But equally important is the counter-argument, namely the effect of the big money on those who would make industry more socially responsible, not the promotion of war toys, alcohol, etc. The film is also about the love of capitalism. For example, notice how Putney's clothing suddenly changes to resemble the revolutionary Third World world of Fidel, just before he breaks out of the company. For a moment, Swope's mini-revolution seems to have succeeded with his staff, and he moves on, perhaps to expand the movement. The former militants then succumb to the lure of the big bucks and go with a shake of their heads, perhaps by kidnapping the plane to Cuba. But Downey's last word is ironic because the Arab (I believe) burns the money tower and leaves a metaphorical structure (advertising, capitalism) a smoking ruin. It seems to me that change looks only as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reform - a message that is consistent with the radical spirit of the time. Whatever the subtext, some really funny moments, especially with ads that play as well as then. Those who compare the anarchist style with those of Marx Bros. Departure lines fly strong and fast along with outrageous assemblies. Forty years later, it's still a hard film to get consistent handle. Despite the curvature, however, the film remains a work of bold originality with some truly telling moments.
