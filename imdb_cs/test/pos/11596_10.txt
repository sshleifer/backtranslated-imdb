Much more eloquent reviews than this one have described quite spectacular acting, casting and styling for this movie. The only negative assessments seem to focus on the perceived imbalance in film loading with a major moral issue (euthanasia). This film is, the bar of the last scene, meticulous in emphasizing Ramon's belief that not making any big point but just that, for him, life without dignity is life not worth living. We as viewers see immense amounts of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture, but for his physical limitations he lived fully. The focal point of this film's tragedy is that there is really only one person who thinks Ramon's life is not worth living - and that's him. To watch this movie and say that the only counterargument coming from visiting a humiliating priest is nonsense. A priest's visit is a pure farce, a direct attack on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the question of euthanasia. Sister's sibling words to the priest, however, reveal for a moment the strong "pro-life" feelings that quietly rest the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see hope and the beauty of life that lived with love. As the film progresses, we can be gradually encouraged to understand Ramon's thinking, but we have never compared his decision. I don't remember a movie that overwhelmed me and provoked me like this.
