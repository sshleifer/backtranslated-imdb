I loved this movie. It's a very simple storyline, and it's based on a real story from what I understand. Growing up in the 80s with hard rock / hair metal can have something to do with my love for this movie, but even away from music it's really a fun movie to watch. Try it, you will enjoy it if you are not the hardest critic and only the movie "Citizen Kane".
