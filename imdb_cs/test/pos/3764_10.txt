Some said it was a celebration of the nose bite, but compared to the original Dr. So far, no drug has been developed for Hyde that could provide this effect. If Viagra was a slime podium phase, White Sparkling Powder is the evolutionary rail of Stephen Hawking (or at least the pharmacy idiot savings bank). This reality show is really about the sacred cows of medicine seen as an emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question health; both because most of us would not live to our present age if we were born before "modern medicine," and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to live if we have confidence in the helping profession. So the geniuses who made this film joked from Calcutta Bessy, which gives us sugar that allows us to swallow a modern institution of medicine. The timing was right, and many of them were able to see the treatment companies' trade side behind the Oz curtain. Ten years ago, when George C. Scott chased the Hospital, we and my wife were in a packaged premiere in Oklahoma City. As in the Jekyll & Hyde divide, we were almost unable to keep ourselves from falling from our chair, and we laughed and howl unchecked. Hundreds of other viewers were deadly quiet. They were shocked that doctors, nurses and hospital facilities were taunted. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the Animal Hall, a shirt of colored t-shirts and all who competed to see who could say the funniest jokes between knocking. If the hospital had been slapped rather than satirised, they could see what was shown to them. Unfortunately, they were like Republicans at the 9/11 screening of Michael Moore. Perhaps the smaller golden parachutes would be put at the disposal of corrupt medical corporation leaders, health insurance companies would have a harder time denying medical care, and health service providers would be demystified sooner if George C. Scott had a tap in the tutu to provide his terrible truth. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the movie, be consciously so happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best Saturday live parody ever and let the subconscious get wet in a documentary about the basic reality. I'm just not surprised when "Got to Got It" becomes one of your statements, or when "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide" occupies that part of your brain that is now paralyzed by "His Little World After All". Or when you start calling your local hospital Our Lady of Pain and Suffering instead of Virgo eternal construction. Even the Oklahomans have changed their favorite boss chief of the winner from "Piss on him and left him to the dead" to "Body in the Pit, you in it ....." Smell of Death ... it's gone! Chicken Sushi! Bier. BIER. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
