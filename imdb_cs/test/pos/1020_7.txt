Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller was found defeated and <br /> <br /> raped in the opening scenes of this TV movie. The movie <br /> <br /> then flashbacks for a few days before rape because Beller is harassed by a stranger. Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and Dennis Quaid are double dating. Beller's anxious parents laid down Tony Bill and scratched Blythe Danner, waited at home to wring their hands and so on. Immediately, the 1970s makes his old <br /> <br /> entry as young couples discuss romance and love in <br /> <br /> "Three Days Condor." Beller, an amateur photographer, is starting to get threatening notes stuffed in a locker room at school. The filmmakers wisely give us a number of suspects: Beller's new friend, Mattson's friend, Beller's dad, Beller's former friend, and what was that? too friendly photo class teacher who wants Beller to be a little more sexy in her self-portraits? I knew who was the bully <br /> <br /> because the Worldvision Video videotape has a <br /> <br /> attack on the back cover and destroys all the tension that <br /> <br /> Attention. <br /> <br /> Without giving away who the attacker is, Beller starts bothering phone calls and is finally raped. The movie then <br /> <br /> heads south as it does as Nancy Drew and secretly sets the <br /> <br /> time lapse camera to catch a guy stalking another student. Finally, filmmakers are advocating a hokey ending narration by <br /> <br /> Beller about a lack of understanding for rape victims in that day and age. The tension is very real without going over the top to the <br /> <br /> scary movie stuff. Beller is very good and watches her and Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater - they both do great work. The movie <br /> <br /> is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. This was done in 1978 and shows it. I'm sure no one had any idea <br /> <br /> that it would be reviewed in 2001 by an excessive horror movie movie lover who needs to get to bed and be early in < in the morning, but some of these attitudes are embarrassing. The teacher <br /> <br />, who tells Beller he is sexy, can never explain exactly what he meant. If today a high school teacher says <br /> <br />, then it would be for the TV movie itself. After Beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of her life, as the warrants are published, blah, blah, blah. It must not be a case, because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin, and cannot prove that she was raped by <br /> <br /> she said. Many of these problems have been solved by modern technological and police efforts, but this film apparently knew it would have the opportunity to join the reform debate. Rape is <br /> <br /> a violent act that has not disappeared, but today's attempts to catch <br /> <br /> attackers are miles away twenty-four years ago. The problem with <br /> <br /> is that the rape angle is fixed as well as <br /> <br /> then. Before that, we have a tight little suspensor who has an honest character to God. After rape, everything changes, film and not for the better. I remember Beller from the '70s and' 80s (and who could forget about her revealing role in 'The Betsy'), but she did nothing in <br. almost> ten years. This is a shame because she was a very good way <br /> <br /> at that time. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Are you in the house alone?!" based on <br /> <br /> playing alone, with the reluctance to nod at least the first two thirds of the <br /> <br /> movie. If you want to relive the 1970s for high school life, <br /> <br /> it's your cup of Tab. This rating is unrated but includes physical violence, some sexual <br /> violence and some adult situations.
