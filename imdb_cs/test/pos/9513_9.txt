As a spectacle, it is difficult to cause Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese benefit from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of film means that the whole world and the way of life in danger - through its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is somewhat stupid to have a drama where all Japan disappears under the waves; Why Japan? So suppose we have a film reality, a powered show (and popcorn), and some can influence it. Compared to the adventure with Japanese radioactive monsters, it comes as a more advanced and better run. The emotional element is underestimated and really works. (Is he losing a little overcrowded theme at the top, however.) Is Nihon chinbotsu trustworthy? Probably not, but thrilling eruptions and relaxed stimulation for a more enjoyable one-night fun.
