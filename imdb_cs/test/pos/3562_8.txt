This entertaining euro-western opens up a scene that precedes a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to make for "Once Upon A A Time in West" but couldn't convince Clint Eastwood to appear. . One is dressed as Man with No Name in Poncho. Next is dressed as Colonel Mortimer of "For a few dollars", and the third is dressed as Django, except that he rides instead of pulling the coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero will meet them at Main Street behind a car with three coffins. "Any Gun Can Play" is a western spaghetti with a western spaghetti joke, as the hero wipes out three murderers. Apart from a little too much comedy, especially in acrobatic combat sequences, it's an above-average oat. Notorious Mexican Outlaw Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his gang trigger happy pistoleros rob a military train carrying 300,000 dollars into gold coins across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" introduces a step from different camera angles that will bring you to the forefront of action. The bandits grab a locomotive along with a coach carrying gold and separate her from the rest of the train that houses the US cavalry. While Montero and his gunmen held Cavalry pinned, Pajondo ("Sabata" Pedro Sanchez) commanded the locomotive, killed the engineer and his crew, and drove her away so that the other pistol guns took care of themselves. Basically, Pajondo double crosses Montero and steals gold for himself. Later Montero conquers Pajondo in the Rio Grande. But before a bandit can reveal Monterey's prey, the cavalry sergeant shoots Pajondo dead. Before he dies, Pajondo tells Montero about the medallion, which serves as a guide to where he hid the treasure. Cavalry's Iraqi captain (Ivano Staccioli of the "Commandos") imprisoned Montero, but he couldn't even release the bandit language after he used the whip. The captain is angry with Monter's restraint and threatens to have a Mexican shot if he doesn't talk. Meanwhile, the prisoners let the priest talk to Monter, but he is not a priest. Six-toting gun Stranger (George Hilton "Ruthless Four") fancy dress as a cloth man and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is rescued, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of TV "77 Sunset Strip") takes the medallion away from him and holds him for himself. Clayton is a bank representative who was sent to protect gold. She is horrified that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to restore gold. The Stranger fires a fire in the fortress to fire away and Montero takes the captain hostage and tries to escape, but Stranger shoots him from the horse. Before the authorities can check that Montero is dead, Stranger says the body is due for its nice reward and will go out with the gentleman's kind thanks. Before they left the fort before Monter's men appeared to save him from Stranger. From this point on, Stranger, Montero, and Clayton create a short-lived alliance with each other as they seek gold. Castellari and screenwriter Tito Carpi, who wrote a number of western spaghetti, such as "A Few Dollars for Django" and other Castellari oater "Seven Winchesters for Massacre", rely on clever humor and surprising twists that keep the action fresh and fast. walked. One cool scene of Clayton was sitting at the table to eat when she heard some suspicious sounds behind her. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees a six-gun holster behind him. <br /> <br /> "Every weapon can play" up to its title. In fact, many weapons make the game, and at least twenty or more corpses accumulate before fading. This western is not so much a parody as it is knock-off Sergio Leone's "Good, Bad and Ugly." Remember, bad guys and good guys fall as often as ten times into a bowling alley, but their deaths aren't depicted brutally in western Leone. "Any Gun Can Play" is not taken as seriously as Leone's masterpiece. Three lead jockey back and forth for superiority. Everyone has a piece of puzzle that leads them to the treasure, but refuses to share their information until the final shoot'em. Lenser Giovanni Bergamini's colorful wide-angle photography is spectacular, especially the initial train shots that run along railroad tracks with distant mountain peaks that increase dramatically in the background. Another great shot is when Montero tests Stranger's calmness. This scene happens after Stranger saved Montero and Mexican minions come to rescue their chief of bacon. Montero confiscates Stranger's six-page and targets a tough guy who is dressed in a poncho, and empties a revolver. Bergamini, who shot Castellari's World War II thriller "Inglorious Bastards," frames the scene with Stranger in the background, and his pistol in Montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasant, three-dimensional style. Meanwhile, Francesca De Masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is unforgettable for its own idiosyncratic melodies, such as Ennio Morricone's Western Leone soundtracks. The opening song commemorates Hollywood's Western 1950s with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although not the main western spaghetti, "Any Gun Can Play" is always fun nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances, especially the incompetent Gilbert Roland, who was 62 years old at the time!
