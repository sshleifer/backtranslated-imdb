This film is as good as the first Jackass, but with somewhat disgusting parodies. I wouldn't say it was as good as the first one, but it came very close. Jackass fans won't be disappointed, but if you don't like the first movie, you'll hate this. There are scenes that will be seen as a classic Jackass (older suits with "additions", "ride a taxi", and many more), and those that you want you to never follow (eat crap, drink semen, etc ...) Overall, this movie was good, and I'm glad I saw it. I'm sure this film won't have the best rating for the critics who rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let this happen.
