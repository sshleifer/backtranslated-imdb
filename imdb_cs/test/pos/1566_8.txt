Six of the seven people who took the time to comment on this film have very positive reactions. One negative report happens (or did) on the first page of the movie placement in IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" is one of the best movies no one I've ever heard about this year. It's 6.4 ratings are misleading and can be more of a difficult subject than the quality of the movie. Who would have thought that a film that allegedly tells us about stopping prostitution is worth seeing? Guess again. For me, "Alice" was a positively psychological thriller. All the while I was practically on the edge of my seat. It is a very trusted story with a realistic script and is very well occupied. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would be honored to guess if she was good or bad. Ignore ratings and check out this amazing movie. (By the way, I wish there was an album with a soundtrack.)
