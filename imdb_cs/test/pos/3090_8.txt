As one of the other IMDb reviewers says, "... imagine 2001: The Space Odyssey in the Desert" and you wouldn't be far from a brief summary of what to expect from this cinema (I deeply hesitate to use the word "film"). Lecture on philosophical views on creationism, mythos surrounding the existence of humanities, sooner and later, that was what is and what will be. It for some perhaps "2001" on sand, but they engage in various philosophical aspects, one about evolution and the future, the hope and potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical trek. I just hope I can communicate this effectively. Herzog styles will not appeal to everyone, and those who are not perceived as hardcore spectators in cinematic observation may, and most likely will find it hard to go, and may not even see it in its final after 72 minutes. Fata Morgana brings together the image of the Sahara, including the villages, villagers and various other places for a somewhat surrealistic ending, music of different genres and almost mythical narrative, but Fata Morgana is very slow, but ultimately very beneficial. <br /> <br /> Beginning the installation of various filmed shots of aircraft landing for nearly five minutes, already extremely confused when arriving at a movie, and the feeling that it will not be anything you saw before your echoes in your mind . Fata Morgana, divided into three parts, Creation, Paradise and Golden Age, attempts and succeeds in being able to compare images of the natural beauty of the desert with man-made tools that teach it. His three segments are narrated by various people, each of whom specifically refers to the particular section they pronounce and give special emphasis to long soliloqus and desert montages. Fata Morgana is a film dealing with the existence of man on our Earth. He looks at the natural beauty that Earth has been designed for, while looking at the potential beauty we have in us, especially showing our negative contributions to the world we live in. Each film has been deliberately designed using what can only be described in the context of this film as "Holy Trinity Shooting" in pictures, words and music. Each part of these three pieces gives everyone something remarkable, but when they come together, they create something bigger than their entire part, creating unbridled beauty and deep thought in our minds. I will not be able to make this film of justice, which she deserves by mere words, perhaps if I have pictures and scores, and I know that the masses will not appreciate it, but that is deep and I will not use the term "artistic film" because it is just art . This is a moving art that drives the mind and evokes the soul. It does not matter whether creationism is your desire because this film is about smart design.
