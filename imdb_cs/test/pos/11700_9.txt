While not for everyone, Crackerjack is a pleasure to watch, with the tongue planted firmly in the face. The sympathetic character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, is scamming the local "bowlo" for free parking and making a few dollars on hand, selling parking spaces for work colleagues. When members of the Bowling Club need some money to save their club, they call Jack to join their bowling team and play competitive bowls. Filled with Aussie Charm, Mick Molloy's laconic joke shows through (also wrote the script) reminiscent of his earlier radio work. Perfect Aussie casting with Bill Hunter as Jack Bowling's mentor Stan Coombes, John Clarke (The Game fame) as a reckless entrepreneur and owner of bowls rival club Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as Jack's roommate Dave and Judith Lucy as a tired journalist, Nancy. Initially, I thought only Molloy fans wanted this movie, but judging by the number of blue rinses that leave the laughter cinema, it's a movie for everyone.
