This is an incredibly fun 80s rocker action / exploitation. Charles Bronson rules as Paul Kirsey. The rogues are badly bad. Soundtrack, Jimmy Page, is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street punks who are lost by Bronson and the crew. Crew? These are oppressed townspeople who have teamed up with Bronson to win the streets. The whole movie is nice, with the last half hour or so exploding into non-stop action and chaos. 9/10
