Some say this film is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie, but I don't feel guilty. You can tell the whole cast and the crew to have fun doing this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not go well with some people. Right from the start you can say that this film will be cheesy and certainly has an amateur look at it. Well, if you are honored to watch this movie, after you have noticed it, remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Snowman Killer Mutant is a pleasure, not guilty pleasure. Now, because I can't fill ten lines of heres some great scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Three women on the beach had great deaths. The first had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He was missing, so he dropped the anvil on her. Another woman fell on the bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed with pliers. Another great was where two stoners surfers hang near a frozen field. One of them gets the language on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back and pulls his tongue out while he says "COWA-TONGUE-DUDE!". Well, you have to see it for yourself. And of course, kids snowballs kicked their ass. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> endless stars
