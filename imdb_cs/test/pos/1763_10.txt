Could it be one of the oldest color films? It's actually the second. This is a very beautiful piece made by Thomas Edison. That was one of many of his other films. I think it's the most beautiful of all Thomas Edison's movies. It shows the girl to dance and move her dress all around, which turns red with the film. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you're watching it, you're tracking history. Watching what started making movies of the day! It may not have a plot or something very interesting, but this is the second color film ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to everyone, especially if you teach students to shoot or something like that, you need to show them what started color movies!
