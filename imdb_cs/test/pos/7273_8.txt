** BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Macleane (Miller) is a witness to Plunkett (Carlyle) robbery. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed), but not until after the big ruby ​​has been swallowed. Plunkett and Macleane then meet in the cemetery when they both try to catch the ruby. Unfortunately, they are caught as grave robbers and sent to prison, but not until Plunkett swallows the ruby. Ruby is their key to freedom, and as soon as they are free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is supposed to act as a gentleman and find out who's worth robbing and then just rob (and rob in style). But Macleane falls in love with her first victim's niece / daughter, Lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And Mr. Chance (Stott) catches them and his methods are not very nice ... <br /> <br /> Comment: Good action with comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller make up a good team with lots of friction and friendship. And then there's a relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The ball scene is very good, especially (anachronistic) use of music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of them, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the acting are stellar and are among the best in the film. Overall, the film works very well, a nice balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Very funny. <br /> <br /> 8/10
