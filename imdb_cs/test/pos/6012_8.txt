After changing small seasons from 1976 to 1979, George & Mildred moved to a big screen in mid 1980s. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cook, who retained their writers' roles, Dick Sharples was aboard. writer. Unfortunately, this film adaptation to the public does not seem to be in place. Shame. I liked it, better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) is interested in seeing if her innocent husband 'George' (Brian Murphy) remembered his wedding anniversary. Obviously, he does not, but try to convince his wife, otherwise he prepares a table in a restaurant where he proposed Mildred a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Upon arrival at the restaurant, he finds out that the place has changed hands. Eventually, Mildred saw through George's lies that they celebrated their anniversary at an elegant hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel, George is confused with Harry Pinto (Stratford Johns) as a ruthless man who wants to wipe out his opponent! It's not an excellent comedy as such, but the good nature of fun is the same. Unfortunately, the plans to revive the series after the film appeared were over when Yootha Joyce died on August 24, 1980 for alcohol poisoning. The funniest moment - George talks to his favorite garden dwarf. His neighbor, Tristram, crawls behind him and says '' I think his time was chat ''. George, who thought he had developed the power of speech, dropped the gnome in shock! Merry Christmas with other IMDb users, especially 'AdamFontaine', 'Cyril Blake' and 'TheLittleSongBird'. Enjoy good!
