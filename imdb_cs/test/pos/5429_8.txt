If you are going to see this movie, by all means do not go to this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely cheerful because you will be released. Yeah, sometimes it's funny, but I would consider it a political thriller that has become a comedy. performances are very good especially jeff goldblum as head of electoral society. Even if it has limited time on the screen, it makes a lasting impression. Of course Robin Williams is great. She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood, and this is shown primarily by one scene. This movie will come to your mind. What if a comedian ran for a president and actually won? would the country be better or would the country fall into a million pieces?
