It could be inevitable that with the onslaught of "slasher" movies in the early 1980s, that few good might slip through the cracks. This is a great "rare" movie by Jeff Lieberman who insured his iconic status with his unforgettable 1970s movies "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". Five young people head to the Oregon Mountains (this movie was actually shot on the spot) to do some camping and look at the charter to some country they got one of them. Before long, they will be predictably to be terrorized by a bulky assassin with an incredibly fearsome sipot laughter. "Just Before Dawn" is noticeably more ambitious, "art", and intelligent than some slasher movies. In fact, Lieberman crushes the characters - well, two of them just as much - just as a 90-minute film allows him. The film has real moments of tension and tension, and in fact abstains from the graphic gore, except for one killing at the outset. There's an above-average cast, including Oscar George Kennedy, and a forest guard who's obviously gone a little scaled to be alone in the desert for too long. Jack Lemmon is son of Chris, future Brian De Palma regular Gregg Henry, blonde leads Deborah Benson (it's too bad to become a well-known performer, judging by her work), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp "), and Jamie Rose (" Chopper Chicks in the Zombietown ") round the cast. Some shots are interesting, and early music scores Brad Feidel (now best known for his "Terminator" theme) is haunted and atmospheric. It is worth catching an important plot conspiracy around one hour's mark, even if the moment of about 75 minutes in engaging the heroine and the tree and the killer is almost comical; It can actually remind the viewer of a cartoon! One of the smartest touches is the final dispatch of a murderer I have never seen before in a horror movie and will probably not see myself again. 10 of them 10 because I can't honestly say I was so scared. Yet it is an interesting slasher that deserves to be rediscovered. "The deed doesn't mean anything, son. The mountains can't read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
