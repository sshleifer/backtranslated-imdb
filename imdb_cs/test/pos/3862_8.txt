It is NOT a masterpiece, which is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it is a very sweet, fun, romantic, well-executed Disney feature. Of course there are included lessons for kiddies, and some very suitable baby-cheeks, but there is plenty here for adults as well. Although it's a bit of a regurgitation Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some of the elements that exclusively belong to AristoCats. O'Malley is a "hiker" and Dutchess is a "lady," but Dutchess has a few kittens and everyone is trying to get home. Phil Harris is our O'Malley cat. You can recognize his voice as he also provided the voice of the Baloo Bear in the jungle of the book, and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her silky sweet voice to Dutchess. Directed by: Wolfgang Reitherman, who has directed or worked on every Disney animated film to mention it until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> He is one of my favorite Disney animated movies and belongs to any Disney collection. 2-Disk Special Edition is out of stock this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> This rating is 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
