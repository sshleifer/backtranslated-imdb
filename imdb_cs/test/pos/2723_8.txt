It's a great job of Aparnaji and some where people think that so far there are many more concepts that need to be expressed, and the film is a great medium. Well, all the great actors, together, say nothing about acting or directing, but the film gave us a big message. It nicely predicted the condition of the human mind with that patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own view, and therefore we want to solve all the problem. So when JOydeep spoke to his wife, he says that "he is looking for a thing he will never get" and the wife's answers "are we not all?" So that was a big comment that left me with a big question after the movie, 'are we all sick?'
