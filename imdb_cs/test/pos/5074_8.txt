Consider it an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking a position on US foreign policy, the process of extraordinary rendition involves persons suspected of terrorist activities in a foreign country, which is the opposite of extradition, if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime but a means. information. Instead of dyeing the soil with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you are doing it on a foreign country where these tactics are accepted by interrogation techniques. Naturally, given the severity of tactics and attempts to break a man, you would occasionally get what you want when you go through resistance or you get nothing, or the worst of all, to learn just because the mind was violated to the extent that the subject agrees with what you say. It is an ugly process and a better way to do this when you are a human rights champion, you give a nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting multiple lives, the age of information being the key to fighting terror, and doing so in the country , where there is probably a dubious record of rights. Rendering is in Syria this year, although a number of thriller candidates are available to run in the New Year. , with Rendition First, followed by Robert Redford's film Lions for Lambs, starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, though this one. would probably prove to be more controlled. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsotsi and take care of the new Wolverine spin, Rendition is a decent thriller with a cutting edge, a narrative that has proven to be very popular these days - a schism that provides a sufficient difference Perspectives to be presented through a cast file. Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, embarks on a journey to his home by ordering the CIA top brass Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). In a detention facility outside the US, CIA analyst Jake Gyllenhaal Douglas Freeman (oh, prophetic) sets out for his first interrogation session, undoubtedly drawn into a position he has not registered. Back Home, Very Pregnant Reese Whitherspoon is desperately looking for answers to her husband's disappearance and looking for help from former Alan Smith flame (Peter Sarsgaard) because she works for Senator Hawkin (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinmons, a terrorist conspiracy investigation and a hopeful forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), have quite a lot of action in a busy picture. Due to the abundance of castings, place, timeline and hobbies, the Rendition wasn't at all confusing and plays with skillful material handling, never quickly judging, presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. Every character has his own agenda, and exposing this agenda is big enough to keep you busy, and not to fool you. And the best part of all of this is how they leaned heavily on self-preservation in various forms and eventually in various situations where they lost their loss, unfortunately. He kept you guessing too - he or not he, and constantly playing with your mind whether Anwar deserves what he gets. He used one very clever hand fight that I didn't see coming until it was too late (so there was a loan), even though it succumbed to the usual stereotypes of terrorist militants, and without spending much time exploring their motivations. . Maybe he won't find a need, given the many films that already touch the base on this issue (Paradise Now, Day Day Night, Syrian even). Though it is rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy that bombs become a suicide bomber), I felt that publishing was right when there was no sweet ending that this struggle against the negative, destructive ideology was something that could be addressed in a two-hour film, and I'm glad she was driving such a fabulous ineptitude. Instead, we have a well-developed story that sets its weapon views on issue issues, and probably capable of provoking discussion as soon as the lights on which the campsite belongs light up - do you do support for severe pain in interrogation? Yes or no? This is a fundamental question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I've already focused on Lions for Lambs)!
