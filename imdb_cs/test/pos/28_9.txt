A fantastic cinema experience. I really enjoyed seeing this really spectacular movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it is a terrible pity that Sir Albert Finney is still not accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After the roles in such films as Tom Jones, The Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name just a few - for which he was nominated for an Oscar), The Dresser is probably his highlight, yet ... <br /> <Br / > I know, Oscars are just a popular contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ("and Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc. - and all deserved awards! ) why have they always left Mr. Finney empty-handed? On the other hand, John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny) gave it. I don't know, I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the two drivers at The Dresser, don't forget what art of acting is. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend to anyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> For this excellent movie I give 9/10 (1 point missing for non-film material, after all it's just a "theater") <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria are much stronger than on IMDb (10 only for a film masterpiece that could / could last forever).
