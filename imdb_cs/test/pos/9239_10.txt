After seeing Texas's story of betrayal, Cox's attempt at religious correspondence could not even afford a massive secret Stu deal that was not budgeted. This tells the story of devotion, sweat, marmot, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are interviews with Marci (she is such a hot baby child and she kicks me, but she just doesn't know it). The Japanese official dampened the lines that cracked me. The sex scene was really great. I'll see if Stu ever comes and does what I do when I do it with my wife. Intro and of course 5 seconds during final credits. I know it will have some chicks. I hope to see more of Antstuia because I know I can expect the unexpected.
