Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this film, but not in the way we think today sizzling - it's very subtle and below the surface - yet palpable. Especially Jennifer Jones is in this movie SO SEXUALLY HOT (much more than a cartoon like Monroe EVER) because she creates a real woman - with all aspects of womanhood: She is intelligent, intuitive, elegant. He wants and wants. On this famous hill there is a scene where it lies in the grass, looking at Holden, and the expression in her eyes is rated X, but in the context of the scene and character, in the full sense. You do not have to have everything that has been said in the dialogue - explained as a gross obviousness in most modern films. It's all in her eyes - sexy but elegant. She was an overwhelming, undervalued actress. (The first time I saw MADAME BOVARY and it was blown away anyway.) I'll take her over Bergman, Davis or two Hepburns.
