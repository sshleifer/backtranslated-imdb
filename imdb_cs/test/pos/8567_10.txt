H.O.T.S. is proof that the film industry suddenly told the censors "F-OFF" and filmed movies with what they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "over" and "extreme" to be anywhere beyond the velvet curtain. Although, BestBuy had a few copies at their $ 5.99 rack (if someone wanted to get a copy)! The movie was brilliant in its own way, in that it blended humor into a T&A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin movements, it had a plot. However, this is not exactly why you would follow H.O.T.S. H.O.T.S. is a college film that reminds me of the Revenge of the Stupid movies in that it requires a group of "average people" and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand! The only difference is that "Nerds" in this movie have a much better shot on getting laid! I noticed that there are some people who would rate this movie low, and for me it is ignorant! This, of course, does not aim to win Oscars or break the barriers in the film. If you are looking for it, then watch what critics choose for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot, decent gaming (for the most part given the genre), and lots of girls get naked! H.O.T.S. is one of the movies you watch to get rid of the problems of modern day and everyday stress, and instead laugh and have fun! If you are looking for a funny film in college that has enough skin to turn a pink Miata straight, then you should really check out H.O.T.S.
