This is one of the few movies that I was advised to be absolutely brilliant, that is really. If you give this movie a low note before you really miss a point. You could describe Foscu as manipulative, but what if it's really serious to get sick when the love she is sure isn't answered. But what would you do if you are sure that the other loves you and that it is 'just' rejected by being ugly. You're not going to fight for it. At least I think it's better to fight for dying in bitterness. It reminds me of how I, as a human being, react completely at first sight to the physical ugliness of Fosca, and I no longer look for the person she is or could be. This film confronts me with very serious questions about respect, trust, manipulation, and so on. How now, when someone is manipulating me or just trying to get everything together? I think the most distinctive feature of this movie is that Ettore Scola believed him to be in love with Fosca.
