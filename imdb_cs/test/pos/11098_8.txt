Falcon and Snowman are the true story of two children from L.A., who became the spy of the Soviet Union. One, playing Penn, is already a drug smuggler in his eyes. The second, played by Hutton, will land in an airline where his job is to be a top secret facility. There he learns of some of the dirty tricks the CIA uses for foreigners who don't like America. Remember that the film is set in the early 70s, at the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Horrified by what he learned, Hutton's character decides to betray his country and convince his friend to join him. Neither of them is long on the brain, it is not long before they get into their heads above their heads without going out. It's not a thriller, and it's rather slow pace. If this is not a problem for you, then it is well worth the rental.
