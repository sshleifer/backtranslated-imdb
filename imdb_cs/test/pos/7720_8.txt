This film is about a young Indian boy who someday returns home and gets in touch with a woman. The problem is he's gay. In order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until the spiral is out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny and I laughed many times. Sally Bankes' game is excellent and plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The land is also excellent. I have found that the plot is very realistic, and I can fully identify with Jimi's sense of fear, fear and excitement. On the other hand, Jimi's friend, Jack, is paid much less attention in the film. I would like him to have more lines in the film and to develop the character more. However, as I think the director wants to make it a more mainstream film, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. It's great to watch a gay affirmative movie. Moreover, this film preaches us to accept the difference of other people, be it sexuality, culture and way of life. This film makes viewers think hard. We need such movies to help us. Thanks for making this movie!
