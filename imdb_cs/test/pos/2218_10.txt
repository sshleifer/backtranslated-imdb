She enjoyed enjoying a new independent movie called "Half Empty". I usually go to the local cinema with my husband and I feel like we're being captured on the last Sequel, or the Prequel that Hollywood suits us. Was it different and surprisingly? So much more fun than anything Hollywood spends millions of ads. When my husband and I go to the movies, are we going to have fun? and "Half Empty" did just that and the movie did it so that I felt like it was my way to the cinema. It's a humorous, human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly enjoys in its simplicity. Especially I enjoyed the scene with four men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. This particular scene reminded me of the scene in "Phantom of the Opera", when 4 of the performers did not go, that is, they sang each other in a friendly retort. I'm not a movie maven, but this movie was more fun than any other big movie I've seen lately. It's stupid, funny, fun and fun. Very pleasant? which is what I expect from movies, but rarely comes as "Half Empty".
