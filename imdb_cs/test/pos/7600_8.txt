I saw this movie for the second time with my eight-year-old daughter and I remembered why we liked it for the first time. All these people who say it's bad are too critical and critical! It's just a fun little movie that doesn't change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as Guy - it was a worm that really needed soap and shampoo. If HE is to be hot in their school, then they have slim pickins.) But I turn -Drew Barrymore was great as usual, and David Arquette was even nice and I usually can't stomach it, just because of the STUPID AT&T ads! Molly Shannon is always fun and Leelee Sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain. Some parts were really painful to watch, reminding me of high school. Although I fortunately did not get out of fun, it was my heart hurting for those who do. Movies like this are actually good for kids to see - my daughter has made some observations about the severity of some students and how bad it was. This film is suitable for everyone and a good way in 2 hours. If there is sometimes a time when you want to see a light film with a happy ending where you don't have to think too much, then it's definitely a consideration.
