Seven-Ups is a good and exciting movie. It is packed with the trustworthy performance of Scheider, LaBianca, and Richard Lynch's effective scary performance - though most characters are cut out of cards. The development of the characters does not develop on the screen at all. The only thing we know is that good guys are good guys and bad guys are bad. Deviation from the Crime Story Standard, The Seven-Ups manages to throw Scheider and the crew into the center of the building plot in unique writing. At the site of New York's location and excellent choreography car chase to emphasize the film. The only downside to the movie is a slightly confusing plot at the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the kidnapped men relate to the crowd (later in the film). If someone blindly started watching a movie, he might be a little confused about the story. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a fun testosterone-filled time.
