Vanaja is a superlative movie. It has an extremely well thought-out cast where Mamatha is a crown jewel, excellent production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh Steersman, a fantastic journey through rural South India through the eyes of a 15 year old, remarkable mix of Song and Dance, traditional and modern, perfectly blended and beautiful background of lush color of flora fauna that make up a wonderful experience. What a huge success for the debuting director !! The cast was dead. I wish India came out with such movies. This film will remain one of my best favorites for my entire life. 9/10.
