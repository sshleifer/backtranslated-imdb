I was extremely amused when I read some bad reviews of this movie. First, many said they took their 4 year old daughters and granddaughters to see it, and they didn't enjoy it. At first I don't think it's a children's film, at least not a movie for very young children, not at least 4 children. It has very gentle humor, but it is not intended to offer a quick amusement as seen in Tom and Jerry or anything like that. Many people have also complained that it is very slow ... I think these people are used to "quantity" over "quality". Although I have a little quality problem with this movie and that is because the film was not as detailed as short films, I still believe that it has managed to do a pretty good feature film. And how can people complain about jokes? The jokes were reasonable, timely and thoughtful, never obscene insults or "on the face". Wallace is very clever, but careful and Grommit is the most beautiful, beautiful and beautiful figure that could be. It was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults, which is .... especially with the rise in obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there's nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for once ... and that was done in a very tasteful way in that ... while people deal with the aspect of vegetables that don't necessarily mean they're healthier or eat more of them ... but just that they are suffering with nature, in fact what caused the legend that the rabbit was filled. And for those who have complained about religious jokes, I say ... come! are you serious? Many villages revolve around local churches and legends / premonitions, etc. They are normal themes, they won't hurt. This movie was absolutely amazing, but some people had negative comments on it and I consider it absolutely absurd !!!
