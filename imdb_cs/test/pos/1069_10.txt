I saw this film for the first time about 15 years ago, and I've been charmed ever since. It is such a good experience that I could watch him happily at any time of the year. However, for me it's the ultimate Christmas movie. The fact that he's in BW is irrelevant - although I often wonder what it would be in color. You can just get that warm, shining feeling to watch Christmas events develop. Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together and Greenstreet is the opposite of his usual character, Sakall is a stunning joy to watch. It's a light relief, and it certainly doesn't tax the brain, but it makes you glad you saw it. I can't wait to be available on DVD in the UK. I'm sure I'll be on the front line to buy it.
