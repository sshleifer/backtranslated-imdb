Director Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian movie I saw "Dil Se", which led me to the journey of buying more than 122 Hindi DVDs during the four months of <br /> <br />. I can say that I understood the overall attraction, I was somewhat confused why the movie would stop on "music videos". It was a great movie, I didn't know what to do with dancing, and female vocals are a bit penetrating for my western ears, but somehow I found that AR Rahmen's score was hypnotic. The next day I bought a soundtrack and then the following week Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G and in addition to "Ichi <br /> <br /> the killer" a few other Korean movies, I can't bother watching much else. Something special for someone who only watched a strict Hong Kong diet, Horror <br /> <br /> and Action / Sci-fi movies over the past 30 years. But I should go back to Kannathil Muthamittal, it's one of Mani Ratman's last efforts, and I laughed, Cried, I'm totally crazy, scared, and most of all I didn't feel manipulated. The acting was great, the photo was beautiful, I think you could stop the movie at any time and notice that any picture would be worthy of painting. The music fits perfectly into the movie, and after the <br /> <br /> credits came back, I wanted to watch again ... so I did. It would be foolish to discuss the plot of fear that you may miss the joy of watching events and developing characters. This is what a great movie is about! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over! My wife is watching now and I can't wait for her reaction, I can't expect it to be less than mine.
