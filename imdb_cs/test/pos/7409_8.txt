This is one of my favorite favorites, a rare little gem that seems to be undiscovered by the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the work in what's well chosen cast. Few films have captured the real hostility that has underlined the civil war, but this seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you think it's a good companion.
