Undoubtedly, Werner Herzog is one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years and moves the boundaries of cinema more than any other commercial creator. I've met Herzog for several decades and I've never been so impressed with him, both by man and his work. Last year I went to see the Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised by how relatively mainstream the movie was, but couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew to a real jungle to not only film but also live. No other filmmaker is so crazy about the purity of the film process, and the ensuing tradition of such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been made into a film legend. Today I sat on Fate Morgan, a Herzog 1969 film that could be described as an allegorical postcard. Without exploring real places, I assume she was shot somewhere in Africa, coastal and desert, in a region that could once be the cradle of an infant, infant civilization, infant life on Earth. It is these beginnings, the biblical image of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that Herzog is interested in, as expressed by the narrative released in 79 minutes of running. Watching FM I couldn't help but feel like I was traveling deep. In the opening order, the title is translated as "Mirage" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple reps of commercial aircraft landing on the runway. These images are inverted, their 3-dimensionality being crushed by a long lens, layers of exhaust layers, heat waves, and light aberrations. The result brought me to a conclusion: things are not what they seem. FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) Golden Age. The first chapter opens with innumerable small paintings, where the bleak, barren landscape, rotting dead animals, broken shells of crashed aircraft, and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. People inhabiting this inhospitable landscape are ragged, helpless and seeming prisoners of the desert. The narrative speaks of a time before life, a time when the earth's linen was empty, and everything that existed was heaven. While the narration listens to a simpler, cleaner era, the portrait of a young boy who has a chanterelle-like animal in his throat evokes a chilling depiction of a cruel, ruthless attempt by man to enforce domination over nature. In the next chapter, we are more familiar with the same, but images and people are more animated and seemingly filled with a modicum of life and vitality. We listen to a biologist who talks about a hard-to-watch lizard that hunts prey in such a lifeless environment. When he holds a monitor that wiggles in the tongue of a fly, he also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in a burning 140 degree heat. Parallel is properly recorded, and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, sincere portraits of individuals who are beaten by the sun, desert, and laborious efforts needed in this cruel realm. He also promotes the theme that if he is not under control, man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant ways. The last chapter brings us out of a barren blast furnace and into the more familiar territory of Herzog inhabited by eccentricity and absurd behavior. Nobody seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the world's freaks than Herzog - maybe it's where they feel most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog decides to place his camera in a seemingly objective position that he can return to before returning the film. Subsequent flirting of Herzog's with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting far beyond the point when most directors would shout the cut. As Morris does, this widespread roll shifts around the "on" moment when subjects feel obliged to offer, and their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their facade recedes to something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is about a two-piece band playing a strange, polka-like song that Herzog recycles in this chapter. The band's drummer wears the same glasses as a biologist, just as another person does a magic trick, begging the question: what's with glasses? The film certainly adds a left, but one has to wonder if they have any deeper meaning or meaning, or just another example of herzog's playfulness. Storytelling aside, Herzog uses folk and blues music as the soundtrack of an experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen catches most of the time on the screen, two of his beautifully melancholic songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne". they perfectly accompany the landscape scrolling, which contributes to the convincing feeling that we are truly on the road. Towards the end of the journey, Herzog returns to one of the many shots that repeat throughout the film: a remote framing of a lone vehicle passing through an endless desert engulfed a water mirage that fills the horizon. The Crescendo film and the theme of miracles leave you in a hopeful spirit, despite the overall desolation of FM, believing that life will endure and possibly flourish against all the pitfalls. After completing this post, I referred to FM to find that Herzog shot him in Cameroon, just weeks after a bloody coup. Herzog and his crew were loyal to his legend, were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. While imprisoned, Herzog became ill with Schistosomiasis, a blood parasite. It's really hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as Fata Morgana; Knowing that the filmmaker is willing to die to do it, it's only because you respect him even more. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
