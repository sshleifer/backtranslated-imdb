After completing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Scorpion female prisoner series; both based on the comics of Toor Shinohara. Unfortunately, I couldn't see them all right, because it's the third in the series. It starts great when Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to get on her cuff, but continued to cut off her arm and left. If it's not bad enough, he'll kick his dog's arm later and see the trot down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treatment. Scorpion can also go to jail as life is not outside a picnic. First, the local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to return her if she doesn't; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But she doesn't hold her long before she escapes and seeks revenge. Soon they fall like flies. Certainly, some deserved to wear a shirt dress that was so large that it went to the shoulder. Madame (Reisen Lee) turns to avoid killing. Police arrive for her last kill and trap her in the sewer. There's a week and the cops find her friend (Yayoi Watanabe) supplies her with food. (The Story of Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but just random for the movie.) She tries to burn her, but this is The Scorpion, and she has some unfinished business. It's not the usual mix of sex and violence, it's a slow story that's beautiful.
