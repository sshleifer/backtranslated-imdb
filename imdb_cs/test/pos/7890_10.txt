I only voted excellently because this film took two pictures of America: one in 1970 and one every year thereafter. Nothing really has changed. Joe is actually a jerk, a big stupid fool who is angry with everyone else in the world because of his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the film is a big, corporate "never does" guy who brings friends with this semi-troglodyte Joe and gets some ... confirmation of his bigotry and stupidity and misuse. But few would argue that the seller's friend deserved to die. And those kids shouldn't rip Joe and Compton. And Joe and Compton actually got into the hash and the young skin until they broke out. A simple film in many ways, except that in 1970, New York City was, with Nixon's care, inconsistent with the combat zone and all the money for the Vietnam War. When I write this (2/25/2007), Netflix has "a very long wait" for this movie - which makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. It was a pretty good shot - not a precise, a bit cartoonist - but actually quite close to how it was then. And the scary thing is - things haven't changed much. Sure, there is no other welfare, but that just means that wage slavery has won. Amazing how millionaires complain that they don't make enough money, then they complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay to their people.
