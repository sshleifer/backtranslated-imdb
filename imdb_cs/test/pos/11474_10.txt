It's fantastic! Sick and twisted story of chance and deception. The story is carefully and cleverly designed. It is a really perfect blend: it has everything from tension to humor and the story is told with lots of originality ... The film is built as a puzzle that is assembled in pieces and solves the story ... the viewer has a lot of surprises to the end !! I also had the small impression that the director was inspired by some Hitchcock work. I also saw movies where you see the same event that happens from different angles, but this movie goes on. In this film, everything is built on what happens to the body that appears and disappears and reappears elsewhere. Every actor in the story has its own secret and we are aware of it in a way that contributes to the assembly of the puzzle .... I especially loved the dark humorous scenes ... which laughed at the whole theater .... This film needs to be seen for everyone!
