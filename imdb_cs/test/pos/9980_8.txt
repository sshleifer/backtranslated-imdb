Shia LaBeouf impressed me with her acting ability, but I can honestly say that I am very much looking forward to his further efforts ... his portrait of 20-year-old caddy Francis Ouimet, who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his place in life and enters US Open in 1913 in his hometown ... the beginning of the film is a bit stretched, but it is necessary to set up a non-commissioned officer who works so well that it works so well ... the whole cast is well chosen and work very well together in the story who ends up on the actual event and everyone can see what is visible, but even if they know that the information doesn't break the fun ... Josh Flitter is as amazing as Eddie Lowery, Francis's caddy who keeps him grounded and free and shows up that is an invaluable part of Francis' efforts ... Stephen Delane is outstanding as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer who idolizes, but or eat it. ... and who knows where Francis came from as well as he had modest beginnings ... Bill Paxton takes a formal film and makes it useful ... bravo Mr. Paxton, and bravo to cast ... from images to story to people who feed it, this is a movie to get, enjoy and have fun ... it's nice to have movies like this that we can watch well ...
