2:37 shows us admirably what Australian teenagers feel and don't say. These are the stories of real children and I think we would be naive to think differently. The only new thing that 2:37 brings us is Australian. We often follow problematic American children, but often we are unable to combine the same problems with our own teens. However, with clever and refined cinematography, I found (after instant recognition of the unsatisfactory final song) that the musical direction lacks sophistication. I appreciate the fabulous cast of this film. These are regular-looking Aussie kids who invite a lot of sympathy because of that. Great performances all the time and you can't win Gary Sweet, this film made me remember why sometimes High School was blazing, and if you're awkward or want to leave with warm and fuzzies, go and see 2:37.
