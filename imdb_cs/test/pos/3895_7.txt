I can't say this movie was merry, but I had to smile all the time. I like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in duffel bag" or "coldblooded" <br /> <br /> The way the main character tries to get away with the murder is a lot of fun to watch. For me, it wasn't too much of a surprise, but the way it ended was. Another thing that stands out is the way in which they engage the audience. The way Terry looks at us is cheerful, you can almost pretend to be his accomplice.
