"STEP BY STEP," is my opinion, it's a pure hit ABC! I can't remember every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to tell which episode was my favorite. I think it was always funny when there was a disaster at school. I always laughed at it. In fact, I think everyone in J.T. (Brandon Call) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) lines were funny. It would be nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) stayed at the show for the duration of her run. Everybody always gave good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. Finally, I hope he never stops broadcasting in syndication.
