Over the years I have watched this film several times and always consider it a fun experience. As a retired aviation pilot, I'm interested in most aviation movies and that's one of the best. I know that Lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris, and James Stewart was almost 50 years of making this film, but I can overlook this because Stewart has always been one of my favorite actors of all time. makes one of his usual excellent performances as "The Lone Eagle". There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the movie and good use of flashbacks. It also helps that James Stewart was a pilot in real life in both military and civilian life.
