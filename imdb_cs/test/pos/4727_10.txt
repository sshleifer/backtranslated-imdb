Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young boy who acted as a doctor who threatens the community to send his sister's son into the genius of his school. The only person who can stop him is a cop who plays his own rules and is forced to go secretly with the help of his muted father who communicates through the oujii council. Will Rick Springfield find out what's going on? Or will someone sabotage their recording studio! Does a mentally retarded boy who runs a cell phone book track? Watch how to find out! I do not do it!
