I read the book and saw the movie today. The story is so strong that almost every script or script would do justice to it. So there's not much there. However, it is still a beautiful movie because it makes a person think and feel just like a book. Watching it is not like watching a document about an unsuccessful state and feeling compassion for people who are suffering from a repressive regime, but it's like watching any other story of an ordinary person who is developing across generations across generations across continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemma, and finally his choice of redemption method could be the story of each of us. There is no single infallible character who looks up to idolism, but all are gray, just like all of us. Another important observation is that the film does a great job of recording the lives of Afghans over twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. Living, carefree childhood represents Kabul in front of the Russian invasion and the barren, ruined remains of the city that reflect what the Taliban has done. Child actors deserve a "thumb up". They can give everyone a mature actor to shame. If you haven't seen a movie or read a book, just go to the theater, keep in mind that you will see a multi-layered story woven on a multicolored fabric of human emotions and feelings. This film is not intended to upset the anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but to feel the attempts at human existence. I have read some of the web-related external reviews and I have to admit that I do not see a point in writing reviews that summarize the story as a distant viewer and point out the technical details of amazing cinema or something like that. At least for this film, one should try to join him rather than objectively.
