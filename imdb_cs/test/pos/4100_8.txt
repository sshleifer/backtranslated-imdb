As a film enthusiast, I obviously read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments on this movie (my favorite story is Woody Allen, when I had my life to live again, I wouldn't change anything ... except seeing the music remake of Lost Horizon "). That is why I could never watch him without grinning at the choreography / set / songs, etc. Recently I came across a widescreen DVD and for the first time I watched it for years, along with a friend who never heard of the movie. reputation. He really liked it, and - after trying to block all the negative prejudices I had about the film - I did. There is nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon and it is much more fun and secure than many other early 70s movies. . It's not even a camp. Some lyrics are more repetitive and simplistic, but it's not obvious when you hear them for the first time, or you have the drawbacks you pointed out in advance, so you're ready to scoff at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed that the cast could not sing in tune, this criticism breaks down because Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (also brilliantly because the vocals perfectly match their talking voices) and Sally Kellerman has a really beautiful and absolutely unique singing. Vocal, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "Things I Can't Miss" is excellent. Particular mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer with brilliant performance as a tall lama - and his comments on the destruction of mankind in themselves are a chilling variegation of today's broken world. I wouldn't think that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (things I wouldn't want to miss are an uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's "easy to cut" question question) You haven't seen the Lost Horizon yet or are you have not seen it for some time, try to watch it without it: "Oh, boy, let's laugh at this approach to the junk junk" and you'll be surprised at how fun it is. .
