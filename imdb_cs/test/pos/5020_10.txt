This movie is my favorite favorite. I am sorry that IMDb is not more positive about it. I hope it won't keep those who haven't experienced it to watch it. I've always loved this movie. I look at it about once a year and I am always happy with the film and especially the star performances of the cast. I've always wondered if Jean Stapleton actually did the last Travolt dance? ? If someone knows this little piece, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thanks and ENJOY!
