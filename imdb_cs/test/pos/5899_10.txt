I watch this movie every time it plays on TV. Simply brilliant film. Three men return home from the war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three led opposite lives during the war (executive banker became military corporal, soda jerked to become Air Force captain and High School football hero loses both hands in battle) and now everyone has to reconstruct his life and connect with the new reality. The homes they return to, with adult children and independent, working women, along with a depressed economy, only contribute to disputes. These are camera scenes and an unspoken dialogue that resonates loudly. The unpleasant intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his attempt to return to his place as leader (at home and at work) are heartbreaking. Dana Andrews is stunning as a handsome, decorated captain who fights to keep his life together without a uniform. The film is filled with honest characters and everyone is shown by a talented actor. This movie, however, took the next level after seeing "Saving Private Ryan." The reality and size of what these men lived for love and earth ...... and of course it didn't end up on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is necessary for every collection. > <br />
