This movie is my favorite Christmas movie for my family because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is all about. These days, living in a big city that I hate, I like to watch movies about life I've always dreamed of. The city in which this film is located is my dream that has filled with the life I have always wanted and the real feeling of the community that has disappeared in today's society. I really don't feel the real spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps to find the feeling again. My family recorded this movie long ago on TV and now our copy is worn out, so I would really like to buy a few copies on DVD for my family and me if someone could tell me where I can buy some copies just write info here and I will check. Thanks.
