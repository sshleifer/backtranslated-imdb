I just watched 100 bottom movies by IMDb users to see if there was anything to review that I still have and I found this little gemstone screen. One of the occasions when you see a movie that is rated as one of the worst, you just have to be one of the few that he likes. Well, well, I think I'm gonna get rid of it and spit on it, but for me it was pretty good to see it. It was a while, but I remember it was late at HBO late at night and I saw it two or three times and I haven't really seen it since and I would like to watch it again when I knew Jolie was in him. The story follows a cyborg and guy tries to escape the clutches of this company and some bounty hunters after them. I think that's basically all there is to throw a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good action here and there, and blood and violence. There is also a love story in the game, as well as a female cyborg and a guy who trained her to fight against the kinds of falling in love. At times, dialogue becomes a bit bad and is not by far the best film, but it's really good for b-movie. I don't know if it was a theatrical release, though because it doesn't seem good enough for it, it does it for one of the better direct videos if it was one of those.
