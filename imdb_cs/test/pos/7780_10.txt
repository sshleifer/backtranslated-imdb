Love Jones cleverly portrays young African-American men and women in a clear, positive, realistic sense. I feel that all the actors and actresses have been magnificent and really great at capturing mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate have worked well together and I hope to work more out of them. In fact, all the actors / actresses did such a good job that it would be great to see another romantic comedy. This film can be compared to most well-written, romantic comedies. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly recommend that you do it, it will definitely give you another look at life and love.
