When I was younger and today, Mr. Bean is a brilliant work. The triple BAFTA named Rowan Atkinson stars as an almost silent (miming) human-looking alien who fell to Earth and caused chaos and distress wherever he goes. He tried to make a test, put his pants in front of a blind man (he didn't know he was blind), went to church, tried to dive by the pool, ate on a park bench, saw a scary movie, turned into a car, had a flying picnic, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), taking care of the baby in Portsmouth, was in room 426 The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet match with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini in a new chair, and even met and set off the queen. Among the guests were Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock from The Think It All Over, Caroline Quentin, Day Today by David Schneider, Richard Wilson, Eral Maynard from The Fast Show, and The Vicar of Roger Lloyd-Pack by Dibley. It has been nominated by BAFTAs for Best Comedy (Program or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Program. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 Greatest British actors, he was number 24 on comedian comedian, and he was number 8 on the British favorite comedian. Excellent!
