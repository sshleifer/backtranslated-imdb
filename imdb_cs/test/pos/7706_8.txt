Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: these are two couples whose lives of addictions, crimes and misery are brilliantly captured in this raw and honest HBO documentary. They are turned, charming, repulsive, overwhelmingly stupid and dedicated: drugs and each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working-class boy who is clearly looking forward to his stupidity, while an early school lunge Tracy supports a pair of Western Union money from her father's moneybags who makes a surprisingly sympathetic portrait at the end of the film. Meanwhile, Michelle's widow (whose wife died at OD) earns her daily bread by acting as vice president of the NYPD who wants to cut down on her possible Johns to avoid jail, and sad companion Sebastian lives off the proceeds. You will be drawn into their stories and wish the film to continue twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this kind, we don't have the coda to provide us with information about their progress (can Matt and Tracy really keep that apartment in Brooklyn? Will Michelle return to Bellevue for further detoxification? And Sebastian can become more pathetic ?). As a result, the film seems to be incomplete, but it could be the right point. Necessary tracking if you are not completely scornful of the scenes of people who shoot.
