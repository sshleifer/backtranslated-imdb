There were many great comments about this movie and I want to add my voice. Yul Brynner has never been much stronger. His Major Surov was riveting. Your eyes just can't leave the screen when it's on. This is his movie. It is not a mild rest of the cast, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. Since they were mostly theater actors, they brought many nuances with their performances. For example, I've seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I've noticed the reaction of a German girl when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although not threatening, her utterly hysterical reaction made me realize that after World War II she had to be in Germany and was most likely raped by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of the story, which may lie just below the surface, forces me to see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.
