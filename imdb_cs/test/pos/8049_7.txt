It's hard to imagine that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith, was made a way back in 1914. It's a showcase for Griffith's new style. The story is centered around a group of settlers called Cameron Brothers and their families that include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent out from the east to live with their uncles and a young woman (Lillian Gish) who just gave birth. A group of Indians is trying to capture a dog pet and is driven out by folk. During the confrontation, the son of an Indian chief (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief repays his revenge and launches an attack on the small Elderbush Gulch community. <br /> <br /> It is this attack that is at the core of this brutal and graphical time. picture. Indians slaughter popular cities, women and children, and take them from the city to the Cameron estate. The newborn baby is separated from the mother and all hell is released. Somebody's getting help and coming back in time with calvary. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman who is alive alive, and there is a succession of seeing a downed horse. I've never seen an animal that would be so convincingly killed on the screen. Mr. Griffith has become a master of staging large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic drama Civil Nation, "The Nation of the Nation," which was released the following year. It runs terribly 29 minutes, but "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is an exciting and historic piece of filmmaking. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in bits.
