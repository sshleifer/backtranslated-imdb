Ann-Margret has done the best work she has ever done in her film making history. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There might be one or two Ann-Margret movies I didn't see because of her film debut in "Pocket Full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel like she was completely undervalued in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in "Who Will Love My Children," she was overlooked. Like she was nominated for an Oscar for her role in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy," she was determined. I all think they all did great acting including all the kids in "Who Will Love My Children". Yes, it's a sad movie (how true stories can be), but it's well worth it. Thank you.
