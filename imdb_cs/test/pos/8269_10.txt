Just reading a review of this wonderful BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed it when it was first aired many years ago. At that time I remembered waiting for another installment and fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, the two talented actors we don't see enough on TV or in the cinema today. I have tried without success to get a few fantastic BBC dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne Green Gables, all the wonderful timeless classic stories that the BBC seems unfortunately does not intend to release the video or DVD. If someone learns otherwise, I'd like to hear from them. Meanwhile, we'll have to settle for our memories of how wonderful they were.
