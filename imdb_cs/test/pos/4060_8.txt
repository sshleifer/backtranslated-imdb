SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's a funny mess. The storyline is forgotten, satire is a light and action sequence, though well staged, not so exciting. But I laughed. Many. This is due to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers single-layered ships, De Niro tears us apart or grimaces. This film gets RUSH HOUR-like income from critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you'll enjoy this movie.
