Don't listen to what critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. Madonna is great in this clever comedy. For years I worked in a video store and designed this movie for many customers. No EVER brought him back and shouted at me when I told them to rent it. Everyone always enjoyed it. It's actually a great movie for kids.
