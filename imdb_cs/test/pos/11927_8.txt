That surprised me. I've never heard of this movie the first time I saw it, and the title actually showed something other than college. Toy soldiers have the best of the early 90's, when action movies were light and very enjoyable. The action is good, the plot is interesting and the way through the top, the bad is one-dimensional hate douchebag (which is great), Louis Gossett Jr. It is, it's just a good movie that I really enjoyed. <br /> <br /> If you like the action, you can't go wrong with this. I give him a solid rating of 8/10.
