NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noira. It's about three salarymen who get in the way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheats p *** off three other guys one night at the bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who get into a much more devious non-goodness than the film, allow us to know to beat a live daylight from one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the thing in kind - only them accidentally kill one of the other guys! The other two baddies then begin the systematic destruction of everything that these poor schmoes hold expensive, including their rapidly diminishing common sense. Phaedra Video DVD Sleeve Features Critical Quotes Call Movie "Paranoid Street Crime Freakout!" or any such, and the term more than applies here. A tense, tense, very violent and unobtrusive (but still pretty slick) shot that was shot mostly at night with many deliberately unclear moments and motivations of characters who keep the audience arguing with the encircled protagonists (who deserve to some extent everything they get them!). I give him 10.
