This movie was a pretty nice watch for me, I think it wasn't great, but it was one of the better horror movies late. They seem to have been low, almost state budget benefit, but it is as charming as the beautiful ladies in it. The atmosphere was also good (which is what is missing from the hell of a lot of horrors these days). Negotiation was your typical low budget 80's affair that if you don't know it's "bagpipe" acting. But that's what Lucio Fulci movies were full of, they like this movie had the atmosphere they lacked in the story and the money, etc. They more than invented in horror and gore & the atmosphere for the film's own. It's just a typical low budget horror movie that is traceable, I've been watching it all the way and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I just turn off in 10 to 20 minutes or sit back and forth if it's on a video, or skip scenes on a DVD. This movie didn't make me do it, I sat and watched it to the end without going over the parts. I would love it if the type of zombie type of people in it was a little more frightening because they were just as frightening as having Freddy Kreuger as a guard, no. But seriously, even if it was a bit better, it would probably be a low budget perfection. Music in this movie was a top thing, ideal horror music, so it was. I saw horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank God that this movie had no music in it. I've been a metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies metal music spoils him, the film loses a lot of atmosphere when playing a different kind of music than score. So I'm glad there's no music in this movie than just your typical score, which was somewhat scary, well done. But it could use "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams". . Since it's music without keyboard, nothing except "really" spooky keyboard songs. Like the song "Forever Sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way and some goose bump inducing the keyboard music that follows. Sometimes watching that cd is the same, ideal horror music is the best, it would be appropriate for this movie perfectly. The only unattractive cat in the movie for me was the one that chibbed / killed (or so we're encouraged to believe) and hung up like a scarecrow just to get free and try to escape later. Every other woman in the movie was really beautiful, big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one I mentioned above. I wish Hollywood (the mainstream side of things) would give money to Romero and the one who made this movie. How to give them is for movies is a much better decision than to make it on a goon muppet called Paul Anderson of the "resident evil" coin. Good work guys, it's not bad, not bad I loved this part at the end of credits at all when they showed you how to make movies (behind the stage). Not many movies do this kind of thing that I thought they added to the movie a bit, as it also showed you have some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing when you ask me. Rating of this movie 8/10, rating for beautiful ladies in movie 9/10, rating atmosphere in movie 9/10, rating score for movie 9.5 / 10.
