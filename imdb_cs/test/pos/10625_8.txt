Overall, I found this movie well: exceptional gameplay with disturbing scenes (some necessary, some unnecessary) and weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided into two parts. I thought the first half of the Pianist was amazing. We meet Erika Kohut (beautiful Isabelle Huppert), piano teacher and introduce her to the world. She is single and tries to find room against an overly protector and border tyrannical mother. We understand that she has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releasing her sexual tension in sex-shops like voyeur or sadistic suicide. This first half is very clinical and creates an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. Then comes the young, handsome and outgoing man Walter, who plays Benoit Magimel great. Although Erik feels cold at the beginning, she seduces her and slowly develops Erika's fortress. She loves her deeply, but she needs him to fulfill her sadistic desires. Then when he falls for him, he is disgusted with his world and finally we find out that Erika is unable to make love or feel at all (especially because Walter is portrayed as someone you can't love). This is the second half of the film, very moving when we see that Erica's inability / inexperience with love leads her to self-destruction. This second half of Haneke looked less mastered and sometimes had untrustworthy (ie, too shocking) scenes that paradoxically reduced drama. Of course it's a rough movie at least in the French version You see porn sequences from sex shop, brave mutilation and sex scenes. The spoken false scene between Magimel and Huppert was pretty good, I thought and was central to understanding Erik's ill relationship with love. As for the actors, Huppert is amazing throughout the movie, Magimel is better and better to perfection and Girardot (mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
