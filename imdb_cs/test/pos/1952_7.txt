Pot-looking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (like Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (like Jamie). The doll is being washed, but a naked young woman will stay at the River's Edge to be seen by every passerby. Browsing a dead body is a group of twenty somebody's teenagers, mostly nude corpses. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy. Friends are interested in what to do with their guilt, a beer killer friend. Dennis Hopper (as Feck), who is a veteran, keeps feeding young people. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-size sex dolls with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a livelier doll and waits for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is remarkably crossed with backward reflection to open strangulation. The real teenager, in her first feature, is Mrs. Leitch's daughter of the 1960s singer Donovan. Make more unpredictable connections on your own. <br /> <br /> Depending on your mood, you can read a lot into the movie or not. Some background characters may be too fine. Most likely the teen killer teases; Note its weight, attitude and nickname "WC". Some character relationships and motivations are too vague to define, but casting certainly keeps the material interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are obviously skilled.
