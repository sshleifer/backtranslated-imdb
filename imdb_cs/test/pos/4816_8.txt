This eloquent, simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father. Although theatrical release, it has "made-for-TV" quality. We can attribute it to director John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the early days of live television in New York. Indeed, he conducted teleplay on which the film is based, "Blow Up," on the CBS drama series "Climax." T "Young Stranger" presents his Hollywood debut. After four years, during which he would do more television, he returned to direct "Young Savages" with Burt Lancaster and, a year after that, "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. Casting is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (especially well) who play the parents of James MacArthur (his first theatrical film), who played the same role in the TV version that was his first appearance. on a small screen. Look at James Gregory and Whit Bissell in supporting roles.
