We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival and we like it. This film plunged into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and, above all, fear of our own shortcomings. Three main actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo, are well suited to their roles and are excellent. It was a pleasure to follow the dynamics between the three of them as it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I believe that Barbora Bobulova is excellent. I hope to see much more in the coming years. This movie doesn't take an easy way out. Thumb to the Italian team who put this film together. Highly recommended.
