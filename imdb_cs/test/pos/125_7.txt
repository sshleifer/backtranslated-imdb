This is Deepa Meht's first movie. I saw a movie on TV in its Hindu version with its "Sita" character presented as Nita. I also noticed that it was Radha, who went through an allegorical test of fire in film and not Nita / Sita. What I loved about the film was his script, Mrs. Mehta, not her direction. The characters, large and small, were well-developed and looked quixotic to the end - somewhat like the end of Masurian "Unmarried Women". They are brave women surrounded by cardboard boxes. One carton (Ashok) seems to come to life in the last shot we see - carrying his invalid mother, Biji. It finally seems to take over the future responsibility for celibacy and respect for religion. Ms. Mehta seems to have been a director as a director (she appears to be brilliant in comparison with most Indian cinemas) because she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic common family she presents, in addition to a presentation view the Chinese micro-minority in the social environment of India. The film even devotes to her mother and daughter (not to her father!) Her Radha, however, ties halcyon days with both parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mr. Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali, and these giants are stunned - given her competent Canadian production team and funding! Mehta's film of two bisexual women in a middle-class Indian household can be sacrilegious to someone, but it merely captures the middle class atrophy, which does not seek to be better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films touched on parallel themes in India, but they did not have the publicity that would surround this film, and so a large group of knowledgeable cinematographs did not see it. Mrs. Das, Mrs. Azmi, Mr. Jafri and Mr. Kharbanda are trustworthy but not excellent. Mrs. Azmi is a talented actress who has performed excellent performances under good directors ("Chandar" Mr. Senin, "Paar" Gautam Ghose, "Ankur" Benegal), which is totally absent from this film. Mrs. Das sparkled because of her presence on the screen rather than her acting abilities. The strength of the film remains in the structure of the scenario, which is above average in terms of international cinema. I'm sure Mrs. Mehta can improve her talent writing in her future scenarios.
