When I looked at L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed, "How complicated!" And of course he's right. When you are accustomed to simple, linear graphs, especially violent hero programs Several negative reviewers have also omitted one or more important points here. Another whine about confusing flashes. Come on! This is not the kind of movie you can leave to go to the restroom, come back and reconnect in seconds. It requires full concentration and enthusiasm for details. Then it's not really hard to figure out what's going on and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes. The first 3/4 film center deals with the question: why did Max and Lisa break up? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find themselves again. With the experience of the French films, I predicted that the story would soon be sick and I was right. At the end of the first part, it is clear that after many turns Max and Lisa were manipulating Alice. Max didn't know Lisa had left and why. Lisa didn't know why Max hadn't contacted her in Rome and hadn't left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did this was Alice, and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut. Of course, after Max and Lisa found out the truth, the question is: can Alice's manipulations be canceled? Of course not, time has passed and things have changed. Many European films use the storytelling technique I enjoy. The initial conflict does not appear at first, then two (or more) stakeholders try to decide for their own benefit. Instead, the viewer feeds pieces and pieces of conspiracy and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a gentle and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice appears to be a side character; it is clear that he is a key figure. Negotiations are just great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as a somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a safe life just to hunt a past dream. Of course, Monica Belucci is very beautiful, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as a neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret. The only reason I didn't give her 10 is a rather unsatisfactory ending. Of course it was necessary because of the required symmetry. After all the events, Max is just wiser and sadder where the movie began. Alice paid for her sins. But small airport twists are a little artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max easily returns to his fianc√©. But then again I do not know how to achieve this without sacrificing elegant symmetry. Sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.
