It may interest people to know that this film was made without any sanction to Phoolan Devi himself, and, when she finally sees parts of it, was so furious that she announced that the film was not to be shown in India, or she would cover herself. in gasoline and light it up. I don't know if it was at all or not, but since she was a rising politician at that time, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen the news that she has been expelled from office and accused of other offenses from her Dacoit days, and as a result hid. Her own fears aside, this is an excellent film that has been all the more refreshed by the brutal approach; none of the pink melodrama that could be expected from a typical Indian film. It should be emphasized that the concerns about how the film's feminist message is really and so on are basically irrelevant: it is a real story. Her doubts do not seem to be with what is shown, but with the way the film depicts her.
