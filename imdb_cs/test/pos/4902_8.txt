One of Warner Brothers' best and highest grossing films during the 1930s was the charming family widow drama who lives with her young sister who raised four daughters. But not four daughters of the daily type. They were all trained by their musical father on instruments and one as a singer. They make some beautiful music together, even if it's for long hair set. You can watch the endless variety of roles Claude Rains has played over the years and still wonder when he shows you another aspect of his creative personality. Opportunistic Captain Vichy in Casablanca is as different as a scientist went crazy in Invisible Man, as a patient and wise Job in Mr. Skeffington. All the same men and all so incredibly different. Here, four girls are lovingly flavored with a bit of harshness in their willingness to accept modern music. Lane Sisters and Gale Page sisters may know Beethoven, but they are also cats with mushrooms, and each time they can beat eight. And if the rain gets a little irritated than Aunt May Robson can put him in place. With four daughters at a time when you know it will change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course the mating process is a bit complicated and one of the nurses suffers from tragedy, but promises to work as the film ends. Four daughters are also known as John Garfield's debut film. Other than a tiny bit in the Footlight Parade years, Garfield had no other film roles. But he was honored on the New York scene for his performances at Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed it and found the perfect film debut role as a cynical musician who just can't quite break his life. It earned him the best supporting role nomination actor in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. This movie was so popular that it practically spawned a small house industry for Jack Warner. Sequins with cast members like Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives all cleaned up at the box office before World War II. And Warner Brothers recalculated it with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day, who played on the works created by John Garfield and Priscilla Lane. Now the two were doing some beautiful music. In four daughters a timeless form was created and the film was made 70 years after the first vision.
