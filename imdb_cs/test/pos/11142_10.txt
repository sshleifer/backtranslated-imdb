I was sorry that this movie is not even popular in Hong Kong. However, for all to die a tough Chow fan, this will be a masterpiece that avoids b missed. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comic style, which based on the unrealistic and ridiculous plot propagated by Chow) at its peak. The storyline is absolutely utterly 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. Dialogue is amazing. No single part of the film cools to stop laughing. The story looked simple but crazy. It starts with Chow, who plays a juvenile judge (of course the injured) who is imprisoned in jail when he helps an innocent married woman whom he loves at first sight to get rid of the murder committed by the evil minister whose son was actually a convicted person. Chow escape from jail and escape as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and announce the conviction. On his way, he manages to pick up two beautiful women, one of the circus, another prostitute, while at that time he can handle the high skill of the quarrel and the bad mouth of the thin Mama-san (which will become his future in law). Finally, he managed to force the Emperor to reopen the case with the black Emperor's mail he had met with him in the brothel. The emperor made him the highest-ranking judge to judge the tgt with the evil minister. He manages to set up some brilliant but cheerful conspiracy that forces the convict to commit a crime, execute him while throwing an evil minister in jail. The lands are really fun and ridiculous brilliant. Also, don't forget the tremendous dialogue that includes some brilliant bad oral quarrels between Chow and Mama-san, the quarrel between the thick Mama-san and the thin Mama-san inspire Chow to learn the hassle skills later and also the dispute between Chow and the evil eunuch Lee near the end . In addition, some scenes are also brilliant. One thing to mention is that to really understand the movie and catch up with 100% of all the elements, it will have to handle Cantonese really well. Which may be why, at an early age, the Chow film receives only a slight response from the Asian world. However, when the Chow movie began spreading its influence around the world, hardcore fans like me found that his film was no longer as fun as the old one.
