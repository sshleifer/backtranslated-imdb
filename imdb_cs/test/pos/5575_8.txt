I remember ignoring the TV series when he debuted for the first time because of his view of Jim Hensen's muppets. But recently my friend had borrowed his DVD Farscape and now I realize what a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> As with other TV series, there are episodes that shine and those they don't. I drive adrenaline and emotional rush during major episodes and suffer through the bland ones. However, I endure no matter the main storyline that connects all the episodes together. I'm talking about the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. I'd like to warn you, it's something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. I can't remember any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that intelligently and intelligently combines such heartbreaking (sometimes) and thrilling rides. I think at the end of the fourth season, things eventually became tightly focused and I am shocked by the decision to cancel the show. I wait impatiently for the miniseries to be released and invite others to discover this incredible gem.
