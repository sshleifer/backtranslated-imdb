Behind the clouds is in many ways the strangest movie I've ever seen. Not for his cultural attraction, gore, or even for his ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this masterpiece of cinema. Behind the clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors. However, if you just put this movie on quick watches, I mean it would look like one of those melodramatic and often pointless novels. This film deserves a lot of attention, to the point that it covers all its cheeses. By cheese I don't mean a slice, but a whole cheddar brick! The music seems to be from some Italian porn, story and dialogue, such as from the stiff Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious that you want to break up. But once you get through this all, you're involved in an existential work of art. Cheese feeds on soft filming and attracts us perfectly to what we need to know. The basic plot has four chapters, unrelated and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what is happening or what is said, people cannot communicate with each other. Instead, they can only communicate with each other. I suppose that is why dialogue and conspiracy is so cheesy because the talks are too irrational with a lack of causality and people's reaction too melodramatic. I let the movie think for myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. We consider our feelings towards others as real and effective. I hate it because I have a reason. But what do you hate? Maybe he thinks my hatred is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. So melodrama is actually an existential function. Corny's romance is simply human interaction under magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
