Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinematography, directed this sharp, existentialist film of reconciliation, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the weakest moments of human condition. He plays as David Holm, no good nick who reacts to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later negotiate his soul with a phantom chauffeur: death. Unlike many silent movies in the period, the film is almost missing scenes with overreaction. Stimulation becomes lengthy with too well known Dickensian narration. However, exploring the film in hindsight and compared to the rest of its time is a very bold and unique film. Viewers of that time were not exposed to such an object, and cinematography is huge, symbolic and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi-layered flashes. Surely it is a really horrifying and frightening youth movie. Watching the movie is easy to see later influences of this film on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are on the full screen. Sjostrom, of course, later played in Bergman's masterpiece of alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's finale as an actor. Sjostrom founded the screenplay on the novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
