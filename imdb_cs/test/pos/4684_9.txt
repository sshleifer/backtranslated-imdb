Over the past few months I've seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The essence of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that the film does not have much essence for its modernist and high-budget technology. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you should sit, relax and enjoy a steady motion of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on characters and action at the same time without having to do much thinking (luck for some of us). True, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The storyline may have some holes (there is a huge about 3/4 way through), the action may not be so gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers will be, and some of the dialogue may seem absurd and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool Characters, Mini Coopers, Big Explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to abandon the fake Roger Ebert who meets Gene Shalit and has fun once! Oh, and the next thing you do is not to compare it with the original because you repeat what F. Gary Gray said to the millionaire journalist, THIS IS NOT EVER !! My advice - if you're interested in a nit-picking your way through a good-humorous, fun movie, don't even bother to see Italian Job. However, if you do not have a complex inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton being picked up by a Ukrainian soldier, continue. The bottom line, my fellow audience, is: Lighten up and have fun, Dammit.
