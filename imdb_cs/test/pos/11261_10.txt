This movie is about three teens who were best friends for the longest time, and go for the most messy ride of your life. When Heroine becomes a drug of choice in their city, these three juveniles will find themselves in all this. This film shows heroin addiction very well and is something you can't stop watching. MTV has never been the best in what she did for TV movies, but this has a lot of good content not to look at. I enjoyed this movie, at the beginning I thought it would be the worst movie I saw, but then, as it went on, it was better and I couldn't turn away.
