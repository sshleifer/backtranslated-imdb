A sweet, fun story of a young 17 1/2-year-old boy, dominated by a revolutionary religious mother and a withdrawn father, and how he finds himself in his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. He acted very well, especially Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of a teenage boy well, showing his talent lasts longer than the Harry Potter series. Laura Linney plays her mercilessly strict mother without a hint of redemption. However, the film is a very entertaining film that has been well created by the British in the style of Mami and calendar girls.
