Others commented on somewhat strange video edits. I think they were trying to capture what you're looking at when you play live. Legs, faces, general view. Unfortunately, it falls a little short. But when I said it, watching Colin Dunne is still pleasing. It's an interesting contrast with Michael Flatley in the original video. The course of the show is evident, the changes in the original production in Dublin are evident. <br /> <br /> "In my opinion," Taps Trading "is the highlight of the video. The original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD it is excellent.
