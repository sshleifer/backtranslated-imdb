Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I highly recommend using a DVD player with a teacher who holds his finger over the pause / play button. At the end of each age group, simply take a 5-minute pause and play on DVD, encourage students to shout the answers to the question, "What is it?", "What happens?", "What's wrong?" "Or any other question that raises the answers from the new vocabulary and grammar of this lesson. Because everyone watches TV, normally shy students are singing. Since the DVD can be started or stopped at any time, it is the perfect "fill" for annoying "times" when students leave and arrive. I tried another DVD, especially "Tom & Jerry" "cartoons and Red Skelton DVDs, but no other was as good as" Mr. Bean "at keeping students' attention.
