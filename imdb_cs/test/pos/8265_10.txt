I'm lucky to have a high quality copy of my VHS on my DVD so I can watch it over and over again. Characters are so well played I can't find a mistake with any aspect of casting. OK, so there are a few differences from the book, but the old clich√©s of love that conquer all are so powerfully rendered that they won't change that. The fact that we live in the rural countryside of England at the beginning of the 19th century is beautifully contrasted by changing periods, from winter biting to glorious summer days, reflected in various characters, from Father's bullying Prue to Kester's all-embracing love. A story that changed my life.
