This is a fresh, very fun drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is fine when the boxer hides from the police with such a colorful crew of Dead End Kids. The most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop, which has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young at home, is strong and attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the verge of fame, is eliminated. May Robson is very funny as a crunchy old grandmother, but Claude Rains proves that even a great actor can go crazy if he fails (who thought he would fit him as a tough New York cop?) <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley proves that he was a great director with or without music numbers. The film moves at an amazing pace and the water tower sequence is very exciting and well photographed. The end is fanciful and conspiracy nothing uninteresting or original, but I still considered it a very enjoyable experience.
