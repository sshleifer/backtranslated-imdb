Except for the main character, acting did not convince me, but the story was pretty good: It's about a love relationship between a gay boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and as such has several metaphysical undertones that balance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some story lines are merry: one of the main characters asks his homosexual colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he says, "Do you mean: except the Madonna?" All in all, the movie is not one of my favorite favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it is fun and stands against (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think it's an important message in our time. Since I rated films that I liked less than 9, it's definitely 10 for me. Some people may overdo it, but I think the film deserves it.
