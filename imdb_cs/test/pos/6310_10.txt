Where do I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know you're in a real treat when you see the opening shot - minutes and minutes of movie time spent on a guy standing on a moving vehicle. I don't repeat Rubin's excellent story summary. However, I would like to say that this film has caught me more than any film I remember. I sat with my mouth open and on the edge of my seat until the end. Working with the camera, soundtrack and fantastic * performances (especially Tony Servillo) will take you to the screen and will not allow you to break away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it is by no means just a cool style workout. It is a movie with lots of words about happiness, loss and love. <br /> <br /> Go and see.
