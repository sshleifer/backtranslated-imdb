I accidentally discovered this movie and it was a really nice surprise. Christmas Classic, it's also one of the fine comedies of the 1940s. The story line is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) recognizes her life by writing culinary columns for the magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), asks her to invite a young weakened sailor to the Connecticut farm she writes about. The only problem is he has no farm and can't cook. To get out of jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a rich friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful uncle Felix chef. Peter Godfrey is fine and the cast is really amazing: Stanwyck has never been better than this funny and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall are making fun and human characters. The only weak point is the leading man Dennis Morgan. It starts well, but as the film goes on, it becomes really boring. We almost apologize that Elisabeht Lane will end up with him, rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven, who would be more appropriate for this part. Anyway, it is a joyful Christmas time with a refreshing score and I recommend to anyone who likes to spend funny and sweet holidays ... in Connecticut.
