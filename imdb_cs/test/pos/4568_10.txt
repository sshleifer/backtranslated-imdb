I love this movie .... one of my favorite favorites !!! This was the first big movie my mom took to see me when I was nine. I highly recommend to all African-Americans. This story is about love, trust, challenges and the daily life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was on the video, but it's not yet available. I caught him on TV a few years ago, and I recorded it, so whenever I got the urge to watch ... I got it! The soundtrack is amazing too! You must see!
