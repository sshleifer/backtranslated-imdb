Garlin surpasses himself as a writer-director-actor in his indie production of a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. Laughter comes almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man who is looking for love, but has done it with great comedy writing and playing. Supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really enrich the film. Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role that takes you straight to the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is amazing with some of the big pieces she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in its role. I wish there were more in the movie than I think most of them would agree. It's certainly refreshing to see her in tight leather clothes. David Pasquesi was a reserved separate sidekick and voice of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom she lives. There were many other portraits, all made very well. At Prime Minister Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie because of manufacturing problems. Yet it is good to let you want more. I think it's so uninteresting to keep some things ambiguous and leave the audience to think that they should fill the gaps. The title should give you this. Jeff said some basic characters are based on his past relationships. That explains why they work so well. People in real life are always unusually colorful and make great characters. He moves a little away from what one might expect when he saw Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. It's one of those things where an actor takes some risk to do something he might have always wanted to do, but he couldn't. I think it is remarkable that Garlin's improv Second Background Background, and Hunt is up to it, depends on how the acting style focuses on story and direction. It is perhaps a new innovative hybrid of improves that meets India.
