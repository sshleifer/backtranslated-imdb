I enjoyed this film very much. I found it very amusing for me to feel that it captured romanticism at the turn of the century in Irish-American culture. There are no messages. There is no violence and no apparent sex, just fun in 1947, and Dennis Morgan has had the chance to sing some really good songs. A really good movie.
