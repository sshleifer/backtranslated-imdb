.. this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who is also in the film) was at the top and many politicians and even Roman churches used to closing their eyes on the brutality and evil of Nazism. Especially in the USA there were many people who did not understand what was actually happening in Germany and Europe (for example, Charles Lindenbergh). It would be like a big actor today made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac. Chaplin may have made many mistakes in his life, but this is truly a masterpiece of mankind and IMHO a great demonstration he was a brave man. The film is humorous and deep, the final speech has a terrible power and is constantly updated. I think this movie is one of the best.
