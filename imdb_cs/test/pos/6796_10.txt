ccmovieman-1, as a reviewer in the New York Times, who preferred the big brother Janis Joplin and the Holding Company album to the just released "White" Beatles album, has been called, whether bad or crazy. National Velvet is a great movie. Elizabeth Taylor's performance is fantastic, and I can't recognize a trace of accent, much less than one. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Rooney and Revere. Regarding dialogue that is hockey or sentimental, I suggest that cc have too long an irony diet and lose the ability to recognize real direct emotions and human interactions. There were times when people thought and talked that way. Not that this film has a slight hint of magical penetration through it. That's why they tell it. One might also criticize The Wizard of Oz, King Kong, Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, Black Stallion (another great horse movie) or a thousand other films for having action and dialogue, which seem richer than real life. No friend of mine, National Velvet, will hold firmly within himself, with his tongue firmly on his face. Something of today's tired filmmaker is almost impossible to recreate.
