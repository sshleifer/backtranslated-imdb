Nice movie. At the beginning I thought it was a medieve detective type of hi-fi film, but I was completely surprised by the end. I think that the whole film covers too many subjects, each of which can be the main theme, such as revenge, friendship and dream. But all of them were mixed without focusing on them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built around the end from the beginning. <br /> <br />
