This is one of the most fun movies ever made. And for those of you who don't have it, it should be funny. So often comedy tries to be so deliberately funny that it is missing, but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being cheerful in the finest ways. Even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this film. It is a comedy classic that you will certainly appreciate at another time when studios regularly do such things. kudos to the creators, and to the subtly subtle cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are supreme. Indeed, a true breakthrough performance. It will be great to see that this guy has his duty.
