Five minutes later, I began to feel that you seemed to have a totally rusty hero and his overweight. I've seen it all before, yeah. I was going to be bored for a few hours from my mind. This is something I got used to ... that we are all. Then, after a few minutes of testosterone, insults were triggered and a truck appeared. Well, the shooting techniques used to make it look fast were awkward, but who cares! The car is amazing! But soon it will be removed again and we will return to the geek and his overweight friend. But now I'm happy it won't be too bad. Then, again and again, I am amazed at the film's cleverness. There are so many jokes at their expense, it's like everyone in the world, except two. The mind behind makeup and effects was a genius I swear. Believe me, if you're a guy who's missing so many jokes in this movie, there's so much that only a girl can understand. Brother Bob is by far the best killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that he is a workbook just adds to the effect. There are of course some really bagpipe science facts here, but it's not always the case. When our 'hero' has nose bleeding and uses blood to guide Brother Bob to his death, now it is waste. There is no way that nose bleeding can be so bad and does not mean that it is a separate artery or something. I'm using too much blood, but it's a little too far. Incest's jokes are a bit predictable, yet funny. And the way Brother Bob meets his end is more than classic. Overall, this film follows the rules that it really breaks out of the overclocked melodramatic tribe of horror that we got so much in 2003-2005. The end of this movement simply couldn't be better. It is definitely necessary to follow anyone who likes their horror with several gore and attitude commands.
