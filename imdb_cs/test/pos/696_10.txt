As a teenager, I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on LOT) because of its witty, appealing-to-teenager humor. This may not be what critics consider to be 4 star observation, but I love it for what it is - a fun comedy that should please the audience. Adult actors are from my generation (probably because I love the film so much) and were like a fantasy cast of all the favorite TV shows from the early 1990s - Full House, Family Affairs, Fresh Prince - all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie 1990s. Although it may not involve high doses of nudity and violence, so many teen movie writers think vital to the success among demographic youth (or perhaps because of its absence), I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere.
