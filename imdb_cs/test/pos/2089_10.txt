Great movie. Every now and then he was a master of Toyoda and his crew. Actors give credible performances all around. The visuals are scary, beautiful and sometimes terribly beautiful shots of Japanese landscapes and urban landscapes. The sounds, courtesy of the Japanese 'Dig' bands are never too nervous as one would expect from the band. sound tracks. It's strangely atmospheric and suitable for the scenes they're on. All in all, they worked perfectlyâ€¦ Well, if they were to give justice to the story, perfection was the only thing anyone could accept. The real size of the 9 souls is a compelling story. In a prison break, the film may have lost a genre these days, and the trip's film loses its appeal due to the way the world is shrinking. But this story mixes something fresh with these two genres. 9 convicts will be given the freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their place in society. will society accept them? will they really be freed from their dark traps? and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every convict has an interesting history. Their crimes are as diverse as their apparent fates. The Brotherhood maintains a drama story between them and gives it a cheerful comedy. And given the nature of their background, violence is always something to wait for it to happen.
