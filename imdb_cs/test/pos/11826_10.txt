And I don't understand why the show gets so much. In my opinion, this show is really excellent. The first two episodes weren't so great, but they're getting a load on the third episode. Which seems to be typical of the sitcom Steve Moffat. I would rate it among the best situation comedies that Britain has ever created. The show itself is at best a farce, it's not consistent with the Fawlty Towers, but you can definitely rate it as high. Black Adder, Coupling, or The Young Ones! I'm watching the first season and all I can say is that I'm happy to buy a DVD! The problem with this show is probably and why it was so difficult, according to the Internet, that the original press release compared it with the Fawlty Towers and everyone was disappointed that it wasn't! Even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is clear your mind from all prejudices, give a show at least run into (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! The only thing I can say is thanks to Steve Moffat for writing and thanking him for having all the employees download it!
