Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to be one of the best girls in high school. Uncool and the nasty girls had two options, being a mole or prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them with their trial cheating practices. Two of the best boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes) ask them for their answers and everyone is arrested. After the headmaster (Bud Tingwell) climbed out, cool girls meet with them outside on the playground and confront them with "dobbed" on them. Both Debbie and Sue didn't have cool girls to invite to "dunnies" for smoke. They then start hanging out with them on weekends on the beach, watching all the boys surf. Sue ends up with Danny and Debbie with Garry. Lots of usual teenage events take place including sex, drugs and rock and roll. Garry has a potential heroin overdose, which Debbie faces inequalities in life and she decides to learn to surf instead of watching the boy. They're not happy, but they're watching her, calling names, and finally Debbie controls the board. Great Aussie film from the 80s.
