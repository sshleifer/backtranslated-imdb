Although the beautiful soda counter at the local pharmacy is not <br /> <br /> there is longer and the clothes are sure to be l946 instant <br /> <br /> post-war vintage, good and bad are easy to understand and <br /> These old planes are really dated, this film will never be dated. <br /> <br /> Human Adjustments and Postwar Problems, Beautiful <br /> <br /> Love Stories, Wonderful Acts (Especially Harold Russell and Dana Andrews) as of 2002 as was the case in 1946. I was one of the young women who welcomed our amazing World War II veterans' homes. Like many others, my memories of <br /> <br /> war years and home homes today are as fresh as if <br /> <br /> took place yesterday - this movie is very important for our time.
