Flipper is a nice pleasing movie for the whole family. Of course this is not a great movie, Free Willy looks much better in almost every film making component. Maybe sometimes it becomes a bit naive and writing and the script is not the best part of the movie, but it's a fun movie with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral news. Elijah Wood once again turns out to be an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can make a bad movie traceable, a good movie - good, good - a great and great movie becomes a classic of all time. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and his role is perfectly appropriate. As I said before, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best. So Flipper is the perfect way to see a nice, sweet and fun movie. If you like being sick and tired of modern Hollywood waste, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and vulgarity, you would most likely want this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
