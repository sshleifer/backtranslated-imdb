Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by then almost all of Europe had fallen under the Nazi war machine. She entered the war, Britain practically started from scratch, with limited supplies and aviation, which exceeded Germany at ten. But the will of the British was firm, encouraged by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said, "We will never go down". <br /> <br /> On 8. August 1940 was the Battle of Britain. For the first time since Hitler said he wanted to control the world, he hit the wall. Although massively outnumbered, British Royal Air Forces continued the attack, and in the span of twenty eight days in September and October 1940, the German Luftwaffe victims climbed to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five lost aircraft and crew. Hitler's anger was pernicious, but he had to call for a moment. He responded later in the year, Hitler launched a massive fire bombing of London on Christmas Eve 1940. When I say there was never a catastrophic film rivaling the real live shots of London on fire during this attack would be underestimated. Perhaps the most surrealistic effect of this chapter in "Why We Fight" series would see British citizens come out of their underground shelters after bombing raids to recover what was left of their life above the ground. While you are watching, there is no way to understand the vivid horror that these people have had to go through because the city of London has remained in a virtual ruin. However, the Nazis were also amazed and stymi. Everything Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy has now turned to his head. Instead of being weak and willing to act as a French, the British did not give up without a fight. And they fought to take the air battle to Germany and react in kind with the attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
