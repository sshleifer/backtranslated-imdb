The other main criticism of this film - that Macy suddenly looks like Jewish when he put on his glasses - is badly placed. Glasses are just a little change that is needed to make others become Jews. The scene in which she tells her boss (paraphrasing) "but know what my background is", along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that in the past he had to fight this same assumption. Glasses make him look Jewish enough to "confirm" the existing suspicions of his neighbors and co-workers. Then there is the big nose of the new woman and the appetite for loud clothes that OF COURSE means she is a Jewess. The whole point of the film is how these little stereotypical notes become the basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp, he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes drugs. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and is lightweight to build, he must be Jewish. All these statements are equally credible to me. If the conclusions people had made to Focus were reasonable, the whole story would be lost.
