Frogs who wanted a king or a frog is Ladislaw Starewics's most horrible story about people who want the government to solve their problems I've ever seen. Ironically, he prays to Jupiter God for their answers. Jupiter first responds by sending a stump and then stork. Neither work nor stork are particularly dangerous for amphibians! Frogs have some human qualities when we see them dressing themselves in the latest fashion days and seeing some photos or using a movie camera when the stork comes! As I said, this short is a very political allegory more suitable for adults than children. In fact, I first saw it at Rhino VHS, where Bambi met Godzilla. That alone should tell you what to expect here!
