Based on the real events of 1905, the silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship, on the basis of which ugly conditions lead to rebellion. Shocked by the conditions of the ship, the citizens of the port city of Odessa rallyed to support the rebels - and consequently find themselves at the mercy of imperial forces who attack civilian supporters with fierce force. POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the bands and crowds they are members of, and achieve incredible power by showing the clash of groups and crowds in a series of extremely visualized and edited sequences. It is surprising that each of these sequences was able to stand on top of the previous film, and the film is in fact striving for strength as it ranges from rebellion to civil rally to the Odessa Stage Massacre. whole film history. Filming predominantly where real events actually took place, Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary because it builds - not just from succession to succession, but from moment to moment in every sequence - some of the most memorable images ever made. <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a great movie is something that is underestimated. It is absolutely necessary, absolutely necessary, that anyone who is seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema on his most brilliant, often imitated, seldom balanced, never appreciates.
