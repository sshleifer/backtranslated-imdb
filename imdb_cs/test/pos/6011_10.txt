Swift's writing has much more to do with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy-adventurous writers, so it's strange that Gulliver's travels were considered a children's novel. Lucky kiddies! The same goes for this movie. There have been some really terrible versions of this story that must be the reason people are reluctant to look at this version. It's a TV movie and comes from Jim Henson's muppetteer, so how should we expect anything but cuteness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the strangest places. Kids love this movie enough to sit in all three hours, but it also takes time to get Swift's dark vision right. I hate special effects, but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of dazzling us. Please note that manufacturers have faced recruitment of classic actors such as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their eccentric roles with perfection. Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is moving and touching, as well as funny (he's a little girl but twenty times his size). The framework story has a theme about absent fathers with which many children will be concerned. And the section on Gulliver's asylum introduces an element of horror that deals with the abuse of authority (apparently derived from Vallam's "Bedlam" [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> VHS always turns around in the shop for a few cents, an insult to many great artists who put this thing together. I encourage viewers to recognize the good thing by inspiring others to watch it. Although it has a lot to offer to children, adults find themselves well off to classics like Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious fantastic works.
