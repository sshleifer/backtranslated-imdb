In a minute to pray, the other to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate outlaw with a ten thousand dollar reward per head and degenerative epilepsy. Realizing your days as an outlaw are numbered wanting to desperately (though somewhat reluctantly) use the amnesty provided by the rude and drum territorial governor Robert Ryan (excellent) who wants McCord to give up his travels and received an amnesty as an example to others, while in a bandit hub Escondito, Outlaw Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to stop it. In the lead role is Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and killed other famous European faces. (American) spy Western pioneer Albert Band, also responsible for pre-Leone film Gunfight At Red Sands. Although the main character's solution is "epilepsy" is being picked up right from the Howard Hawks' El Dorado, the script is solid, quite fresh and unpretentious to us. This has a great balance between action and story, and Alex Cord is great about it. He really should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> To defend the shorter (well-nicknamed) English version: I am personally behind this age, where the longer version is always the better version and the end where McCord is ironically shot by the hateful hunters for the reward is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroyed the message of the film about hope and redemption. Call me old-fashioned, but I took root in McCord and felt that he had earned it a happy ending!
