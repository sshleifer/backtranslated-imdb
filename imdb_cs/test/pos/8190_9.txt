Based on this event, this epic is set in 221 B.C and tells the true story of China's unification. The action packed and filled with intrigue, passion, betrayal and unforgettable battle sequences took me over its entire length of 160 minutes. King Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming his first emperor. His mistress, Lady Zhao, played the beautiful actress Gong Li, conspiring to travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to prepare a fake assassination in motion that will give the king an apology to invade Yan. However, she falls in love with the killer, while the king becomes more and more ruthless. There are subplots, and tragedy and constant high drama. There are scenes of great beauty and cruelty. There is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space. Deep Characterization Thinking About Shakespeare. And the tragic events that evoke the mind of the Greek drama. And yet it is absolutely Chinese because it deals with old questions about whether the goals justify the means. It raises questions about life and death and good and evil, and all the blurred edges between them. It's a story of individuals on the background of history, a history that has shaped China in the past. two thousand years. I was confused in the story as well as the moral issues raised. There are no simple answers, which was one of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and gore. <br /> <br />
