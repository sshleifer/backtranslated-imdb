I turned 13 when Elvis hit big times in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly entered to give the king some competition. One of Buddy's main talents, besides his unique singing style and his songwriting ability, is often downplayed. Buddy was also a qualified guitarist who created a unique rockabilly style on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey is trying to capture this aspect of Buddy's personality. There have been other contemporary masters of guitarists of the same caliber, such as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. As others have pointed out, Busey is the driving force behind "The Story of Holly's Story." Not only does the script play with the facts of Buddy's life, but even a few anachronisms for two years of Buddy's popularity, basically 1957-1959. The mind that comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria watch a 3D movie. Buddy is disillusioned by this and tells Mary that it never lasts. It's just a fad. In fact, no 3D movies were in circulation at that time. The flourishing 3-D was in the early fifties. The 1955 fad had already faded. One more example where little research would be enough to make the story more believable. Sometimes it's hard to separate what really happened from urban legends around Buddy's career. The story of how the Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly did not happen as stated in the film. Another film problem is how Buddy's parents are portrayed. Buddy's parents certainly supported his musical career. "Perhaps a child" is credited to Buddy's mother, and she had an entrance to writing a song. It's good that Buddy's biggest hits have been used in the movie, but I miss hearing one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love." I am proud that, as a result of this film, Buddy's music was re-released for the next generation. His legacy is one of the best of the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave, Buddy, go on.
