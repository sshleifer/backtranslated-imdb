Remember, it came out before the Gulf War I, which gave us the "Darkness Lessons" of Werner Herzog. Le Dernier's fight is not "Sci Fi". It's more of a court. I watched it at least ten times. It is indeed a suitable companion to Herzog's "Lesson of Darkness": "And at that time, people will seek death, but they will not find it, because death will flee." . But back to the fight with Le Dernier, make sure you're looking over the last second of the movie. I wouldn't say "a surprising end", but it's something you'll miss if you just think the end will be nothing more than what you've already seen.
