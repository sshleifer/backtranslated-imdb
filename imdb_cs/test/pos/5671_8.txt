I found this movie rather brilliant. Initially, I wanted "when animals attacked" to step on the lines of "frankenfish" or even "rogues", but they were given a really terrible suffering that was not free of humanity. It was to areas where it was done (including the croc farm at the beginning of the movie, even sharing the same guide!) Added to the Fear Factor. Those crocsi are really everywhere, although I don't think they had the "attitude" of this beast. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they contributed more by distraction from the whole atmosphere. I really cared about the characters and shuddered and thought about "what would I do?" in their ship. He didn't know where your enemy was lurking, or the sound of crocodile mowing at night was really scary. I would say this film is one of the best horrors I've seen in years (approaching descent). I'll give her four handbags.
