I thought the story got into place very well. I liked this movie very much. If you're going to plunder Bridget Fonda, you can just knead. I thought shaking movie stars was a bad idea. Obviously someone doesn't think so. I'd rather enjoy the movie. I'm thinking of buying it. I want it to be my first DVD for my room. I like it so much. I'd rather not start an online argument with someone I don't know and it was through the movie. If anyone could kindly withdraw what they said about the storyline, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. However, if they feel I am not worthy to pull, I might just feel they are not worthy of either. But I cannot manage their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they don't have to pull in, but I'd appreciate it.
