Big names in the film tried to do their part for the war effort and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propaganda image is part of his contribution, although the war was almost at the end of his release. Hiker goes to war, humorously performs acts of heroism and kicks Kaiser in the ass. It's a very funny movie, though I don't think it's almost one of its best. It's with 'Dog Life' as his better output for First National than he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid'. They are his first three-reelers, which contain permanent, more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his two-shorts reels at Mutual. It may be difficult to even out a pro-war report with a grotesque on the front appearing antique and burlesque scenes, but no one would have thought it would be looking at the shoulders. In many ways, a "more serious" dramatic work with a similar message like Griffith's heart is also more beneficial. Chaplin became a true film comedy virtuoso at this time; it looks effortless. Now he knew very well that a film with fewer gags - with more sophistication, sophistication, and careful timing - could be better than any knockout, Keystone type farce with a dozen pratfalls per minute. An example in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a good example. Even when the war rages, Chaplin can lift millions of ghosts.
