"Dead Man Walking" is a film not about the death penalty, but about people involved in the death penalty - a murderer, families whose children were killed, a nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. It tells a story with little fanfare, but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch (not often, it's never easy to watch the movie) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. Revealing that it could be documentary, so convincing that you can't break your eyes, so subtle and yet so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing less than a masterpiece. It doesn't matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or you have no opinion), this film will certainly reflect on your problems. It requires a courageous screenwriter and director to look at this material in the face without swaying, and anyone involved in the film pulls it away - there is no single scene that falsely rings. A masterful movie, but don't expect it to be seen ... the final scenes might be more graphic than you can imagine, even if no blood or violence is shown. You get into this movie and become a participant, and there's a character for everyone to identify with. 10/10.
