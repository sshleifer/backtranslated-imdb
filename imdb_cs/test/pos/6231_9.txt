I really liked it. I know it's uncontrollable with what's now clich√©, and a lot of excessive training, but it was a hell of a lot of fun. In our 70's and 80's horror cheese search we come across many Flicks that are so bad they're good. We also have some that are so good to suck, and then we have some that are so bad they're just bad. That's so bad that it's good. Some teenagers have come across an "oasis" in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten piece of travel around America and decide to "check it out". They cross every line of unsuitable ones until they are absurd and pay for it. They pay dearly. I'd normally not give a movie like this 9, but the girls in this one is the type we're missing in 1970: ditzy, scantily-clad and fit. It is not anorexic breadth of today's horrible horror; look amazing in root shorts. I'll give her 9 out of 10 kids.
