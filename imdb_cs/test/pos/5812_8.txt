That was my first look at this short-lived British television horror series, but I saw a couple of Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and I thought they were enough. Br /> <br /> This first episode was a shock - not for horror, but for all nudity. Was this "normal" television in England in 1980? If so, she showed much more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their boobs, one scene where the guy put his hand on one, and another scene with a man's top woman pretending to have sexual intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining. The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the 17th century returns to her old house and makes life for a married man difficult. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter", was not much of an actor, but his wife was not bad and it was really beauty. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary". Her husband rightly suspected her having an affair and playing a part in this story. Patricia Quinn was funny as the witch laughs "Lucinda Jessup", who returns with an average wave of her and has a good time torturing the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man I would say that it was a special fun to see two women go for it! It starts slowly, but once "Lucinda" starts to stir things up, it's very fun.
