The boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens, accepts, much to his horror, the Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the post office. I recently watched it in a class where several students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Mauritius Richard and the rivalry in Toronto / Montreal. Highly fun, fun and accurate.
