You have seen the last episode 32 (although it says only 30 episodes were made) and I have to say that this series was really very good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime / police stories . Probably all 32 were based on the fact with the information at the end of each episode of criminal penalties imposed on the perpetrators, which was sometimes bold, well-behaved, believable, and dare to say, a fun series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to dissolve the unit was almost unbelievable because it did so well and at least in the series it was never able to "get its man"! It's certain 10/10 for me.
