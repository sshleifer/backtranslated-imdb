I had to get the movie because it didn't come where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth a wait. I fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you saw because they worked together on Harry Potter movies. The woman who plays her pernicious, righteous mother really convinced me well and how much of that hypocrite is, I think she did. great work plays a role. I just wish we could see what the sex scene is. LOL, but of course we need to use our imagination about how it went down. (snickers) I absolutely thought the movie was worth a wait and if you wanted to watch a good movie. Rent this movie. I have to say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see him doing films outside Harry Potter, even though I love him as Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope that Rupert will act outside Harry Potter to expand his skills!
