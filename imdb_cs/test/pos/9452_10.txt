I rented this movie last night from a video store. The rent was new and was not issued long ago, but the rent was only overnight. I, my little sis, and my older brother, who usually hates watching these movies, sat down and watched. As soon as the movie started and after he sat there, we watched him for a moment and we all laughed historically. Even my brother. This movie is funny, I actually laughed. No matter how fun some movies are ... even though I think their fun sometimes I can't laugh. But the movie ... I laughed. My brother said he was the best "kind of movie" he saw. Finally, I watched the movie 2 or 3 hours later.
