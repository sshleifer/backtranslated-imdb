Be Prepared for a Trip to Haneke's "La pianiste" ... The psychological illness of the main character, beautifully played by Huppert, goes beyond any limit you can expect. The most amazing part is that you start to feel compassion for Erika. Trash-sexuality (no scene boredom though), perversion, masochism, incestuous relationships ... Haneke gives us rough food, hard to digest; The only way to escape the extremism of some scenes is sometimes to start laughing. "Mise en sc√®ne" may not be the most interesting part of the movie, it has obvious austro-germanic, sometimes Scandinavian notes: static, long scenes, but never boring. Vienna setting, the French language to make the whole look like a European blend. Permanent German music Background (Schubert) is beautifully selected. Above all, both awards for the best actors in Cannes are well-deserved: one of the greatest performances of the year by one of the greatest French actresses ever.
