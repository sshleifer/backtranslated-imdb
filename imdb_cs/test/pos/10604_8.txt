For the first time I saw this movie in a video store and as a Bam Marger fan I had to rent it to see what it all was about. Because I have a huge and stupid (note word stupid) sense of humor, I found this movie absolutely cheerful. Some parts are senseless and random, but it is so fun. You'll have to think of things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on your head with melon are funny to appreciate this movie. I was really impressed. I was also surprised by acting. These people did a good job. Nothing Oscar is worthy, but good enough to get through the amateur level. Adults and young adults would probably find it more enjoyable because of modern slang and situations. I wouldn't recommend watching it with my parents and vice versa. All in all, acting was great, the screenplay was fun, and the story is really something you can relate to.
