A surprisingly good and fast-humorous adventure that features Kelsey Grammer (reportedly in his first leading role in office) as an unconventional navy commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he earns it by competing against the US Navy in a series of war games with a crew of untested, dubious and loving men (and also a woman). Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and positive comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do pretty well. Secondly, in addition to Grammer's character, most crew members provide a little or a lot of movie humor to be treated as a double-edged sword. Three members of the support cast - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes that include weird gestures, personality and their personalities. "Down Periscope" is more than a version of the Navy "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the film does is that work has done the right thing and I like it.
