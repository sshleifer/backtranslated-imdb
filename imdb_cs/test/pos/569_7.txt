This is a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black boy who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and a subsequent court case that follows. What this movie shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can be to condemn an ​​innocent man and how senile an old fool thinks one black man looks very much like the other, and when he rotes him when he was rotting in prison, he said he was the man who murdered my wife. The star is an advocate who is brilliant not only in court, but also in what the police should do all the time. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10.
