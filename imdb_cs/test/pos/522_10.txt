I like to see Linda Blair in a real "horror" movie. I was disappointed with her in most of everything because of "Exorcist" movies (which I loved). What was wrong with all the ugly "B-movies" she did? David Hassellhoff, on the other hand, all I could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror actor. David must stick to "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> It's a great movie all around. Even in the 1980s it was an amazing movie. He has horror, action and drama. It's tense and I loved Linda Blair.
