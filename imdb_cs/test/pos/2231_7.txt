There is a good run bit about the price tag of silk negligee. Bimbo at the office shows a contract she received for $ 22 (close-up of the mark). Later, Mary Astor finds a brand in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). A little later, Mary Astor is going to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looking at the HER silk negligee price tag ($ 14) and recalling how disgusted she was about bimbo, as well as the fact that she spent $ 8 less than the "most obvious" woman she has ever met. Sounds obvious, but it was good. The film would be stronger if a stronger actor played Robert Ames' character (he is too low a key for a self-service vendor and spends most of the film with his face away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortez was given more than an ironic smile. Both men's leashes are bland and forgotten and prevent them from pancake masculine make-up so popular in the era of this film. But Mary Astor's character is interesting, attractive and believable. Behind closed doors it is worth seeing.
