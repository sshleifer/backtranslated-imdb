There are many well-known Hitchcock elements (previous and later films) and this time mix into merry, but barely thrilling entertainment. You can say that Dorothy Parker had her hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the Cummings' dialogues with a blind man and his encounter with a somewhat bizarre group of circus people. The glorious climax of the Statue of Liberty seems a bit cumbersome - judged by today's standards, but also compared to other Hitch Monument finals (eg Blackmail, North by Northwest).
