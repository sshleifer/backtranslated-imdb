Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variation on John Huston's semifinal, the Assisted Film Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi (1955) devotes a little more attention to the robbery in detail. Also, the police are not involved in the aftermath of the Rififi robbery as well as in the Asphalt Jungle. In the end Rififi (1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than the asphalt jungle (1950). The remarkable Noir painting that defines a French cinema from the 1950s. Unbreakable Hollywood Blacklist. The first film in five years for Jules Dassin, who was the victim of McCarthy's communist hunt in the late 1940s until the early 1950s. He was rewarded when Rififi (1955) became successful in France and Europe. So defy the poisonous Hollywood blacklist in the main road that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career, not only restoring his name, but also giving him a second chance at filming. Jules Dassin gave the film world and its ever-growing audience a masterpiece of influential proportions. His material handling is exceptional and the direction of the actors is flawless. It creates tense situations with precise processing. Dassin came across the circle in the film Noir Genre by directing his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). The end of Dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in making Noir's films. Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty films for director Jules Dassin. Masterpiece in acting, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. It's not a movie that would leave your place for one minute because there's always something unforgettable. As brilliant as anything Jean Pierre Melville, who was the master of this type of film. Masterpieces like Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to probably billions of films made in film history. One of the fascinating aspects of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes most of the 118 minutes. The main characters plan and implement the jewel robbery in the same way that a film director prepares for pre-production, production and film post-production. It shows how difficult it is for a gem robbery like in Rififi (1955) to commit, and why very little would do that. The fact that the scene barely contains a mess, as in other films with indifference, turns this scene into something bigger. Close to how one can get to have a perfect sequence in the movie. The lack of unnatural sound in the orientation thist heist sequence is built into the realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue or music would destroy any tension and tension the director is trying to create. Using natural sound, the heist sequence is a beneficial viewing experience. Filmmakers and producers would now use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of the lack of confidence in the main movie's patience. It maintains a level of consistency that never fails once. Maintaining a high level of tension is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection. The director achieves tensions in a succession of robberies that rarely match most heist film robbery scenes. Jean Servais and other major actors are contributing to tensions with low key action. Getting tense into a scene is a task that is few capable. Sequence magnifier Rififi (1955) reaches the Hitchcockian voltage and voltage levels. Many filmmakers from Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced if they were not inspired. One filmmaker influenced was Jean Pierre Melville (the original choice for director of Rififi) who used succession variations of heist in Le Doulos (1961), and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another filmmaker influenced was Stanley Kubrick who made a similarly themed film in Killing (1956). Also Quentin Tarantino, whose debut feature film, Reservoir Dogs (1992), was inspired by this film. Other film directors influenced John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is in many ways comparable to Bob Flambeur (1955). One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville conducted groundbreaking films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Two, each film includes an aging criminal who plans and performs a brave robbery. Three, Bob le Flambeur and Rififi end up in fatalistic fashion. Four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify two as movie greats. The Rififi spell features colorful characters that surround a story like Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most violence is implicit, yet brutal. The main characters, led by Tony le Stephanois, follow a strong outdated code of honor that reminds Sam Peckinp and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes Tony le Stephanois with his cynical look and tired look. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became my favorite when I saw him on the big screen from start to finish.
