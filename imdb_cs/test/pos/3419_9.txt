Where these films differ from traditional Hollywood movies, it is that it shows the true depth of feelings. For example, in Europe we had years of war, and although one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies at the end of the conflict always ended up living side by side or each other. In the US, white population immigrants exterminated the indigenous population to almost extinction. An American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This, in my opinion, often simplifies the nature of Hollywood film when trying to explain a foreign country's dispute. In this film, however, the director and script did not fall into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in the story has some truth and something wrong. it is a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
