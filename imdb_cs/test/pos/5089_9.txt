Nothing about this film, which is held together by fully realized characters with a certain depth. Even hooded torturers have body language. Jannings' performance is brilliant, all will, desire and need. Henry VIII, how he had to be. Henny Porten may be more noble and clearer than Anne Boleyn, but she plays a role as it is written: The victim caught in the jaws of a big (huge) child. Sparkuh's cinematography is beautiful in restoration, sensual shades. Lubitsch lets these characters breathe and reveal their corruption to the smallest senses. He takes the time to try the patience of the viewer to take the action, but time is worth it. Slow your pulse and watch this smaller miracle of German silent film.
