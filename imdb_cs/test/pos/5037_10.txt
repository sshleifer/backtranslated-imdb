John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the movie of the same name. I don't think it could be a better view. The film was funny but touching. Michael is a very "human angel" (if any). Andie MacDowell is excellent in her role as a reporter because she goes from infidelity to faith. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are brilliant as fellow reporters, each of whom is trying to prove a scam on the ground. Each of the auxiliary games is amazing, especially an older woman (her unknown name) who plays Michael's mother! One of the cutest movies I've seen in years ... I could watch this movie several times!
