Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about Nanny, a woman who gives everyone the help of those in need. It's called the boy who married Nanny when his mother is not on the job. <br /> <br /> I have three main reasons to respect this movie: 1) It's a touch, but not happy. It's called in a very real way, without a lot of Hollywood's aggravating luggage. And the end is pretty good (teary, but not over-the-top). 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film set in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna in New York, it does not wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. The story is based on the strength of the characters and dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. It's not preaching, it's just good. 3) Has a great soundtrack (can't beat old R&B school and Chicago blues). In general, acting is strong, but not universally. Some performances simply do not keep the characters that the actors have to portray. But since it was a movie made for television, it can be expected. 8 out of 10. An imperfect but likable, good movie on a rainy day.
