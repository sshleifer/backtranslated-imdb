K-Pax is a very interesting movie. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) a real alien, or is he a man who thinks he's an alien? That's the question Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) answers before the announced deadline Prot prepares for his departure from Earth. As the film unfolds and more evidence is revealed, both theories grow credibility. His ability to map from the memory of the galaxy's area where his home planet is located suggests that no man could have. However, the hypnotic seance leads us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could cause such personality aberration. The end seems to give an answer, but it is ambiguous enough to wonder if you really know. I normally don't like lady or tiger ends, but this is irritating. I have my own theory that suits all leashes, but I don't know that my theory is a little more accurate than anyone else. Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") spins the story gently, with great skill. This is a rare example of a director who has stayed in the shade and has produced outstanding performances from talented actors to let the story dominate. This does not mean that directing is technically worse because it is excellent. However, Softley remains unobtrusive, delivers great power with subtlety, a pleasant change from today's top directors who visually catch and shake the audience as if to shout: "See how great I am!" Kevin Spacey again brings amazing performance like Prot. This is a part that is extremely challenging, requiring Spacey to make a cool and logical one minute, and then switches the device to conjure up his tortured alter ego under the next hypnosis. The universe is as believable as a stranger and a man, making the viewer a more difficult task. Jeff Bridges is also amazing as a relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. This is inspired by the narration for a thoughtful viewer. I rated it 9/10. If you have to have a closing at the end of the movie, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you like the fascinating secret that keeps you thinking long after credits, you won't be disappointed.
