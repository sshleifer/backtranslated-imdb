It is an exceptional film musically. I felt terrible that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I had a chance to see her live. To know that she showed an amazing Lincoln Ctr. 1991 concert & that I could be there, but it wasn't painful for words. I just bought my first record of Amalia. While the music recording is fantastic, it is able to see her face in this film and its great expressiveness and passion when singing these terrible sadness songs is amazing. Something like seeing Mary holding Piet in her arms. I watched her on the film and reminded me that I witnessed a similar extraordinary concert performance by Mercedes Sosa in Lincoln Ctr in the mid-1990s. When I sat listening to Mercedes, I felt that I was in the presence of a vast spiritual and musical power that contained amazing primordial power. Some of the "Amalie" music segments touch, such as Caetano Veloso, who pays tribute to Amalia and sings one of his solo songs in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international reach of her musical repertoire and the ties she has created. fans around the world. There is one segment claiming to have played in every single city in Italy that has a podium! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her struggle w. mouth cancer and how she came to New York to commit suicide in a hotel. However, while watching Fred Astaire's movie videos, she gradually became convinced that life was worth living and turned away from. Amazing! Later in the film, she bravely and directly confesses to the interviewer that although she could conquer the world musically, her personal life was one of pure sorrow. She admits she was never happy. This is excruciatingly sad to hear, but perfectly fine. singer immersed in fado (which translates as "bad fate" or "bad luck") tradition. She also longs to hear more about her personal life: what made her so sad? what was her disappointment? <br /> <br /> "Art of Amalia" is a bit disappointing in other major areas. My quibbles: show 20-30 full songs in the movie, but only provide an English translation for the last one is a waste (unless the movie was intended only for a Portuguese-speaking audience that I can't imagine). To see the deep pain on her face when she sings and doesn't understand the lyrics, it's unwanted. As for the other minuses, there is hardly any biographical material about Amali's family background. There is one 20 sec. fragment w. her singing w. her mother (it's pretty big). There is one short reference to her parents moving fr. to Lisbon. I'd like to see movie shots from the village she came from. Interviews such as those are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (and a few close friends). It's a good, but not a big subject. There are no conversations that are experts on fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we have no deep understanding of its musical roots. In short, it is an amazing movie that anyone who is interested in Amalia has to see. But it's not perfect or definitive work on this topic.
