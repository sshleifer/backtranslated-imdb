Many experienced and excellent actors on the Eastern Front mingled in an ongoing plot of unprecedented part of World War II. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. One episode will leave you and wish you another. Pay attention to the final credits where thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are shown. An unpleasant story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogue. Made with excellent kits and camera. Heroes and criminals, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people trying to survive and overcome the most horrible time. I want to get a copy for my own collection so I can enjoy it repeatedly.
