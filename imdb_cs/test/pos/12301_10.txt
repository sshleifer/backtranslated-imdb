This is perhaps the most beautiful movie I've ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. It is self-confident and of its kind, so it makes no sense to say that it is better or worse than other great movies, just that it can become itself a perfect work of art. And it was fun to watch the confused horror fans get up and walk out!
