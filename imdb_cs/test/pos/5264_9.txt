This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One of them is a manager who reassesses life based on the expectations of her death in one year. The second is a playboy who is tired of gold-digging young women and is looking for a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, microwave popcorn, curl up your honey, and prepare for a gift.
