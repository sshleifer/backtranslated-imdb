I've never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and I don't understand why. For something that was "rushed in ten days", it all surprisingly turns out well. While it is true that "Becky Sharp" is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins better Becky, there's nothing that would stop you from getting a solid 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy may seem too cute and pretty to play an absolute bitch, but at other times she just has to narrow her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The transition to a more modern environment was not against "Vanity Fair," and the only thing that really causes conflict is casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was under 5 feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall - all of them gathered to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman. "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. And you know she deserves her coming, and then some, but you're still apologizing when she gets her. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending that is interesting to see because most of the remnants of the movies were almost identical. For the pleasure of pleasure, the end of "Becky Sharp" is finally more fun, though aesthetically, and out of the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the better, whether you like it or not. it.
