Based on the successful paperbacks of John Jake "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", it was a mini series on television from 1985 to 1987. success "Roots" for success. a similar era of civil war / slave soap opera was broadcast a decade earlier in the 1970s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he made many films like Dirty Dancing that made him famous, plays as Orry Main, a young man from South Carolina who is born on plantations. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is to be a hated enemy, Yankee North, but with whom he binds closely. Soon, Mains from the South and Hazards from the North become friends over a turbulent era leading to a civil war. The theme of family, friendship, and the right thing to do, even when the nation is falling apart, is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray nurses who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell. Garber's biting, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is fun on screen. what we see is all we see in Jakes' novels, what we see is its condensed version and changed a few things to make it a historical romance with attached historical lessons, the characters found in all the major civil war scenes - Harper's Ferry where the abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the former slave of Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox, and we are dedicated to the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) the war in his conscience, we meet all the major players, including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis, several veteran holly Woody Actors from the Golden Era - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha villand have portraits and it's interesting to see them. This is not a historical fact, it is a historical FICTION and pure dramatic entertainment. But there is the end of the cliff and beautiful cinematography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie that runs longer than Gone With The Wind with the war scenes in it! The script can sometimes be bad, and acting may not be the best, despite the good cast. Swayze Ham does just like Terri Garber, but some performances like Kirstie Alley, James Read (like George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as beautiful and powerful Madeline are really good performances. They shot in orchards and southern locations. The music is glamorous and it feels good to the movie in which we are the root for good guys and watch the villains system and finally get their comeuppance. This should be followed by all fans of the Civil War films and the novels by Jakes. It is available on DVD and VHS.
