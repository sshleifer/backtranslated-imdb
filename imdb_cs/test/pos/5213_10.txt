The only reason I decided to see this movie is thanks to the great actors Karen Sillas (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money", "99", who is deeply engaged in Gary Cole, (Dave), "Cry Wolf", '05 who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop saying LIES. Alyson and Dave try to rebuild the old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions. The relationship is unpleasant and Alyson decides to find out what's going on and the plot is very mysterious. If you're a big fan of Karen Sillas, it's a movie for you. I just want Karen to appear in more movies, I miss her great talent.
