Critics and viewers have seen this movie, but in fact I didn't think it was bad! Even critics usually agree with the idea that this is stupid, and I normally despise PG-13 "horror movies". So that means one of two things: either (1) I am too pleased, and my tastes in movies have diminished over the years, or (2) "When the aliens' call is almost as terrible as it is to be. To be righteous, some of the film's criticisms are true - story development isn't much, and there's not much going on in the story. But man alive people, how much did you expect from a babysitter? Cut them some freedom! As a former guard watching this swing late at night with lights out, I can safely say that the stalker dude was one scary mofo! Who knows? I think that willies will give me something like that. Yes, I admit I was having fun watching it, and I don't care how big a minority puts me in;)
