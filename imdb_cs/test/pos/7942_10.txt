Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant piece of film propaganda. Russia's people are threatened by two major enemies, the Mongols and the German Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite the fighting, rival princes in the Russian Empire, Nevsky takes charge and fights the lesser of two evil (Teutonics). This influential film has been copied many times and still holds today. The soundtrack of the composer Prokiev and Eisentstein's direction is the look and sound we look at. Many years later, John Milius used many film scenes, set pieces and costumes from this film and incorporated them into Conan. of my favorite Conan lines was taken from this movie. "It's not the power of iron in the gun, but it depends on the power of the man who controls it." The comparisons are unmistakable. The armor that James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights wear is virtually identical. Real tribute paid from one director to another. I give Alexander Nevski one of my highest recommendations. The film plays as the last act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is really amazing.
