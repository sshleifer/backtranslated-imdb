The BBC and HBO have teamed up to create a "Dirty War", a 90-minute television movie about a "dirty bomb" terrorist attack in London. The film quickly enters the store because it packs both terrorist and government counter-terrorism efforts into the film and leaves little room for human interest. On the terrorist side, we are watching the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials into the assembly to the explosion. On the government side we see PR and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, prohibition, response to detonation and follow-up. The film also makes sense of how terrorist cells such as Al-Qaeda, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies are organized. Some sort of anatomy of the "dirty bomb" incident, "dirty war" will answer many questions lurking in the minds of the public increasingly aware of this insidious threat. (B)
