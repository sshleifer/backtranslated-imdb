I saw this performance on TV and recorded. My daughter played it over and over again. I borrowed at work and everyone loved it. It's just a great physical comedy. Bill appeared here in California (worked and lived in New York) and performed on stage. I was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this great performance. Bill got a Federal grant and my daughter wrote him a greeting card and Bill was kind enough to write her a letter. note back and attach a photo. People ask me and I can't decide whether he's a comedian or an actor or a clown. Actually, they're all three. I really wish it was on DVD, my tape is lost.
