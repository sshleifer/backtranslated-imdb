"Thinking like a dinosaur" was a well-made and realized series of Olimimits. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressive and convincingly protagonist role. You can actually identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do with the girl he fell for (because he was alone and disappointed for two years and feels hopeless until "Kamala" attacks his shy life. and let her know that it would be all right, which ends up deceiving both of them, so something bad happens and she (the prototype) returns ... and her (clone) is sent to another population planet, though -Dino - and "Micheal" won't find it when it's up to Michael to decide to either kill her or let her live. But what happened to him before he met her (Kamala) was very much connected With what happened to his wife, his wife similarly died, indicating the irregularity and sorrow of most of them. .. about what should be done and you are stuck with 50/50 of what is right from wr Therefore, the "equilibrium" equation is only no one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Very dop we learn to watch this show.
