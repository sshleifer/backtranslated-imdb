This is really one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. I am not one who would stand up and cheer during the film, but this is definitely worth it. Of course, the assumption is that there is a bed that eats people well ... she is a subjective term I think it really excludes acid bubbles to suck the victim into herself and dissolves them in his sour goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. A typical family man actually started his career with this film ... and afro. There's a lot of nudity in this movie, so of course not for kids, but it shouldn't deter anyone from seeing this movie. It's my belief that everyone needs a little deadly bed in their life at some point or another, it's best if you marry it sooner than later.
