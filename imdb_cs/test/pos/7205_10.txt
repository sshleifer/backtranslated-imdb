It's hard to make a comic movie. Making a good movie about Comic is very hard to do. Making a good movie about Asterix and Obelix was done. This film shows that French know how to do: a) funny, b) cheerful, c) beautiful, d) excellent movie. Acting is no less than excellent, the whole movie's sunny feeling is perfect .. YOU MUST SEE! It must be just the funniest thing we can get out of because we've started a new millennium. 10/10
