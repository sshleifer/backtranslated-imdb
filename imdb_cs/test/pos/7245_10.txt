I waited for ages to comment on this program, and I felt it was time to do justice. This is one of Christie's darker, more sinister and engaging works, not just someone who is killed for money, it's a dark and thoroughly fairy tale story about mystery, intrigue, love and murder, which is made a little better by the adapter. The level of the game is absolutely great, Joan Hickson is noble in this game, as always! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, perform beautifully, but in my opinion the show is stolen by Margaret Tyzack, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is simply magical, acting as well as it is, freezing, moving and absolutely brilliant. Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm really looking forward to a remake to see how well Geraldine McEwan is. Watch and enjoy.
