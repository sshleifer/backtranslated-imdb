I was surprised that I liked the movie. But it reminded me of the first fifth 13th version. There were several kitschy elements, but there were many great elements. The story was good - predictable if you saw more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-row movies to make it worth it. There are some unforgettable scenes worth watching. The few questions I had with the story were about the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene the scarecrows (who were people on stilts whose blood was released to grow crops) looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks. There were more than a few gaps in the conspiracy and acting was average, but at least it sounded like real people talking, unlike Hollywood movies, where dialogue is really fake when you think about it. The climax of the last scene when the main character says, "I'm not Baker, I'm Connell!" A lops head from a scarecrow is satisfying as his friends were largely killed by these creatures at this point.
