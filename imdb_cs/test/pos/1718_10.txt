As an old doctor fan Who, and after the average Fox movie, I was doubtful about this new series of Doctor Who. I gave him a chance, and I'm so glad I did. Yes, some episodes aren't as brilliant as the others, but they're all nice and yes, Eccleston's doctor is not far from any of us. I was in front of me, but ... Eccleston's doctor is just the best. His performance is occasionally comical, at others dramatic, sometimes completely crazy, but always fantastic. This and Bill Piper like Rose are doing this series over the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic like Rose's mom). ), and there is a depth of this series that has not yet been present. This series is incredibly strong, especially with regard to its Sci-Fi. I mean, who would have thought you might ever regret, or even scream about Dalk before we had times like this with Rose's father, Emergency Doctor, and 'You were fantastic ... in the history of this series, so I'm was the final speech? I recommend anyone, whether it's a Doctor Who fan or even a TV drama to buy this set on DVD, it's really "Fantastic!". Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and we're looking forward to saying I must say that Dr. David Tennant isn't just that good, of course you disagree, but I don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments, I also have to say that in my opinion this series hasn't been as good as the last one yet, but the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem. So whether you like it or not and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, the Doctor is back and is here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "fantastic!" as a doctor!
