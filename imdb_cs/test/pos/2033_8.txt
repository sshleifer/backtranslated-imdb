I have to admit that I wasn't expecting much for this movie. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it just like I did. The script wasn't Oscar-winning material, but it wasn't even horrible. The actor was a great Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great support role and looked beautiful as always. What this film did for me was music. If you don't like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you're probably used to this movie. It's all about being a rockstar. Some clich√©s were present, but the film did not decrease at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember Stand up and Shout !!! 8 out of 10 great games and amazing music. Jason
