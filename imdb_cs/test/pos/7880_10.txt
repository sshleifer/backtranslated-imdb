I really liked the movie "JOE". It has indeed become a cult classic among certain age groups. <br /> <br /> My personal friend is the producer of this movie. It's my Stepsons father-in-law. He lives on the west side of Manhattan and has a Bungalow. in Southampton on Long Island. His son-in-law lives next to his bungalow. Currently he has no production. Mr. Gil is a real gentleman and I would like him to continue making the production of moves.
