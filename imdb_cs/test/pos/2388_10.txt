I saw the film for the second time on September 30, 2006, and I thought it was even better than when I first saw it. I really enjoyed acting, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this movie. The story of the story has definitely kept your interest and I hope this film will do it to the top. I felt that he was moving very smoothly between the scenes and it was a surprise at the end, but let's say I didn't see it. I also thought Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe" did a great job and I hope this movie will help him in his next acting career. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
