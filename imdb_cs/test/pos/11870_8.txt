Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yeah, it's hard to keep your mind out of this appealing beauty (which gives a brilliant picture of perfect performance) because my tongue just wags. "One Night at McCool's" is a demented and unpredictable black comedy with ancient shades tied to its well-known but cleverly processed and chaotic story, which has three men who yearn for one woman and eat it to her. When you see Tyler, it's no wonder why they are infatuated and do anything? This is something that sees her 'happy and alive' her 'dreams. Like Tyler, there's something somewhat intoxicating about this feature in that we see Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays a hired killer with cool-easy but dubious hairstyle) ) with their roles. The Consumer Conspiracy opens with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) who tell their story of how they came to this divine presence and the possible influences they have on them to lead to a crazy climax. There is an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would virtually tie together with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (that is seeing them leaving their reserved zone of comfort to fill this girl). Howard Zwart's direction is color zippy balancing a fast fire scenario of gags and fun frenetically, if complicated situations. One of the best radar comedies in the last decade that will take you under Tyler.
