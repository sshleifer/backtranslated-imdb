Totally disgusting and cheap crazy humor. I loved it !!! It is the most disgusting and utterly horrific feature film, with the exception of Nicolas Read, who plays the dead jester. But it is that I have laughed so many times and I have to pass it on to filmmakers, it was by no means anything special or ordinary. Rape, fighting, zombie vomiting on rape victims. What movie does it have? Not because of the grandeur, but with pizza, bong and six packs of beer, you did it if you have a cast iron stomach and a youthful sense of humor like me.
