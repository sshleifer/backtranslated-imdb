We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is pretty, friendly, often smiling, but strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister recites original poetry that is getting the community excited about sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother is happy again and the boy next door shows her interest in Evie, Evie tries to find out what she really wants to do. Evie is really. For such a brutally sincere person who doesn't mind telling Ivy-League types that he doesn't respect them, it would seem strange that she would be able to postpone a lie. For someone who is so happy and cheerful he is quite emotionless about certain issues. They are not defects of characters, they are conspiracies of development and they mean much more than they seem at first sight. Mostly it is a melodram: the lies of a character, the personality of other characters are drama, because relationships are threatened. But when it comes to writing, it's very fresh and bold. Acting helps to write very well (maybe she might be a stupid idiotic sister playing better), and it's a pleasure to watch. Direction and cinematography are not so good. . They are acceptable, and Evie's world is tinged with color and light, which for some very beautiful images, but it's not very consistent. It is not so much a mistake due to low production value, but within the same value there is an original story and real care for the characters. So even if it's not a perfect movie, it's definitely nice. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
