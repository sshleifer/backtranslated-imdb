Don't expect a classic military comedy that claims to make fun of the army and just improve the militaristic outlook. Instead deconstructs elements that make the military such a murderous machine. A kind of East German version of "Buffalo Soldiers". "NVA" works on a meta-level that sympathizes with the attempts of its heroes to escape from the military exercises as they can. It's not a loud laugh, but a long-lasting smile. Utopian, of course (you will be subjected to cruel reality on one scene), but very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Just fill in the required 10 lines: If you don't go into the army and enjoy your work.
