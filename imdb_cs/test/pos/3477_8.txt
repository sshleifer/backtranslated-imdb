In Dublin, the crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) moves to Carrigmore's residential house for the disabled, influencing the lives of the residents. Roy is able to understand Michael Connolly's incomprehensible speech (Steven Robertson), who his father's father had left in hiding for many years because of his cerebral palsy, and became close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to a Dublin apartment, and hired a wonderful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help them. Michael lives with Rory and faces a new world, finds friendship, love and freedom, and learns to survive with his own life. "Inside I'm Dancing" is an amazing story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. Steven Robertson and James McAvoy's acting is amazing and I don't see how they were nominated for an Oscar with such spectacular performances. Romola Garai also has top performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The screenplay is moving, never rude and without redemption, and Damien O'Donnell's exact direction is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian DVD title is shamefully ridiculous, giving a bad idea of ​​this excellent movie. My voice is eight. Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The Best Years of Our Lives")
