Since the last horrific movie Asterix and since we get the Swiss German version in cinemas, here I went to watch with a bit of anxiety ... Not interested because I was glad I discovered ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> The movie is humorous and modern, has good gags, good animation, fun interaction with character, good voice cast (Note: I can only speak for Swiss German!) except for Viking's daughter Abby (her name is great, despite not very inspired actress) I especially liked the character Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German. He is a young man to be built in the shape of ...). It is a very fun picture of mollycoddled, an urban teenager; but it is very likable, despite the adolescents ... XD The interaction between Astérix & Obélix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining. It shouldn't be compared to old movies because one is quite different ... Which is not surprisingly wrong. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last movie (twelve years ago), they totally fired it. However, this movie proved that it can be done just fine ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I came out of the merry theater ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
