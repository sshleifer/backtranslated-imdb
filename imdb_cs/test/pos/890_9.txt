With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Section S will forever be associated with Jason King Peter Wyngard. Most people remember him as this camp, showy and debonair womanizer cum thriller. Mold Powers Powers But That Makes a Disruption of Character: It's much more nuanced than that. Jason King is lazy (often allowing Stewart to fight all the bad guys and only the chips at the end)), he is egoistic (his recognition of people is based on whether he read his novels or not), much His detective work is speculation without the facts to support them, and he is sorry when Annabelle is right ... and she often is. It's obviously a man with a mid-life crisis and drives, but ....... Jason King is great. If Wyngarde played him purely as a lively hero, it wouldn't work, but the king often shows as a paper tiger, guided by his libido, the love of perfection and susceptibility to gratitude (and gets in the way of his detective work) at times, but he has some the best lines and postponed in television history. And by not playing it whiter than white, chemistry and interaction between the three leading figures is all the better for him. You have recently seen it on DVD and see how much Wyngarde has put into Jason King.
