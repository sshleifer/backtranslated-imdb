I saw it last week and the sketch about the cities of Korea was fun. Very tongue in the face and suitable for the political climate. After that, the writers and Spike. The part where the translator pulls the rickshaws and throws out the Korean words could only be downloaded by Spike. This is Fox's brave attempt. This is a great show and I hope it will stop. My wife and I are TIVOing on a regular basis, and even if it encounters several other programs, we're watching it now on MySpace. I hope Fox does the whole show and does it daily. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. It is on the right track with people like Bernard Abedalla. Also, Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
