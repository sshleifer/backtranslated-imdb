Lotsa, a love story of love, an unexpected actor and great fun overall. Special effects are acceptable / decent, some of the fighting are a bit clean with some interesting acrobatic moves. The overall story moves along, and is cheesy enough to make you wonder when it will become inevitable, though there is a little twist (little). The overall naivety of the film is sometimes quite whimsical. Also pretty cute chicks, what more would you like. PS. if you want to see this movie, try to rethink it in terms of the category that the movie would fall (not necessarily where it should have fallen). ie not bomb good kitsch movies!
