I love this movie and I have seen it many times. I filmed it around 1987 when it was shown on the Channel Four, but my tape is really worn out and I would like to have a new copy of it. available on video and, as far as I know, has not been repeated since the 1980s. I had no answer and it wasn't repeated. The performances are excellent. The film has everything. Its funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and totally returns you to school days. It's a very good walk and grabs you from start to finish. The shower scene is particularly terrible. Also, I can't hear the song Badge by Cream and I don't think about this movie. This film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience because it is excellent. Please re-enter channel four or release it to Video or DVD.
