Susan Sarandon is incredible for lack of a better word. In my opinion (and yes, I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses EVER and should have at least 2 oscars on her credit. That was AMAZING's performance in Lorenzo's oil (but then I think every performance is amazing) and gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was that? And when she got this oscar, she was in the industry for about 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more, especially the performance as ingenious as her portrayal of Helena Prejean's sister. But then he is again and above all an artificial Hollywood stick and does not need oscar - people know he is just as good. This film carries some very profound, provocative news, so pointless to say that it can't be taken lightly. Of course Tim Robbins can't escape here. Do you think that due to his personal feelings about the death penalty, the impression in this film would not be accurate. However, both sides of the death penalty debate are given the same weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side, which makes the testimony of his death rather heartbreaking. At the same time, you can see how he saved his victims and the constant suffering of, of course, sadly afflicted parents. One word for Tim - BRAVO. Brilliant film and, as I said, the well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar for Susan.
