I couldn't believe he was in the eyes from start to finish. Be a fan of music video directors. I'm glad to announce that the picture in this movie is charming for the eye. There are so many rich, full images that are in front of me that every time I see this film, I find something new I have never seen before. As with previous films I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, as well as former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is well used. Although characters could be developed better, action and costuming were well worth the cost of adoption. I suggest you buy this one for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.
