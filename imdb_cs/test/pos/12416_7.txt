I recently captured this movie on a Sci-Fi channel. It turned out to be quite decent when it comes to B-list horror / thrilling movies. Two boys (one naive and one loud) ** went on a trip to stop the wedding, but they have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a strange car that makes brooms produces cats and mice for them. Things are further complicated when they take a ridiculously sad hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror in this movie really works, unlike many others. Both guys are pretty nice and there are some good chase / thrilling scenes. Nice stimulation and comic timing make this movie more than just a horror / slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.
