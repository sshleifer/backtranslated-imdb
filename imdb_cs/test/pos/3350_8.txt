What can you say? This is uncut hardcore, Alice's musical! It also works with a large energy cast seemingly having fun on the handle and while one might wish for a re-mastered version, I think we're lucky to even have this video transmission. Almost pleasure. There are a few few free moments, but that might be embarrassing, and that's certainly not the case. It could have been, too, and it would have been a campsite today. No, very gentle effort that is fun, graceful and sexy enough. Good performances, especially Kristine DeBell in the lead and was non-accredited by Richard Prior as the prone Knight is vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
