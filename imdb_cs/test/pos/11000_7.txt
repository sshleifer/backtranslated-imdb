General Trelayne is a super-creature who wants to play a small game with the Enterprise crew. There seem to be a lot of extremely improbable and meaningless things, and Trelayne seems obsessed with human practices of warfare and murder. He seems to need to experience what he thinks is excitement and create a human environment (though it is a few hundred years old) in which he can play his fantasies. The environment is inconspicuously inauthentic and the crew immediately begins to find irregularities. It will soon be clear that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but very fallible. No matter how you feel about this, stick to the end of the Twilight Zone. It's well worth it. As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character has inspired a more developed and fun on-going character Q - and you can see in the construction of John DeLance this personality more than just Campbell's Trelayne shades. It's fun to compare how the four captains we've met with him have dealt so radically differently.
