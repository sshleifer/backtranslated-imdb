I remember really liking the BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think it's the best of all Batman movies (despite the amazing Christopher Nolan 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over the seriously overcrowded 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). Originally I remembered that the first BATMAN w / Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love him). But I think this movie really hits the nail on the head. The four main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all alive and unforgettable. You really find out what Batman / Bruce Wayne is about the amazing characterization of Keaton. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could steal the best honors from Keaton when his character was not destroyed by Nolan's hack movie at TDK! Danny DeVito as a penguin is disturbing, frightening, cheerful and deadly. DeVito is great and does not need a scenery that would allow great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can truly sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his difficulty to fit into ordinary society. I've never been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer to this movie, but this is definitely my favorite show. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is goofy and strange at first, then when she is converted to Catwoman, she is currently sexy and scary, total deadly sexpot! I also feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; make a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, as always, Christopher Walken! BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. The film is created from start to finish. The way Burton introduces the Penguin's Heartbreaking Backstory catches you from the start. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings of any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets a sinister tone that defines the rest of the movie. This is a modification from the original BATMAN and great! Then take care of 33 years ahead to today's Gotham and get to know the powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene we meet the humble, bullyed, subconscious secretary Selina Kyle. And it's not long after all this is an exciting introductory movie action like Batman has to fight Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun but deadly group of outcasts and circus artists. The penguin sets the plan to attack Gotham's Christmas celebration, kidnaps Shrek in chaos and forces him to help him reinvent the company. Meanwhile, Selina reveals Shreck's punishment plans, killing her by throwing her out of the office and then reviving her. <br /> <br /> Sound is intricate? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be a realistic story. He has created a world in which the viewer can accept that it can become a dark, noir world of ill-treatment, distorted outcasts who just want to accept and fit. A sure story if you ask me! The action scenes are few and are among them, but they are all exciting, fun and nails. They're not just there for the show, just like some in BATMAN. And they all make sense. The Climactic Scene with Penguin's "Army" marching to Gotham center with the zoning of Batman's Penguin's shelter and sidekick Butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Help Batman is brief, solid, heart-pounding fun! I also love Christmas, a winter setting that adds a super-dark cold feel to Burton's Batman world. I also love Burton's slow introduction of Batman's "toys" without putting them in the throat. Each "toy" is suitable for this moment in the film and we are forced to accept it for its purpose. Although it is dark, RETURNS is still a funny movie. DeVito Penguin has many fun lines. Like Walken's Shreck. Batman-Catwoman exchanges are very stimulating and humor-filled as well! Great file! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven story of the dark forces in the game in the animated world of Tim Burton.
