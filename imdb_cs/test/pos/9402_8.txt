This is a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. based on how hard it is difficult to say, it is very certain, it is based on Mark Fuhrman's book. crime in flashbacks and its aftermath, including the arrest of a suspect, about 25 years after, who was never considered a suspect at the time in the movie, Fuhram of course is very responsible for arresting and closing the case for Martha's surviving family, particularly her mother. The story of the film is according to Martha Moxley's spirit, speaking in the first person. This is a very effective device in this movie. the human face on the murder victim (if only the actress plays the part) Maggie Grace plays Martha, and I was really overwhelmed by her. There is no way to know for sure that Mark Fuhrman's motive in investigating crimes could be out of a sense of justice and maybe he really took care of that it's just him and the dollar signs of a future bestseller. Either way, it's interesting for interesting movie shows and relatively fast paced. I don't think there was a lot of useless, useless stuff in the movie, just what was needed to tell the story. things that would shed some light on driving, and one would be right. And also, someone can argue that the end was sudden and would be right again. I said, for me, I think they told the story with at least most of the necessary. Everything else would probably require miniseries.as aside, there is a miniseries called "Season in Purgatory", which came out 6 years ealier (1996) which this film has some parallels to, even if just faint.however, if you like this movie , "Then you may be interested in the" period in purgatory ". it is my belief that the "season in purgatory" is actually a fictional description of the same crime.
