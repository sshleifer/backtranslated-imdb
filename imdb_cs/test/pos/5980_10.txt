The Lars Shepitko's ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, exhaustive account of the guerrilla struggle against the Nazis in German-occupied Belarus. The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but is unusually immersed in religious symbolism. and ready to recognize the existence of less than a great Russian co-worker. The real battle is not with the Nazis hovering in the background as mere compars, but between a Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, a captured guerrilla who finds spiritual strength to not break his death. With many references to the Crucifixion, the story insists on a heroic proportion celebrating the martyr's suffering and its influence on future generations. A remarkable work.
