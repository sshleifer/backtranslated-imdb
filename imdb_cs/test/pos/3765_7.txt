It took me a while to find this movie because they don't have it on DVD yet (and my video recorder doesn't have to re-hook it up). I think that all references to drug use are too many for some people. But on Ebay I found a decent bootleg and I have to say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is only delayed. It's slapped in the veins of "Aircraft". I have to say that when I watched Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 1980s, I enjoyed more humor than I do now. But it is definitely worth seeing only what they have been able to do (ie Film Makers) to get away before the "Just Say No" hypocrites have launched their propaganda. singing ... "We're All on Drugs" hahaha It's a stupid movie and it's worth $ 10 I paid from Ebay, so I just don't think about it on a DVD to compare it to the original - that's just stupid. What are you tall?
