It is an excellent film that tackles racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances all around, but absolutely outstanding performance by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> Makes the movie that breathes and lives. His portrayal of a man who fights discrimination and violence is simply blowing his mind. His actions are both strong and gentle and subtle. Poitier, who earned an Oscar, had to wait for many years (because of his skin color) before the Academy recognized the sheer brilliance of his acting. He withdrew, was worried and realistic because he became his hallmark. He and Poitier undoubtedly contrast with the forces of cowardice, courage, and human transformation through friendship. The film is both pleasant and deeply persecuted in its depiction of racism in the United States. Ironically, it somehow reflects the reality under which Poitier had to work.
