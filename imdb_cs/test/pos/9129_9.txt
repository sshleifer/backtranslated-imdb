As in Rififi, the most convincing scene in the film is the perfect silence of the jewels. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers has their own specialized work to perform, each of them successfully combining their own unique talent to the goal, and each, until a month earlier, complete strangers. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are playing very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long character showing both Corey and Vogel, as we see Corey getting out of jail and Vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. The two characters are then methodically collected over the fate at the outdoor guest as Vogel hides inside the trunk of a car by Corey. From this unlikely breakthrough, two strangers agree to become partners who make a perfect and precise jewelry store. But to get this robber, he must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as a certain shooter. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his lease, Jansen is in full battle with DT and spent most of the day on his bed hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the tousled and hallucinating world of William S. Burroughs' dream to a steady and sober shooter is a very quick and perhaps the only fake moment of the film, but I'm just very picky. One more mildly false comment was Inspector Mattei. Occasionally, it seemed brilliant in ways of arming the right people or gathering information and waiting until his prisoner escaped to move. At other times, he seemed to be 10 years after retirement, especially at the beginning during the Vogel escape through the forest. I wonder if I have too hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. At the beginning of the film, when a police car passes through the city, red light is the first image. My first thought was that it could be a "red circle" and that if I have a deeper meaning in the movie, maybe it is that the car, or rather the people inside, who are going through the red light, will be the ones who will stop the robbery jewel. Hmmmm? Maybe the red circle denotes the triumvirate thief ring? Maybe it was a burning sled? No matter what. It's a long movie, but it doesn't feel like it. The end is a little disappointing. It seemed too rushed to a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10 Clark Richards
