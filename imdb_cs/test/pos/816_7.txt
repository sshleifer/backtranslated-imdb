Kitty working girl (Sothern) deals with Bill (Kelly), who neglects her by working in her garage for hours to save money on their marriage. After standing on her birthday, Kitty goes on a double date / blind date to meet the heir of Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). He falls in love, but leaves him when his love protests cover the desire for her to be his mistress rather than his wife. The faithful assembly of the Bill to comfort her, and finally renounces her repeated requests to restore their engagement, under the influence of Bill's support for her family after losing their jobs. But when Bob returns, but believes that he wants marriage after all, will Kitty follow her heart or her conscience? This movie was much better than I expected. The character Bill first comes as a sort of loud comic Irish type that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the screenplay) fill the character with real compassion and love, and Bill appears to be the best person in the group. Viewers can find themselves against the clumsy Hartwell for him! The tone of the film, however, blurs between cheerful romance and a much darker side, especially when viewing a dance marathon and somewhat terrible accident in Bill's garage. The cast is rounded by reliable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a reckless but not yet completely unpleasant Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as ne'er-do-well by Father Kitty.
