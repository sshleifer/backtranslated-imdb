Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This film was basically the first Kung fu movie to be released in the UK in the UK. Many of us pierced Kurosawa's incredibly daring drama game and were used to oriental film. is beautifully shot and illuminated, with somewhat restrained stimulation, all together as a flip through the album of very fine photos that have just been moving. <br /> <br /> Run Shaw and Run. with their widescreen "home movie" production values ​​and amazing mature dubbing for parody, and all the rules have changed. KOng Boxer was the first to pass through the door, leaving a clearly visible trace for the others to follow with their feet firmly on top of the flame steps. Despite hockey areas, pantomime, cheesy jump-cuts and western style spaghetti snap-stepped, this movie was amazing. Beautiful without being opulent and with the most brilliant battle choreography that ever admired the screen. We loved scary violence, anxiety, testosterone. Fighting artists have found some of the fascinating techniques between us if they are spectacular and often silly. It was so different from the Japanese material we all knew and had a beautiful acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the frightening violence and blood-stained floors. Wonderful. "KIng Lear" scene was at that time quite a milestone in "terrible bastards .. My **** !!" Now it's somewhat less shocking, but it's still a little intestine. After seeing more genre films, it now stands out as a sore thumb, but at that time it didn't matter. This film defined what would quickly become a kung fu film cliché. All. Look at it and remember that there was no genre for her until she broke into the Western screens. It was unique and amazing. It was the first movie of kung fu and it is still the best for me and many others.
