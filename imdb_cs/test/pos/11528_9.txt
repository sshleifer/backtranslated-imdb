One way or the other, you cannot get out of the base message. Strong survives. Those who are mentally or emotionally sensitive will leave. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole seen in her perfection as selfish. Phoebe finally realizes it. Just before he helped Wolf, he was cured of his own guilt. She could accept the closure of the missing ... her sister. Beautiful European scenery. Lots of truth about idealism and dependence on another great moment. For a moment I thought about the Baader-Meinhoff gang that was in the early 1970s. I liked this movie because it reflected the time I came alone.
