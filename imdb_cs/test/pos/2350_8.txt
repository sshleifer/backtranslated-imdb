Storyline: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in movies, but direct, and is looking for his first big chance. He finds Molly in the game and immediately knows he's going to be a big movie star. He signs it to a contract with a condition that he must follow. The producer agrees and their great career is in progress. The following is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with a great emphasis on comedy. And yes, there's romance and a little sadness. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are a top event. The music is real and also with some old known melodies. Lots of DVD extras also in this renewed release released in 2008. It should be emphasized that this film is the first story, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films such as, Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic (1969). The peculiarity of this film is that it re-creates silent films in 1939. We see their parts because viewers in the cinema would in this past era (though some sound effects are included) in the gorgeous b & w while the rest of the movie is in the movie. pristine colors. One of the greatest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at this point was on the climb, is superbly used in 2 silent re-created movies and he is at the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch a movie, if your movie history fan, is that beyond everything else, the Hollywood Cavalcade is a film reference of Mack Sennett. This doesn't take the genius to realize this film is a "positive" overhaul of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly is of course Mabel. Sennett had throwing cakes, bathing beauty and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (portrait), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (twin body) and fell in love with his front lady. Not only everything, but Sennett was a technical adviser for the film and it also appears in it. Because most moviegoers prefer sound elements today, those who are associated with short objects and silence are left in the pastures. As Mack Sennett fell into this category, it's lucky that there is a Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was of course very useful in the development of comedy in movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with approximately 500 films. He worked with the best of Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers (in the way up Thar). As film comedy is an extremely difficult journey to continue throughout the career, Mack played it wise and did only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an academic award in the category of short subjects and another in 1937 for his lifetime work. In the 1940s, his presence still felt, for example, here comes Co-eds (1945), where the recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack's wandering Willies (1926) is finished. In 1947, the way to Hollywood, used some Sennett's Crosby movies. Two years later he brought nostalgia with Down Memory Lane, where he participated. With his talent always associating with the right people, the guest role with the ever popular Lawrence Welk and his radio show came later in the year. By 1950 the re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie is made Romance (1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on television, This Is Your Life, then his autobiography, The Comedy King (1954), which is a great companion piece of the Hollywood Cavalry, was published. 1955 brought a more specific relationship with Abbott & Costello when he had a portrait at A&C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957, another tribute to the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you look at the Hollywood Cavalcade, it's the legacy of the film's pioneer. In the movie on the banquet scene, the camera goes to the guests at the long table. When we get to Silver Mack, he turns his head to the camera himself, as if to say, "Here I am!" When he rises to give a speech shortly later, he is at his most subdued, underplaying words gave him as if to mentally communicate, "I know my influence on comedy never ends, but people will forget Mack Sennett's individual. Maybe the movie will help. "
