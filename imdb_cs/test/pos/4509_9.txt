I've never read a book, but I've always heard good things about it. So when the movie came out, I thought I'd see it, but I never did. Now it came out on DVD and I was thinking of hiring for a few weeks. Last night I picked him up. I'm very glad I did it. The film was incredible in this movie. Scenery, etc., Everything made you feel like in Kabul. The meeting was very good, although I am sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good and clean and uplifting. Yes, the story was very sad, but uplifting. And I will be honest, like a white American, ... I have seen the side of Kabul and Afghanistan that I never see my mind in my pictures when I think about it. Afghanistan showed me before the Taliban. He showed me a beautiful place. He showed me a place with good people. Even a community that was like a family, except for a few abusers. Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the best I've ever seen.
