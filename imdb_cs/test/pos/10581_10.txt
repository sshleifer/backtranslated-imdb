Haggard: The film is the real life story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him, also with the help of his two friends, 1. A skateboarder who lives for nothing, and 2. A funny man funny scientist (who really doesn't work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. Haggard The Movie also has a lot of characters from Jackass etc. Bam Marger et al. It is a very weak attempt, it seems to me that it was written when bored, or as a project to which they did not pay much attention. Also films by Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated him, again a very bad actress Jennifer, another actress some people might be interested in is Steve aka Hellboy which RakeYohn plays, which does not appear to be a story, again a bad deal, this character does not have many lines in the movie that make him very boring. but the worst of all is Raab's character, the voice sounds like a smoker who basically has throat cancer, and I think he could be improved! Overall, I think the characters in this movie aren't with the story, as in one scene, it would be on one particular character, a minute later, on another scene, different in character. I say it is supposed to be a movie, a kind of documentary, its characters don't play as a document, acting you think it's a cheap attempt to make a free-time movie. At the center of the movie we start to lose focus on Ryan Dunn's main character, though much attention is on Bam and Brandon. Finally, this movie is fine if you laugh at things that aren't very funny, stupid stunts, horrible gameplay and casual nude scenes! 7/10
