I am ashamed to say it, but I must admit that I only saw this film for the first time about a year ago. After I saw it, I immediately ran out and bought a DVD collector's edition and I watched it many times because. The film is amazing at many levels. It works like your direct monster or movie-like action like horror / sci-fi and also as a very interesting insight into the human psyche. An incredible feeling of paranoia, distrust and fear borrowed not only by the carpenter (which is overwhelming), but also by the incredible casting effect in general. Kurt Russell (apparently) is in the lead role of MacReady underwhelmingly underestimated and as a direct result "feels" like a real person, rather than a Hollywood "all American hero". Other cast members carry their role with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a really fantastic movie.
