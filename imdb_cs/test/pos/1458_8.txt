We have gone far beyond this experimental foray into the forbidden area of ​​drug addiction - for the 1950s. The movie may seem date. The man with the Golden Arm served his function when, in 1955, when I first saw this film in the theater, he tore off the bottom edge of society, the eye-eye to the boy from the southern country. After some serious thinking about being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and impressive, and still keeps the sharp, painful moments of a naked soul. As a film depicting loneliness at the heart of being succeeds. Filled with anxiety, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him attractive to the viewer. He expresses his helplessness and inefficiency in beautifully limited performance. Kim Novak, like Molly, is pretty good as a common sense voice in an urban dead end. It is compassionate and yet stands on a solid surface. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role as the pathetic Zoscha, the mutilated wife of Sinatra. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. His character Sparrow is considered pitiful and despicable and provides momentary comedy moments. Music is almost the star of this movie-tense, frenetic, whimsical, poignant. Elmer Bernstein scores perfectly emphasize the tension of the spiritual weakness and physical need of Frankie Machine heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and captures what the film shows visually. I know of no other sound track that would effectively complement the tension and defeat in man as effectively as he does.
