Minor Spoilers will follow. This film is even stranger and unconventional than "second floor songs". There is no main character we follow. There is no "conspiracy" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no overcrowding. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with revenge. Instead of returning to the convention and a fixed pattern, Roy Andersson focuses his film on an idea. I'm not going to deal with what an idea is, but even if you don't get it, I promise you'll see the greatest visual depth you've ever made. The majestic scenes of "songs" fade in comparison here. Working with visual splendor. So be kind to your neighbor because we're alive, and only you and I have the power to change our lives. This is at least what I thought when I saw the last scene in the movie, with inhuman bomber planes sweeping the city in the movie to get our lives off. And of course don't forget to see this movie when you get a limited edition near you. This is one of those films that really have the power to make you a better person, such as "Sicy's Thieves". Very warm and humanistic film.
