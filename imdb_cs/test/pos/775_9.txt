I watched this movie at ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very attentive and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters has a special mention because she creates an amazing, diverse, interesting character to look at. Ben's character is a little shy and Stoic, but the changes he is going through are beautifully influenced by Rupert Grint, I would say he has a future for Harry Potter. Laura Linney is a pretty good role in her role as Ben is over the protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is to do it too .... Villain. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and eventually he is also very honest. The only character I wasn't excited about was Bryony, she was a bit simple and useless as I thought. Overall, it's a big comedy drama that's very easy to follow. one of my favorite movies of the year easily.
