This movie was great I don't understand, disrespect to get it. Even the first scene of it in as 87-88 and it was actually scary, if you are an 80 horror fan, you should have no problem with this movie it has everything that makes 80 horror great. I have to meet some actors and they were fine. What's not great about the haunted old house, the demons, the crazy party and the horny good-looking young people. Dialogue and special fx have made this movie classic. The film also took care of one of those classic rumors of horror that a black boy doesn't always have to die at the end. Although this movie was great, there is one thing that has left me undiscovered, what really happened to the old couple at the end it was deliberately or not, the little side story always confused me.
