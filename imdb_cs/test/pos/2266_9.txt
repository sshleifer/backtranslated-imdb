I really liked this movie ... but the ads I saw supposed, and one published review actually said this movie "benefits from a light touch." This is very misleading for me. There is indeed a lot of humor: eccentric, no-subtle, sometimes somewhat twisted humor: the kind of humor I am generally very appealing indeed. But most humor is a species that seems to be conscious of all things deeply serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film combines the themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The whole film is hampered by the history of European anti-Semitism in general and the Holocaust in particular. How can you combine humor and horror in the same movie? The review I saw indicated that humor was Absurdist. I don't think that's the case at all; at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this film is a tradition of many Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I am not claiming to be an expert in this field; but from what I have seen, Humor is used in this cultural context as a tool to overcome the terribly tragic experiences of this people; and also humor is used as a means of "divine recovery" for men and women who choose the way of faith rather than the path of despair or absurdism. Check out "Fiddler on the Roof" for humor that is used in both directions in this rich tradition. he wore the same kind of glasses with a freezing effect. In this movie, it's easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both his search and his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are really great. Jonathon and Young Alex are of the same generation, yet they seem very, very different; and then you'll find they're not that different. And the way the apparent narrative voice gradually changes from Jonathon to young Alex ... as the way of intended discovery of Jonathon becomes one of the discoveries for both the young Alex and Alex ... he is so very mobile to me. There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas of (I said) Prague and surroundings, standing in Ukraine's story. Everyone feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; Although I have never been to Ukraine and can hardly testify firsthand. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a light comedy, I don't recommend this movie at all. . On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, beautiful and deeply moving movie, please check out this amazing movie.
