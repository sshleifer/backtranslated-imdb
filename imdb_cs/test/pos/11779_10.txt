I caught this little gem by chance in 1980 or '81. I was in a revival theater to see two old stupid sci-fi movies. The theater was full and (without warning) showed a lot of sci-fi short spoofs (to put us in the mood). Most of them were somewhat amusing, but THIS came in and within seconds the audience was in hysterics! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" with huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. He looks at the camera, gives a grim smile and nods. This is even more fun! You have to see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like Muppet! It was very stupid and stupid ... but I couldn't stop laughing. Most of the dialogue drowned for all the laughter. Also, if you know the "Star Wars" pretty well, it's even more fun - in some dialogues they deliberately play fun. It really works with the audience! Unique 10!
