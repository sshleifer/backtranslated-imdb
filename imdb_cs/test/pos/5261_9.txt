I'm a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested we go see The Women. After reading the reviews, I thought it might lead to an afternoon nap. Bad - this film took me from start to finish. It was great to finally see Mega Ryan again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different than in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age just like Carrie Fisher. Daughter, Molly, was an extremely acted young India. Cloris Leachman and a woman from Finland were amazing as housekeepers who extended their regular duties. NYC scenes were nice to see. And Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual she was amazing. So I gave this chick a flick of 9. Boys-Go to see it just for eye candy like Eva Mendes. It won't fail.
