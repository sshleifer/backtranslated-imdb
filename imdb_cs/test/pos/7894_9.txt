I was surprised at how emotionally invested I was in this film. Peter Boyle is a tour de force as a working-class socially conservative bigot, Joe. I actually sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the basic historical socio-economic reasons for many prejudices. The film also provides an interesting insight into the rapid change that American society has undergone at this time. Recreational drugs, casual sex, and the difficulty of parental authority have become fashionable and have replaced more of the revered tradition of respect for God, earth, and seniority. Susan Sarandon fans will be pleased. Joe is her film debut. It also provides viewers with a visual experience near the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
