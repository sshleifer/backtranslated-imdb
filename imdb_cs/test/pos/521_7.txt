Witchcraft, or witchcraft, as is commonly known in Europe, beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's mother and Father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old, deserted hotel on the island about 50 kilometers from Boston, renovating and reopening. Together with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie plan to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check the amount of work they need, but also to meet the property. Agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. As soon as he enters the hotel and begins to explore the property while Sam is killed on the ship and the ship is released to the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who is researching a book he writes about horrible legends and superstitions around the infamous island & hotel. As night draws from a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious 'lady in black' (Hildegard Knef) still leaps up like an ancient evil that resides in a hotel looking for fresh sacrifices for demonic possession, human sacrifices and satanic ceremonies ... > <br /> The director of this American Italian film is a bit shrouded in mystery, because IMDb introduces Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato has given awards, both in any case honest despite his bad rumors I found Witchery quite entertaining in a so-bad-is-a-good cheese way. Again, the script attributed to Harry Spalding and Daniel Stropp on IMDb is confusing because the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis, just as the one who wrote this thing did a decent job, stop laughing. In the heart of it is a haunted house of horror, but it adds some bloody death and a surreal feeling to everything. Different sets of characters have sensible themes and didn't get on my nerves the way I thought it might be, it's not rendered very well, it doesn't make all sense and dialogue isn't exactly the top drawers of things, but as a whole Witchery entertained me that it is 95 odd and simple. It's pretty good to walk, a little slow to get maybe, but there's a lot of unreal, bizarre distant freaks and terrible deaths to keep one entertained. One part of witchcraft that destroys some of its credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim, Witchery's supposed "twist" end actually didn't work for me and just look on a silly expression on Cummings's face at this last frost. The hotel provides a good isolated location and gives the film a certain atmosphere that is characterized by a distinct indefinable horror horror and cheap horror. Technically, witchcraft is not bad at all, it was obviously shot in place, so it looks good all the time, and although it's not the cutting edge of filmmaking, total production values ​​are a little better than expected. Violence and gore have a typical euro explicitity, a woman has sewn lips and hung inside a fireplace so she can't shout when others light it up, someone is crucified and then burned alive, stabbed by swordfish, some veins spread & pop, and the woman is raped by a man without lips . Witchcraft was filmed in English, so there's no dubbing when it comes to acting, David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair in the same movie, what more can I say?! Yes, ladies Hasselhoff took off his shirt and married Cummings. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are terrified in this matter, but the little child is very annoying and cannot really act at all. I'm sure most of the healthy movie visitors disagree with my views, but I still stand to like that and enjoy watching it again. horror fan in general.
