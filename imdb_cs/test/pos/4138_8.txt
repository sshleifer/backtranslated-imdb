Gary Busey's best performance in a pretty flowing biography. Since he had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see both a great actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best Performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey was nominated for an Oscar and lost to Jon Voight at COMING HOME. A rather low budget that will not disappoint with GREAT SONGS from Mr. Holly. I hope it did a lot of dough. Busey has never been so popular for a variety of reasons, but fortunately this one is big on his resume.
