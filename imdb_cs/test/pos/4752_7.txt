This film does not concern soda or French connection. Seven Ups is a group of elite policemen using tactics that are not in accordance with the NYPD protocol. Scheider leads the group with its polka dots or regular views. They watch the local cartel of Nira and things happen when a police wire is detected. Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most serious man in the movie (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner end up killing a cop by chance and escaping from Scheider in the most amazing scene I've seen, Bullitt French Connection is not as good as the West Side to George Washington and the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. Stunt drivers are amazing and Lynch is gone for free, even though he looks awful without fear of a dangerous journey. Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car knocks down on Mack's back, tearing the roof of his vehicle. Things get to the head and one has to follow the tracking of such a sequence. Fast movement and intense, fresh for thirty years.
