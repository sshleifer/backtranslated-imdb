This movie is about a group of four friends who wreck a car while driving. They build a campfire to get overnight and wait for help. If you want to go through the time, they say frightening stories to each other. To say it would destroy the movie, so rent it and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> I'll say it starts a little slower, but every story gets better and better. This film presents some of today's hottest actors Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are big star names just not really big! GO rental or buy ASAP !! This movie is amazing!
