The Helge Schneider phenomenon defies easy description or quick categorization. For an international audience who didn't know him, it could be said to be a rough mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman, adding playfulness to jazz music and 70s clothes. While his stage performances are eccentric, his films are simply outrageous. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the best Helge movie. He plays in two main roles - police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and killer-villain "Nihil Baxter", and also in the rare minor role of "Dr. Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> The scene, modern art-loving Baxter accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a broken Jaguar when the beloved statue slips out of Baxter's hands and mortally hits Metulskie. When reading a newspaper incident, 00 returns from retirement to investigate a case backed by his loyal sidekick, Lieutenant Koerschgen, who is being played by an older actor with the same name. They quickly pick up Baxter's footprint and interrogate him at his strangely decorated mansion (one of the best scenes of the movie!), But at first he can't gather any evidence. The story goes through many corners, with several scenes that do not always really contribute to the progress of the plot, but are cheerfully funny, such as dreaming about 00 (including the most unusual view of a running male short crotch in the history film), the police department during Koerschgen gets in line with the boss and has to be hospitalized, and a visit to the aforementioned Dr. Hasenbeina. Baxter is finally caught by an attempt to escape to Rio de Janeiro on the plane. It is always worth mentioning, in particular, Andreas Kunze, who in this case is playing wife 00, when she usually appears in the campaign of female roles in the film Helge's Movies. So all those out there looking for new laughter, I recommend this movie. Catch? You must understand German (because I doubt there is an English version) ...
