In my opinion, the film is best rated by the number of "best scenes". There are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the entire movie that someone or others probably think is "best". This film is a masterpiece. Time. I know many people who have called it before their time, probably because they bombed at the box office. However, I think that any generation can have this film and have a good laugh. I'm personally happy that Mahmood is also part of the movie. His role is not such "fleshy", but it is good to see that he is part of the cast of the funniest Hindu film ever.
