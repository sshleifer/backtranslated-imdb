RENDITION is a movie that you can't miss with the hard writing from Kelley Sane and the direction of Gavin Hood, who takes us to a story that travels through the male way of hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in the convincing role of the CIA today and great performances from the cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with the Middle East descent actors who add to the story's reality. In RENDIC you see how "terrorism can raise terrorism" and as the film progresses by tying the story to what is happening in the Middle East, reality is brought to the screen. External footage contributes to the intensity of the story, and Peter Sarsgaard does a great job of playing an assistant in the way American politics follows. It is a pity that there was no bigger audience for this film, because together with VALLEY ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS, RENDITION plays an important role in showing viewers how the struggle for democracy protection and democracy protection can go astray.
