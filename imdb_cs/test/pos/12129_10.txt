"Let me ask one more question" Ha! what great soon .. this movie was a great fantastic performance, great script. The only reason nobody noticed it was because of the low budget, everyone agrees with me that his cult, as well as "Donnie Brasco", shows young Joe Pesci as gangsters, this film is their cult. His got some sopranos and some chases with good friends got his idea for soprano when he watched it and Scorsese found Joe Pesci while watching it, proving that he must be big i'm fine or i'm wrong 'eh?. I have to admit that they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts in the piano stop "Stop with Peanuts".
