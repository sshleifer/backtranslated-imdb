"Tough Luck", like a clogged country road, takes the viewer to the ride. There is nothing wrong with the plot curves if the credibility does not get out of the window. Unfortunately, the film unfortunately challenges the audience's tolerance. However, it is easy to forgive this mistake through superior acting, character development and a wonderful carnival atmosphere. Do not expect you to like any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus, and Dagmara Dominczyk, play shady con-artists, not exactly the type of person he easily admired. Double crosses come quickly and furiously, and the last cross is a bit elongated. Recommended. - MERK
