This is a very pleasant, fluffy, charming 40s musical. 'Girl Cover' made Rita Hayworth (formerly dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide, an all-American star. He confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It represents the exuberance and color of the music genre. Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker - it's her picture and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed, but her dance is absolutely brilliant and she is very well connected with Kelly. I think Rita was highly underrated as an actress - here she plays every scene great. Gene's choreography dance sequence (he was basically got almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is amazing. Such art. Permanent tunes are "Make Way For Tomorrow", "Put Me To Test" and of course "Long Ago and Far Away". The plot is somewhat thin, yet it is moral. It is about the dangers of fast fame and fast money and how eventually every happiness with these factors will eventually be doomed. It encourages you, lifts you to your feet and makes you laugh. That means 'Cover Girl' is not the biggest musical ever - it has a number of drawbacks to be addressed. One can say that Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character is quite boring. But I was impressed by his dancing skills and how he managed to keep up with Gene and Rita. Another big problem is that too many songs just aren't that great. "Cover Girl" looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. 'Poor Tom' is a huge descent. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've heard in a 1940s musical. It stinks. Grandma's sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these elements. <br /> <br /> Although it's just a very bad movie, much better than most of the products that look like today. Dance and singing are noble, production values ​​are excellent and the mood is infectious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
