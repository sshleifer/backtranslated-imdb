'Thriller' remains the biggest pop promo with conspiracy, great visual effects and a high-end song that wraps the film around. Michael Jackson was on top of the tree at this time (and not so changed in his plastic surgery mode to matter). Here he is in good shape - the song is amazing, he leads the zombies in a dance like no other. Ola Ray plays a girl who watches with incredible how her sweet friend (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! Then to the pulsating rhythms of the opening line, "It's almost to midnight," he stamps around the graveyard with the other zombies and the creatures of the night. The crowning glory of all this is the fruity voice of all the great horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the record. Amazing.
