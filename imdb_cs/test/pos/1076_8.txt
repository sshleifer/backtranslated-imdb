A very interesting document - certainly more than a side-pseudo-wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the document - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker - only two men dictate the nature of the wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert based in Bordeaux and also known as a "flying vintner". The director is smart enough to talk to local wine producers from many different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina, and talks of the biggest industry players, such as the Mondavi family, about the globalization of winemaking and marketing. He must see for all those interested in the dark side of industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and business meeting after watching this well documented documentary.
