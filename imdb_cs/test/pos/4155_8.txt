"Nuovomondo (2006)" (listed in the US as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and I think it's better - than most films about poor people who leave Europe and come to the United States. The film begins with scenes in a poor rural region. Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you will not really understand the consequences of this sentence until you see the first half hour of "Golden Door". The middle part of the film is dedicated to a long voyage to the US. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of third-class people who become sea sickness, and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we have a sense of life under the decks, and it's not charming. (We never actually saw the Statue of Liberty.) Finally, a typical film will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then the immigrants go through the New York Side. Not here - the experience of Ellis Island occupies about one third of the footage. Vincenzo Amato is excellent as Salvatore Mancuso, who brings his two sons and his mother to his new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious Englishwoman who also speaks fluent Italian. There are some special touches in the movie, especially the soundtrack with Nina Simone's songs. There must be some symbolism, but I couldn't understand. Another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will be better seen in theater than on DVD. Yet a large screen or small screen is worth looking for.
