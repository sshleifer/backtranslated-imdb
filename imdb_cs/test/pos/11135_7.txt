In 2023, in a world dominated by the economic interests of large corporations (and not by people or politicians), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agent. It is referred to as "sub" (sub-human) and its genetic composition is 80% of humans and 20% of animals. It has a combination of bombs that give it strength and flexibility; a falcon who gives her greater ability to see and hear; and a chameleon that gives her the power of camouflage. In the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, using sex to achieve information. I haven't seen it yet, but in this third is a story full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of energy production for fifteen years. Research has not yet been closed when one of them betrayed another and steals research. The problem is that because of its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and the entire planet will be sucked. Where Will Dr. Saves Save Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), surviving a team of scientists and trying to get a dangerous inventor out of the hands of "bad guys". There is a very strong `sub 'in this gang that causes a lot of trouble for Kam. This action and science fiction TV movie is better than the first one, reminiscent of "Terminator" in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress and her clothes are very cool. I'm becoming a fan of this good fun. Sci-fi movie fans will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy `Chameleon 2 '. My vote is seven.
