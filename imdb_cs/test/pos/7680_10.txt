When I was a kid, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey laughed at me. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as big as Sportin Life. The music was just breathless. When I had my first son and the film came on television, I let him see it and never forgot about this film. He loved it. I'll always remember Porgy and Bess. He has a special place in my heart. I really wish they would re-create this movie because it was one of the biggest movies ever with the "Black Cast" star.
