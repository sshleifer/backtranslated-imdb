Black comedy is not always easy to sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is extremely successful, such as Fargo. But they usually don't find a large audience. People seem to think of either comedy or serious chaos. There seems to be no big market for a good mix of both. Throwing Momma The train was a pretty good hit, but few people seem to remember much about it today. Danny DeVito has just left the park in 1987. DeVito plays a boy of a special mom named Owen, who wants to get rid of her incredibly enthusiastic and uncomfortable mother with whom she still lives. . Mother plays Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after she was released and is pretty cartoon. It is loud, ugly, indecent and unbearable. Although Owen hardly seems to take care of himself, he wants desperately to let his mother offend. He raves about it in some really strange scenes, but he clearly doesn't have the guts to actually do it himself. This is where Billy Crystal comes. Crystal plays Larry Donner, a teacher of Owen's creative writing at a nearby university school. Larry is a paranoid wannabe intellectual who claims his ex-wife stole her novel and made millions. He is currently trying to write a new one, but he cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. "The night was ..." Owen hears that Larry wants his ex-wife to die in the school canteen. Owen borrowed an idea from Strangers on the train and decided to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's ex-wife. When he seems to have done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even engaging. It is certainly never boring and often full of surprises. Acting is exceptional, though Ramsey was a bit above the top. The crystal is as good as he and DeVito has always been underestimated as an artist. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The film uses some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as a time of artistic malaise and true lazy film. Throw Momma From the Train's Chance. How in how his characters are drawn, so in a general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son who has a murdered mother? The film is not too long and full of tranquility. Writers are preferable to consider it more interesting than the general public, but everyone can still enjoy it. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
