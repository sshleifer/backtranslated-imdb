If you haven't seen this late 80s movie about the Washington Bureau Network News Station before I highly recommend it. It is a sad commentary on the direction of news in this country, but it tells the story with a joke. The characters are well developed and the performance of Albert Brooks is wonderful. It adds all its lines to a fun comedy. I'm not a Albert Brooks fan at all, so it was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and recommends that it's close to reality, so kudos to film writers and directors do their research. <br /> <br /> A fun movie with lots of insights into the World of Network News. It's not nearly dark as another film I recommend in the same genre of "Network".
