I haven't seen it since 1998, and yet I can't get it out of my head, or stop recommending people to find it by showing what it did. Just a wonderful story. br /> <br /> I hope to see the staircase at least once in person ... <br /> <br /> I didn't really know about this movie about Mr. Petersen because I didn't see him from his previous works but his acting he impressed me and I think his depiction of Grissom on CSI just shows more. He knows enough to let the character show through, instead of showing through the actor, making him a much better actor. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the "bad accents" I should comment on. she had to say I always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all her roles, and I thought she'd done a phenomenal job in this movie.
