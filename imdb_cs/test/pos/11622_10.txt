I was very impressed by the young life experience of a man who was so high in academia. A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and an extended family of companions created a person able to succeed in the world. Hispanic culture is largely shown because I have always watched and admired - hardworking, optimistic and truly family-oriented. Religious superstitions were completely authentic to the Catholic Church. The actress who played the mother undoubtedly deserves an Oscar. Her prayers for her missing son overwhelmed me to tears. I recommend this amazingly thought-out movie to my friends and family.
