While it may seem a bit bizarre to see that a 32-year-old plays part of a twelve-year-old woman, Mary Pickford will soon forget the inconsistencies and simply enjoy the fun. Mary is a street boy in New York City, with her own nice gang of mischief makers, attended by older William Haines (at the time he was 25 and just at the tip of his own screen) <br /> <br To give too much plot would not be fair. It is enough that Mary is great to watch and shows why she was the first and most popular star of Hollywood. The production values ​​are very good, with lots of accessories making NYC street scenes quite credible.
