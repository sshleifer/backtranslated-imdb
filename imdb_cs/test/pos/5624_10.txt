Chris Smith's American film is a detailed study of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent filmmaker from Wisconsin. Mark dreamed of becoming a great writer and director because he was a teenager and had a hi8 camera he focused on. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream movie, Northwestern. There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie, as Mark goes through the pre-production of Northwestern and later his short film Coven (pronounced co-out, correct pronunciation, Mark says: "Sounds too much like an oven") he plans. Use it to get money to complete the Northwestern. The insight and humor of this film is at the same level as Roger and Me, a great film by Michael Moore. I first looked at it at the Sundance chaotic film festival, which brought the spirit of the film - a giant air duct dropped from the ceiling at the beginning of the film, hit seven people and caused a delay of twenty-five minutes; In the middle of the movie, the sound fluttered and the projector had to be stopped to fix it, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped and the film burned. Despite the delay, the audience remained through the movie and gave it standing ovations. The American film won the Grand Jury Prize for the documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this fine film, which is worth sitting in any hell screening.
