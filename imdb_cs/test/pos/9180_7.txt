When one watches romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; We've seen enough, many years, to know how they go. There is a formula that almost always produces films that become popular with the audience genre ... not always in relation to their true quality. How do you play with it and create something more interesting? This movie has a proposal ... and it works pretty well. Instead of following the leadership, we follow him cleverly assisting the unhappy men, those who lack an attractive facade that would allow them to discover the invisible good qualities that they have in love with women. The story follows Smith as he works on his self-proclaimed hardest such case; Kevin James. Along with his help, James watches Mendes, who is full of people who lie to get what they want (one particular scene that inspires great respect for Smith's character is that he meets one such idiot and builds him up) to its place). After seeing Smith help a catastrophe that is James, we see him and Mendes ... and despite his talent to help others to be with her ... wrong ... with her. Make an amazing point about love and how he fell in love with her. For a romantic comedy, this mostly avoids the pitfalls of such (occasionally almost bordering on the feeling as a spoof of the genre), though the last few scenes have the sweetness and emotions of this type of films. Whether the formula follows will not be revealed in this review. The tempo is pretty good, it never really slows down and rarely moves too fast. Acting is great when it comes to everyone. The characters are nicely developed and look like real people. Humor doesn't always work ... there are sometimes gags that are less than fortunately executed, and one or two jokes that seem to be forced. However, for the most part, the film was funny. I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies and anyone who is or has been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have hard times in the last few situations. 7/10
