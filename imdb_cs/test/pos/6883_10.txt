It's pretty simple that those who call this movie "decent" don't know their cinema. "Doll Master" creates a sense of horror and tension rarely seen in movies outside Asia. Think about the "Manga" and "Ring" blends rolled into one and that's what it all is about. . <br /> <br /> Premium acting, first-rate, first-class sets and effects. This is right there with the best Asian horror movie; Ringu, Dark Water and The Story of Two Sisters. <br /> <br /> Absolute necessity. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
