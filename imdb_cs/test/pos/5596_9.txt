Race Against Fear must be one of the most moving TV movies I've seen for a long time. All performances from major actors were excellent, especially that of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Above all, Ariana put on extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions. She portrayed the emotions Mickey felt perfectly, and you could easily believe she was actually raped, so her performance was realistic. <br /> <br /> The RAF is an incredibly realistic movie, thanks to its casting performance. Bullimer came incredibly well as a rapist and you hated him more and more when the movie went on. Blakely also put on emotional performance as the mother of a rape girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt more and more sorry about the Carlyle family because no one believed them about rape. <br /> <br /> All in all, the RAF is a great movie. It is both moving and full of tension because you are not always sure whether Ansom would be prosecuted for rape because of the lack of witnesses, evidence, and beliefs about the claim. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
