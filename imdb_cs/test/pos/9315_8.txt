I've heard a lot about Porn Holocaust and his two movies Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were shot simultaneously in the same place with the same actors who exchanged clothes for each film (and put them off). If you expect D'Amato genius in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you won't find him here. However, this movie has the magic that exploitative fans will not be able to resist. Where else do you see hardcore sex mixed with zombies / monsters and his huge cock that strangles and chokes women to death? Only from D'Amato. There is some amount of gore in which many men are bludgeoned to death. The film is set on a beautiful tropical island. If I know there is no subtitle version, so if you don't want to speak Italian, you don't know what's going on ... but who cares properly? In all honesty, Gore fans will probably be fast forward through hardcore sex. And if someone is watching it just for sex, it will definitely be offended immediately. I can imagine that modern-day porn fans watch D'Amato's output and come up with this cruelty! Of the two I find Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead far better. But don't bother to see if they're cut. The Holocaust Porn is expected to be extremely low in budget. Even a monster doesn't look as good as George Eastman's character in anthropophagus. The film is worth watching laughter and complete the film search for D'Amato.
