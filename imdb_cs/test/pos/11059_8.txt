This short film certainly doesn't draw. The story is about a butcher who illegally kills an innocent man he believes to have sexually harassed his retarded daughter. The film goes on to tell how the butcher serves his time and returns to life with his daughter in care and has to cope with a life without a future. Graphic Opening Scenes of a Horse Being defeated, and the full frontal birth of a butcher's daughter gives you a brutal framework of mind that will stay with you throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The subtle flow of film is very straightforward and adds to its brutality. As a result, a lot of terrain is covered within 40 minutes. You get to the full with the butchers - especially after losing their daughter to social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Seul Contre Tous
