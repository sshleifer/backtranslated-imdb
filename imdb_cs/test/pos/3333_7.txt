"Saint takes over" stars George Sanders as Simon Templar, aka "Saint" in this 1940 entry into the series. It also stars Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board the ship on his way to the US, Saint meets and tries to make time with his wife (Wendy Barrie), who gives him a brushoff. Simon comes to New York to help Inspector Fernack, now thoroughly discredited for the gangster frame; $ 50,000 was found in his house. Gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was not found guilty on trial, and he and his gangster colleagues pay a frame bill and represent lawyers - a total of $ 90,000. Today, you need to defend yourself against the parking ticket. That was a murderous rap. Rocky sends her guard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer's house to steal $ 90,000 from the vault. The lawyer catches him by the red hand and sends him back to the boss with the message. A few seconds later he is dead. Rocky meets a similar fate. And on and on - who kills this group of gangsters? The saint must get one of them to speak so Fernack can be cleaned up - can he get to anyone before they are murdered? The woman he encountered on board the ship would, in this case, reappear and stand up. Few actors have a journey with a line like George Sanders and his dry wit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as Simon Templar actor perfectly. Paul Guilfoyle provides some humor as nervous, milk drinking Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is great as ever irritated but worried Inspector Fernack. Wendy Barrie, who has appeared in many Saint episodes, is very good as a woman who captures Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
