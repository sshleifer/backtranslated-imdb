Focus is another great movie with William H. Macy. I first discovered Macs in Fargo and I saw a few of his movies and didn't let me down. Macy is an archetypal "nice guy with something hiding". At Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hard worker who pampers his disabled mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is Head of Human Resources for a company that is essentially anti-Semite. After hiring a woman of Jewish origin, he is asked to buy glasses to improve his evil eyesight. Incredibly, the simple act of buying glasses has a big impact on his life and that Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by Laura Dern). As the film collapses, Newman begins to see a different world where Judaism is similar to being an animal. The film is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something quite normal. The frosty thought is that in some places it may still be.
