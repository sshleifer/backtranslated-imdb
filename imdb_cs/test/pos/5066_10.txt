It was a great movie with a good acting performance that will catch you until the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the theme, and that's why it's so waste. This could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the American Pie series a higher ranking. Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent who is watching an interrogation of an Egyptian man, Marocans, not Egyptians. It should not be a hardened agent, so it comes as naive to the investigative techniques used. This is more plausible than if he came to see him as an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story swayes a bit and can be confusing, but it also allows you to focus on what's going on until the end when everything goes down when the puzzle falls into place. Supporting actors did a good job of carrying the film. I found that the film is powerful and provocative.
