Jack and Kate first meet the doctor Daniel Farady and then with the psyche Miles Straume and prove that they did not come to the island with the intention of saving the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, and Ben Linus shoots her. Meanwhile, the group Jack finds a pilot Frank Lapidus who landed a helicopter with less damage that can be repaired. Jack of Power Miles tell the real intention why they came to the island. The second episode of the fourth season returns to the island, with four new characters, stops the confusing "flash-forward" and seems to finally be the beginning of the explanation that I (and most fans and spectators) expect that they will be provided in "Lost". Why is the government's interest in Ben Linus, and how is it informed from the ship, some of the questions I expect in the next episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
