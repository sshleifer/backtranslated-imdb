Wow! Where to start? This adaptation of Sarah Waters' third novel is one of my favorite movies ever !!!!! I'm not big at playing novels (I NEVER read fiction), but the book is just like FABULOUS as a movie! Or should I say the movie is just like FABULOUS as a book?! I LOVE THIS STORY !!!!! Anyway, I've been watching this three-hour film for about three and a half years (2 sub-series on DVD, 3 sub-series on TV / book) for about a year and a half. It just didn't look so interesting ... BOY I HAPPY SO! I immediately immersed myself in a rich and exciting plot ... absolutely fascinated! Like a book, you can't stop watching / reading. She realizes your attention for 3 hours ... and when it ends ... you wish it didn't. The story is so beautiful and you'll be wondering where the time went. The lesbian subplot was just a cake topping! The most common work is the subtle facial expressions and eye / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for themselves, and yet they can't act on it until they have to. I can point out that "lesbian theme" is an important part of the movie, of course there is a real unexpected love story at the heart of the movie, but it's definitely not what the whole movie is about. makes this story so unique and interesting. I've never read or heard anything like that. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> Twist and twist occupy the leaves that hang on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were gripped on the couch with every surprising plot and I screamed several times ("OH MY GOD! NO!" /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I wish that but of course the adaptation should be time limited, they couldn't add everything I liked, but it's terrible ... I think I'm just brutally selfish now ... forgive me. /> <br /> It seems that the last 20 minutes is a bit of a hurry, however, they have given all the important bits where even if you just watch the movie and decide not to read the book, you will be most satisfied with the result. <br /> <br / Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such a great atmosphere on the chemistry screen to light up your TV. It is seemingly effortlessly expressed by these amazingly talented Rupert Evans plays such a good evil guy as a Gentleman, and every time he came on the screen, I found myself in something I like, but she loves it because she's so damn cute and somehow charming, even if you want to crouch. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. She is such a warm actress that you can't help her, but you love her ... even though the character she plays is not so pleasant. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They really represented the characters well and were just as I imagined they would be after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is to be seen for all movie enthusiasts! Actually, everyone and everyone should see this film and read the book! Chances are you won't be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars out of me! There are only four other movies that I have given the same reviews too. It's very rare to actually enjoy the movie so much that I gave it to him 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is really a masterpiece!
