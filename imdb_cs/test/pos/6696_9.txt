Like some of the best movies and serials, I still came across. It was late, the storm was in full force outside, and I was sitting comfortably on the couch as I walked past a channel that was just about to show one of the episodes. I just wanted to watch for a few minutes and wait for the ads to be completed on another channel before returning to one of the other sitcoms. An hour and a half later, I remembered my determination and was so happy that I didn't. Needless to say, I made sure I saw all the other episodes. John Hannah was brilliant in almost everything I saw him, and he wouldn't even allow it here. All other cast members also do stellar work. My personal favorite (except John Hannah, of course) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is a limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH alone and another 1 with someone else. I'd like to see McCallum back on the screens, though it would have to be with JH!
