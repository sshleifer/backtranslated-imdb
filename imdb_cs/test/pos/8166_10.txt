First I would like to say that I am just an amateur in commenting on movies and that English is not my native language, but that I felt a strong feeling that made me write about such a film; maybe as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, cast and crew for such a great production. I watched "Last Days" for the first time yesterday. At first I thought it might be similar to the film "Priest", which I liked very much for showing a homosexual from the closet. However, the "priest", perhaps because of his limited Catholic ideological concepts, did not present to his viewers the needs by revealing a deep sad end. and some others, such as the Mormon principles); representing a gentle and cheerful story that leads him to a happy and emotional ending, yet inspires the feeling of God's blessing and hope. Great movie really! Somehow "The Last Days" felt like the city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes amazingly beautiful stories about gay love!
