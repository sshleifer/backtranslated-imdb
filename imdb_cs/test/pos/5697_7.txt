<br /> <br /> Since I'm a teenager, I have about a hundred years of movies. I'm trying to see a mix of classic, mainstream, art-house and other movies. The 1970s is one of the most important decades for films: it is when the average, ordinary, classic film has turned into a full message and antisocial behavior. It happened like nothing he had ever seen before. What the Decade under influence basically shows is the importance of all the Star Wars films around. Richard LaGravenese and late Ted Demme are the primary interviewers of this documentary, interviewing them by people like Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among others about how the couple years has changed the cinema forever. It is a very professional, polished document that is even funded by IFC films. However, because it is very professional, I think at least they would laugh. This means to me that the whole thing was clean and clean. On the other hand, it is a very interesting documentary about the film of people who do it. Of course, they don't threaten their own movies or anything, but they show the honesty of what they think about movies and what they mean. I don't know much about the film (but I want to get involved when I become an adult), so I feel like someone who is like me, this movie is a huge asset. I have seen a good number of movies he has mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest, but somewhat more insightful about these films. The main reason I am In love The influence is as smooth as it was being edited, it seemed to take its time at the beginning and it is quite relaxed, and therefore it does not have enough time to be he got everything they wanted to show. In the last few minutes, they had crammed into star wars and jaws when the two most important. It seemed as if they were trying to show a lot of clips, and that was fine, but some of them were unimportant, for example, expanded from the network. But overall, Influence is a very fascinating, informative document that has at least helped me to learn more about the second "golden age" in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rating R for language and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
