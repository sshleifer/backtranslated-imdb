Initially I was postponed renting this movie due to the jacket art for DVD. In fact, it was true of my friends who had not rented him for the art and mental image he had conjured from being a film that interested me little or no interest (or my friends). But I rented it and watched it and I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comment that this movie is not for everyone because of obvious sexual conclusions, so it's definitely not something I want. small children look (and seriously doubt if they understand it anyway). I like those movies when character figures and who are truly defined in a pointless, straightforward way, without showing that they will be wrong. Negotiations ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson played so well, I was drawn into this movie and I didn't even realize they were acting. The same thing with the story ... may seem a little appealing, but it was so very, very well. It reminded me of another film with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, either mental or indirect, so they were well defined. The feeling that everyone involved (from cameramen to actors) should be rewarded for the perfect fit / result. After seeing this movie, I talked to a few friends who had a negative attitude to observation, as I did, so they rented and watched them after hearing their notes. They too were quite surprised how well it was. It's too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was because it's off. Now I see how art is applied, but I haven't heard of this film yet and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys the sale / rental of DVDs. These characters had more depth to them and the good timing was allotted to give viewers like me time to absorb the "feel" for everyone. I felt I could trust the movie and did it. So, with an art jacket aside, I recommend watching this movie.
