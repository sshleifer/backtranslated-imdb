WOW I love this movie. This is definitely added to my Ghetto Movie List. Juice - Starring Tupac 'I Don't Giva F ***' Threat II Company - O-Dawg 'I'll Smoke Someone, I Just Giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hi Stealing Cars For Wide daylight, which obviously has no chance *** New Jersey Drive is the best hooded movie ever. This is at the top of the list, Threat II company is second, and juice is third, Clocks are really stupid. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack for New Jersey Drive's Pwnage Mac Mall & Young Lay - Everything about my fetti is heard through out the movie. Wow Underground - Burn Rubber, Another Good Song, So Is Ill & Al Scratch - Don't Turn Off for Players <br /> <Br /> If your GTA-SA fan is going to freak out this love movie, And amazing soundtrack. Soundtrack is basically Rap about car theft ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
