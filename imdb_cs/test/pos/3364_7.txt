The 1970s are often regarded as the golden age of the British television comedy, a period that has seen numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows such as "Monty Python's Flying Circus". However, the period was not a significant golden age of British film comedy, and what worked on television rarely succeeded in bringing it to the big screen. Most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Brian's Life") were very different in conception to their television show. The main problem with adapting cinema sitcoms is that concepts designed to fit within the 30-minute BBC slots (25 minutes for ITVs that need to find space for ads) don't work whenever they're expanded for a feature film three or four times. Few people will remember the movie version, say "Up Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as the TV version. In the case of many classic television comedy shows ("Some Mothers Do" Ave "Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "Goodies") no attempt has been made to film them at all, for which we can \ t . Characters such as Frank Spencer Michael Crawford and John Cleese's Basil Fawlty may be cheerful in half-hour bursts, but I doubt they would be so fun for two hours. One comedy program (though the drama of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense) which could have worked in the cinema was "Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin", but some hopes of the film were interrupted tragically early by the death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Dad's Army" was one of the few television sitcoms of the period that turned into a decent movie. (The only other one I think is "mash"). This was perhaps because it had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of its humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the home guard's disaster in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The home guard, initially known as local defense volunteers, was an instrumental militia during World War II formed, for the most part, of the men too old to serve in regular forces). The film version is a triple drama. Law I deals with the creation of a platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Law II they cause confusion during military training. In Act III, they manage to capture a group of Nazi pilots whose aircraft was shot down. Three key players in this drama are platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, which in civilian life is a local bank manager, is a cunning little man, peering in the world through a pair of thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form a home guards unit and appoints his commander. He is pompous, ugly, with an exaggerated sense of his own meaning and his own leadership skills as he is not fond of. (And in the world view of George Mainwaring, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of the human race). But it has its good qualities. He is motivated by true patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage as shown by his encounter with the Germans. Wilson is a representative of Mainwaring at the bank. Both men have a very different character, something that emphasized the difference in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin, while Mainwaring is short and strong. He comes as more intelligent and better educated than his boss. (His accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy). However, he ended up playing second violin in both civilian and military life, presumably because he has a kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take something entirely seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs a local butcher shop. (His promotion to corporal is mainly due to his ability to bribe the Mainwaring with sausages on the black market). His enthusiasm for his new role is only offset by his inability and ability to cause chaos. Although his catchphrase is "Don't Panic!" he is given to panic at any given opportunity. Several other platoon members are presented. Private Fraser, a Scottish Scottish enterprise, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are doomed, man, DOOMED!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is where the nearest toilet is located. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney Spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) corrupt mom's boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson is trying to keep this liaison secret from dissenting Mainwaring). Two prominent outsiders are the slightly raised Vicar and ARP Overseer, the Mainwaring's uncertain enemy, and his equality in pomp and crime. Occasionally, he quits the predatory doubles ("Keep your hands in front of my soldiers") Mainwaring is reportedly referring to those soldiers who have this rank, more than a TV show that was surprisingly simple allusion. (His creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, would later continue to make comedy shows such as "You Are Being Served?" And "Hi-de-hi", which were notorious for suggestive humor). However, the film retains most of the blend of subtle wit, nostalgia and sharp characterization that has made the TV series so successful. 7/10
