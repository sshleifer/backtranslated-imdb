The sad thing about Frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes, you really start to realize it's not far from what's going on in real life. What is really sad is that it also makes it extremely funny. The Frontline team on One consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who really lives and dies only by the ratings he gets his show. At times his bits to achieve these ratings see him running with his line maker Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all of her journalistic integrity and is ready to defend moral fraud from time to time. The same cannot be said of Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) reporter - a reporter who spilled all of her stuff - so much that he must be instructed to laugh when talking to Ben Elton. Her reports usually consist of interviews with personalities (with whom she has or does not have "crossed paths" with earlier) or scandalous unethical messages that usually fail. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is a reporter with whom the team relies on gravity and dignity because he has had the cleverness of 21 years of journalism. His principles are not as much as the nous of what makes a good journalistic story, even though he sometimes draws an occasional line. After this chaos (in the name) it's Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) an egoistic, naive reporter who doesn't see it as a pretty face for rough journalism. He often finds his morale to be compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. Frontline is a kind of show that there must be more because it shows that while in modern times interesting things are happiness, security and deep political insight; It is much easier to evaluate scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
