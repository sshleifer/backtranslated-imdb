Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio, William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley, Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle; Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus; Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) experiment with clandestine experiences near death and afterlife ) search for medical and personal enlightenment. After one, each student's heart is stopped, then revived. Under temporary deadly spells, every bizarre vision is experienced, including forgotten memories of childhood. Their flashbacks are like baby nightmares. The revived students are disturbed by remembering the regrets they have committed or done against them. As they live the afterlife, they bring real life experiences to the present. As they continue the experiment, their memories dramatically intensify; so many, some are physically overcome. So, they probe and go deeper into death-after life experiences trying to find a cure. Although the DVD was released in 2007, this film was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts & Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult career. Besides being an extremely interesting, exciting building with a dramatic climax and a strict and persuasive scenario, all young actors are doing "Flatliners", which is now a stellar cult semi-science fiction. Who, 17 years ago, knew that this young actor's film career would be soaring? I suspect director Joel Schumacher did it.
