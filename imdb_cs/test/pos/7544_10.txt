Alistair Simms is in it. He's doing such a good director. The role that George Cole got here was created for him. So casting on this film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything clicked. The Story Was Good, Comic Dialogue Screaming And Elder Prefect Girls Pleasure! Every character you are endowed with, even the rascals. Why can't we make such films anymore. Basically it is a very English comedy with good movement and fluency.
