Before Barton jumps through my notes, let's just remember that opinions are like donkeys, we all have them ..... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver & Jeff Daniels, I loved dialogue and thought that the meeting was noble. Downplayed perfectly and underestimated. Unlike some others, I couldn't find it @ predictable. I found that Sigourney's role is a refreshing and realistic, especially her scene confronting a tyrant in a trailer. <br /> <br /> I found it nice and does not assume it would recommend it to everyone and different. That's why there are different ice cream flavors, something that will please everyone ...
