Normally I am a typical girl who is "fearsome-shy", but after watching this movie (of course on YouTube) I have different perspectives. And I also didn't know that my favorite animation studio, Fleischer, made another film about a community of insects whose urban garden house is threatened by people (lit cigars and cigarette butts, steps, etc.). and honey bees win the heart; I love beautiful Mrs. Honey. You know, after watching the movie, bugs reminded me of some of the "bugs" of Thumbel's Don Bulth. And from the songs in the movie, I like "We're a couple at the castle;" when I sing that song, it almost made me cry. This wonderful movie was the second (and last) feature that came out of Fleischer's studio. The film was originally to be released in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival, Disney, published Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately went to, then unrealized, a trap. horrible timing. With the opening disaster two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and led to the expulsion of Max and Dave Fleischer, from the studio they founded in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another huge factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were not talking to each other because of the disputes (how sad it was). Overall, I like both films from Fleischer bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
