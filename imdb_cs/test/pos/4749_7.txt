How did they get that the film shot of the car collided with the back end of the semifinals? And Roy sits down - great! It looks like the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - about the time !! Watch this on a big screen or movie revival in the theater if possible to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category include: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullring with Steve McQueen; Live and die in LA with a boy when he was young; French connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Denir; Vanishing Point with Barry Newman; Again enemy of the state with Hackman - What are your favorites?
