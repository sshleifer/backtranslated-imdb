Utopia, made in 1950 in France, was the last movie Laurel and Hardy produced. With a bad reputation the duo has for their after 1930 production I expected this film to be terrible. Although it is not at the level of their "vintage" comedy, I was pleasantly surprised. It's observable, and in part really funny! And certainly there is a plot of the same standard you would expect. Some gags are derived from their earlier work, but when you think this movie was their first five years after their latest Hollywood movie "The Bullfighters", routines are done with confidence as you would expect from these professionals. Some scenes aren't too much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are funny and as such totally priceless. Especially I enjoyed the scene before bedtime. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I felt sad. Our own heroes are left on their own desert island. It is such a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and the audience of that time entrusted the stars to the desert island of memories, and this was to become the last picture they portrayed in the film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan declined the offer to appear in "He's a Mad Mad Mad World" in 1963. What a pity that was - a color film, just two years before he went through. However, his health wasn't too much. These boys are probably the greatest comedic artists of all time, and while the film is far from their real potential, it's still an honor to watch them in the movie they appear last time and touch the echos of their talent.
