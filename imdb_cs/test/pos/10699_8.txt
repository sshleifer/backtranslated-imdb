This is a pretty stupid movie, including what may be the smallest erotic story to get on the big screen (the heroine pours V-8 on her own and invites the hero to lick him - yuck!). And yet it is also a great Lucinda Dickey in what's most erotic performance. In those early days, women - even action heroes - were a rarity with real muscles, and I still remember how my jaw dropped when Dickey undressed her shirt and revealed the strongest female back and biceps. ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could be Schwarzenegger's wife if anyone saw how to support her.
