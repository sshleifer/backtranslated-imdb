This film is in many ways beautiful: conspiracy, depth of character, stunning photos and gaming, colossal scenes of battles (without computer graphics, only thousands of people). Someone said the story had something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedy. I also find some connection with the tradition of Greek tragedy. The Emperor, acting extraordinarily, fighting between power and love, is forced (for the greater good, for the will of his ancestors) to choose strength (and loneliness, hatred of his objects and kins) as his destiny. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good man before he became emperor. Once he has gained power, he must be ruthless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Power entangled becomes a monster. Overall, Emperor Qin is a majestic Greek tragedy. The attacker is evolving towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced into his destiny by love and his new ethics. This character is also very memorable. Lady Zhao, the beautiful Gong Li, is an intact morale, neither force nor love or hatred. He's morale against power, somehow like Antigone. Her conspiracy (for and against the emperor) always has a moral justification. Finally, it's a wonderful movie. If you like cinema and want to try Chinese movies, you can start here.
