I remember this movie he saw in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS and remembered it. While this obviously is not a "big budget" movie, acting is quite credible & scenery, locales, and costumes are very well done. I wish the mammoths were in more pictures, but when you see them, they're also well done (remember that SFX was done without the benefits of computers in those days, some poor devil really had to put all the hair and fake things) elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants in "Quest for Fire". Better than the average adventurous movie and chance for the star, Rod Cameron play something besides the cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.
