I saw this movie for the first time more than a year ago. I've seen it 4 times since then. I have never heard of it before and I consider myself a knowledgeable classic. Real, polished, rough diamond. This gem of the film revolves around Jon Voight (lead character "Conrack") as a young teacher who was assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the kids of the islands, all in one school. Initially, the students reveal that they know very little of the world behind their island home. The heart of the film is Conrack, who seeks inspiration to awaken his young minds to the world around them. Students quickly reward their teacher with eagerness to learn and the remarkable ability to understand the concepts that were strangers to them. Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that become, a little fun! God forbid. Learning and Fun? Together? He can't be, or he says the ones in charge. To avoid the spoiler, I'll just say that Conrack found resistance with the human boss ... and the end is really bittersweet. I'm a 35-year-old white man with some teaching experience, so I should identify myself with the lead character, Pat Conroy (aka, Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I don't identify with black children. As a child, I was in school at school on the other side of the city from 4th to 6th year, about 1979. These children then remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in grade 4 as 8 or 9 years old, one does not understand racism. I just remember we were all kids, we play 4-square, kickball, hiding and running relays. This film is very moving. There are wonderful and charming moments from start to finish, non-stop. Many times I found myself with tears in my eyes and then suddenly laughed out loud. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Git away from the wind!" .... "Sir, if you're ready to accept bullshit, I should tell you that rabbit did it in his lap." ... "" So, white teacher, Mr. Conrack. My grands LOVE Mr. Conrack. teacher, you good looking white man. "" ..... "winds 15 mph from small boats warn, small boats watch out big boats OK, don't worry you won't do anything. "..." not a fried cook, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a worker, but (something Latin) ... that's Latin .. they're waiting! "..." Conrack sings like a frog .... Do I sing well, what are you talking about? It's still mystifying me that I still can't hear anything about this movie, or that it has a very little or no reputation. I intend to look for more reviews, comments, backgrounds, and tidbits if they are Outside, what amazes me is acting by untrained children, one of the kids, Mary, I understand he's an actress, and you can say it, but the other kids have a lot of lines and real responses, I wonder how they did it! that Conrack and Mary had an exact dialogue they could work with while some scenes naturally developed or ad-libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. they are so good and so unknown.Other in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods must be crazy ('80) and Bad Day in Black Rock ('55). First of all, take a seat in Mr. Conrack's class.
