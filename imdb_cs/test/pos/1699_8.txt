This movie is not as bad as some say it is infact I think it's more fun than the original. Maybe that's why some people hate it so much because they don't want to admit it's a good (not big) movie. <br /> <br /> Most, if not all fx were made by CGI, I didn't mind at all because it was a nice movie. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was, in my opinion, the best guy in Julie Delpy's movie, rather appealing that she brought strangeness to the movie. There were a lot of movies in the movie that I thought was good. This movie is in my collection but the original isn't because I dont like it just like this. I wasn't bored when I watched this movie that I watched me unlike some horror movies that I could mention as oh say = killer killer & suspiria (movie Dario argento) this is a name but two. <br /> <br /> The ok werewolf movie should be in the folk collection if they like werewolf movies maybe I'll have the original at some point maybe. I have only one complaint and that is Phil Buckman - (Chris) was supposed to be more than that, but except that the movie was fine. <br /> <br /> Rating this movie 8/10 ok okwwolf movie there worst. <br /> <br />
