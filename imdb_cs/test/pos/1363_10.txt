Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes fell out. First: the part where he was to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking toilet water, while imagining he's a hot director giving him a golden shower !!! (So ​​I laughed!) <br /> <br /> The second part, where he tried to prove he's worthy of a swimming school instructor. He looked like a professional diving, but as expected, he couldn't swim (at least ^^). But the funny part was when he finally reached the end and said, "How it was" or something. It was so capricious that I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this anime series, I strongly recommend it. One of the best I've seen. Definitely fun!
