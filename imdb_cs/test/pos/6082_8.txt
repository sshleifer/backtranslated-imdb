One of the most graceful and at least the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghelly's fascinating Best Picture-winner of "The English Patient" is that in the mid-1990s, when Hollywood was in the early stages of losing its nerve for major new projects, a movie was created, which brought back traces of "mighty footprints" from the vast, magnificent majesty that created films like "Lawrence Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). The "English Patient" contains very much of what these films so powerful. It has that great feeling, elongated run that hardly looks long and fascinating characters with past and stories. "An English Patient", based on Michael Ondaatje's eponymous novel, is like "Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the way it is constructed. It is a mix of two stories: past and present, all revolving around the titular character: an English patient in the post-war years of World War II. Ralph Fiennes plays an English patient who has been destroyed by a plane crash throughout his life and was taken care of in a separate church by the only sister Juliette Binoche played beautifully. In addition to joining his hoarse, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger comes (Willem Dafoe) and both men know each other. <br /> <br /> Two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other, communicated in memory, is the patient's past before he was scarred and dying in bed. The story of the present mingled with the patient's past and his love affair, which forever changed his life. To be blunt, an "English patient" is a love story that mixes with a huge epic feeling. blends greatly. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate he was, how obsessed he was on the screen. Usually in love stories like Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), romantic elements seem to be more delicate than the obsession for me. Some of the love scenes have elements that may be more lusty than love, but because they are so well developed and not rushed and unused from proportions, we can believe that there is a certain, true love between them. these characters. It reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) in how creators and artists convinced us that they were two real human beings who really fell in love with each other. The performance all around was great. Especially I was excited about Juliette Binoche, who won the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Will Dafoe playing such a cynical, controversial character that is always important in playing. And of course I can't miss Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their depiction of two very passionate lovers. Despite my huge enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest to describe it as a perfect movie. There are two errors I can't look at. Number one, it's too long and the reason is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary partial tasks. I was not enchanted or interested in the second love story between Binoch and the bomb expert Naveen Andrews. My research led me to believe that this conspiracy element came from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly there, but in the movie it seems to be a little distracting and the relationship between the two characters wasn't fascinating me. I was much more interested in the character of Fiennes and his relationship with his two leading actresses. However, these two errors are easily forgiven, even though they slow down a bit. Postponed "English Patient" is an extraordinary success of filmmaking. For me, it was like a crazy laugh between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be a good value for my time. It's a pity that Anthony Minghella left us. He was really a talented filmmaker. That's all that someone needs.
