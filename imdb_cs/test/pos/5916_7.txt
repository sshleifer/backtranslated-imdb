From Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot), I see that this is a little underrated and underrated movie that can be seen. This is the biographical story of 'James Slim' Lindbergh (James Stewart), who wanted to be the first man in 1927 to cross a solo flight from New York across the Atlantic to get to Paris in a small cockpit. The first half hour or something Lindbergh sees to get permission to do so, and the construction of the aircraft, named "The Spirit of St. Louis", and making all the necessary preparations. The rest, of course, sees his dangerous journey that crosses the path, overcomes fatigue, loss of fuel, and moments of losing direction, but he has been successful. Also starring Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith as a Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson as Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite as Harry Knight, Sheila Bond as a model / dancer, Marc Connelly as Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Lindbergh seems to have been a little younger, so Stewart was too old to play, but then you can't think of anyone else who could do better. It's a funny and emotional drama when Stewart (as always) is a fantastic, great musical performance by Frank Waxman and a good direction from Wilder, which is a good known gem. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Special Effects (the only award it was ever nominated). James Stewart was number 12 on the 100 biggest movie stars, he was number 3 for 100 years, 100 stars - men, and he was number 13 in the world's largest actor. Very good!
