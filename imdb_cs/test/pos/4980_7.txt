Stanwyck with his best villain, Robinson Straight - equally ruthless baron in this fairly western. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes, strong use of location, color and Cinemascope. But why is the use of footage in the stampeded scene obvious? Ford is as reliable as ever, and Foster is as strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's a movie baddies'. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly crazy villain by Stanwyck's lover and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> See the camp's value.
