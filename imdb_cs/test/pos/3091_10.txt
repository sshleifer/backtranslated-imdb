It would be something that would try to tell someone that Fata Morgana is very simple about. Or maybe it is not: Herzog goes to the Sahara Desert and the surrounding villages to film diverse landscapes and locals. But that's just the widest stroke. It is a performance that you either give up or not. He gets into the world completely, without a story, tied only to certain aspects of written poetry, because his camera (filming on a supposedly discarded film store) travels as in pure travelogue. It might even jump to this easy conclusion by laying these vast lands, then moving to a coarser civilized culture (though not the "normal" culture itself) and to a level that is too abstract to properly convey. Sometimes it takes some time to approach purity through the "Creation" section, but the purity of how parts are manipulated by either nature or broken machines. Early storytelling, reading from Popol Vuh (which incidentally makes music for most of his films), with a gradual procession of truly very stylized footage adds a whole new level to it. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are what best matches Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", the pictures he has been on throughout his career. One wonders if the paintings end up, at a time when the second section, paradise, leads the words spoken, or if it is the other way around. You are the eyes moving together with farms and pans, and the wording is approaching religious writing, but there is also a selection of music, both bizarre replacement singing and low key classical music along with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think each side will end up bowing to the other, and it is something that still seems like * it shouldn't work. Perhaps it is to the fact that the chances of walking in a desolate wasteland and the smallest running stretches of any civilized life (in this case the huts of the desert) make it so fascinating. If it is just for cinematic meaning, it is a miracle for the viewer of occasional photography, too indescribable because it is a form of technique, and some of the strangest pictures of any Herzog movie. There are pans, there are long shots, there is hand-held while driving cities, there is a bus tens of kilometers away that across the mirage seems just a few, there is a full-on fire and a man holding a reptile and talking About his radar (a really classic gonzo comedy), there are people holding still in fake poses, and man and woman playing inane music. But most importantly, it will end up feeling, at least for me, natural for the personal nature of the approach. I'm sure only Herzog would know why he made the film, unlike simple "how"; He was already shooting Dwarves Started Little, and ended up going through many dangers to finish him. But this is what makes Fata Morgana so amazing performance - appealing to one depending on what someone is actually watching. It is certainly disturbing, but there is a temptation to want to see it again very soon afterwards, only to experience all the thoughts and reality that has turned into an abstraction of strange vibrations (yes, the word "vibration" applies here). It's one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
