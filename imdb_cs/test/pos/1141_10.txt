I went to this movie and I have no idea what to expect. I actually took it in theaters when it first came out. We both enjoyed it and helped us to see him after the interview. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing this movie only if you appreciate movies that aren't mainstream. It is not as incoherent as the Liquid Sky or as fantastic as the Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There's a lot of soft humor. Here's a brief summary of the conspiracy if you're completely lost: a big brother-type government keeps track of everything in society. Suddenly a new person appears and there is no data on it (it seems to be crazy). It may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The overly cautious government goes mad to find it and discover its true motives. The ruler is also obsessed with immortality. Some scenes are frantic, while others are totally weak. We follow a leading character when he meets all the different kinds of people in society. I didn't need my consciousness to change into a movie, but I know some of my friends felt it helped. Split was also filmed around Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
