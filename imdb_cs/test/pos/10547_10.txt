I love this movie, it's great and so fun, Ben is a FIT and I wouldn't mind if I met him on vacation !! I rate this movie 10 because of its gr8 and I hope it never does, because it would never be the same. The fun piece is wen Andre looks at the moon, and he screams at Nicole to "come out and look at the moon", which always makes me laugh and never gets old. Another thing is that Nicole looks much older than 14 ... but he's an actress gr8. But I need help with something Does n 1 not name the song played at the end of wen Nicole and Andre dancing ??? It's really bugging me because I want 2 not what it is because of its nice song !!
