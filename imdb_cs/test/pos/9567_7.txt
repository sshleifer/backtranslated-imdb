By 2002 I have some catching up. And when we look back at the faint year, the Best In Show shone. No big story. Little action. Just a cavalry of wonderful characters. A special reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a rattling pair of TV commentators. Great. Well worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (Showing 24Mar2001)
