I just finished the double night of the American werewolf in London and Paris. I start by saying "London" still holds after all these years and the sequence transformation is in every standard quite impressive, the film was funny, and scary, also a little gore .... Now get to "Paris" its pleasant, several scars , a lot of gore is not as exciting or scary as the original, but it has a few laughs in what has become quite fashionable these days, so maybe in the sense it was a time ago, al 'CGI transformations, while good for the technology of its time , they are nowhere near as impressive as the original. I gave this movie 7 because I have to admit it was nice, I laughed a lot and found out that Tom Everett Scott was so stupid that I didn't like to enjoy his performance just to enjoy it. Julie Delpy was competent as well as a direction that lacked a little shine and softness. I read here that John Landis was supposed to go wrong, that I wasn't quite sure it was a completely different movie. I also noticed some discussion about Sequel "What if" well no one noticed that it should be in America and here is my title "Werewolf is coming home" or in DC that would be fun, all those political dogs need good scare. You just have to see the original in his new DVD transmission with Dolby 5.1 sound and see both of them on HDTV with upconvert on ... nice !!!!
