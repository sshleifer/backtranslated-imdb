I absolutely like this show !!!!!!!, Its basically a fox is a better version of the simpsons (cau'se allows you to face the simpsons are very dry if you're over age 9. It's political, irrational and irresistible Anyone says that they do not like being lying, it is for every character, Peter, Stewie and Quagmire are my favorite Peter because he is rude, unpleasant and simply does not give crap out of his amazing intelligence and how he will hit you with what an adult would say When you least expect it, and hoarse because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes and an episode for everyone, Mr. Griffin leaves for Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3), if you like more sexual and physical humor, the issue is impossible (VOL .2 SEASON 3.) Or if you like any other kind of humor, it's a damned Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2). Basically what I'm saying is that when you look at this show, there's a split for everyone humor GI GGITY GOOOOO!
