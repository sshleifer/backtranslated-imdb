Pink Flamingos: The Past Past Representation <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing depiction of the negative impact of traumatized childhood on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very typical house. Regardless, you see the impact it has on society through its actions until the end, when it absorbs dog excrement. Was this film just a sick and twisted perversion of endless intestinal fluctuations, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? To the first side would be an easy way out, and the other side might seem demented, but perhaps true. The film has some credible resemblance to the real events of our social past. Every leader we, as humans, consider to be "horrible," has similar qualities as Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Staling had "disturbing" childhood. Babs Johnson had a troubling childhood, and therefore he is associated in the same class as all previous rulers. That is why many of her actions can be perceived as disturbing throughout the film. But her actions were her own guilt or company that she let her grow up as she did. In addition, each character in this film represents either a past leader or an event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind it can be linked to genocide and Hitler's attempt to destroy the Jews. Some see Hitler as a genius, another mad man. John Waters had to see him as a mad man because Edith's representation was really insane. Edith's son Crackers and companion on the road Cotton are a symbol of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent the time period most of us would forget. These characters are key to pointing out that at some times our society in America was no better than what we often consider to be terrible acts of social onslaught in other cultures. King f ** the royal scene is the embodiment of what was bad in our society at this time and is still bad. Chicken, is a 1970 slang term for a woman. Therefore, it may be possible that John Waters attempted to refute the rape issue through Cotton and Crackers. The antagonist family was marble if one antagonist could be identified in this film. Marble is often mentioned in connection with wealth. This can therefore be a symbol of the struggle between the poor and the rich, which continues to this day and is likely to continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes, but it should also be recorded for its masked political agenda, which Waters displayed so richly in its entirety.
