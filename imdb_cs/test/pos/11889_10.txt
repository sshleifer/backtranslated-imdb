El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really kicking his ass. This film, with its great cast - Damian Chapa (Blood in Blood Out), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many others - is the best SCARFACE gangster. A movie that everyone MUST see. 2 hours full of action with fantastic incredible sensation !!!! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We are waiting impatiently for Part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Keep up the good work !!! I loved it !!
