When we saw the feature film Kieslowski made from this episode "The Decade" years ago, he returned to this viewer when we watched ten medals. As with other films, this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "you will not kill". Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writes with Kryzzztof Piesewicz, looked at the mind of a young man committing a vile crime of murdering an innocent man to distract himself. This installment has a Dostoevsky character who has always reminded us of "crime and punishment", or at least some of the characteristics of the novel are passed on to the aimless young man who apparently has no redeemable qualities. The story shows a young man wandering the city streets without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only gentle moment he sees is when he visits the photographer's place and asks for his sister's old image to be restored. Kieslowski is left to fate for a killer to take a taxi with the intention of robbing a driver, but it's his anger and frustration that get the best of that youth to kill a man who doesn't deserve to die. The last moments of this criminal are one of the most enjoyable sequences in any film, past or present. Another element of the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing can prevent a court from condemning a young man to death. At the end, the lawyer feels that he has failed his client and goes to the judge to find out where he went wrong. The young man asks him to get the picture and send it to his mother. Kieslowski's description of how he interprets the Fifth Commandment creates a surprising film that remains in the viewer's mind for a long time. after this episode is forgotten.
