I saw two hands back in Sydney a few years ago and immediately became one of my favorite movies. It's action, adventure, comedy and romance, all rolled into one (and a little zen tossed to a good extent). Like many Australian movies, this story is easy to follow, but beautifully involved, and Jordan is proud of its work. Anyway, it was on TV right now on Channel 4 in London and my two favorite comedy scenes not only from this movie, but from the real movie, were cut out! So if you're watching this movie, make sure it's the original version.
