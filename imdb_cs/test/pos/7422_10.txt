Terry and June in my mind is all the time classic, along the lines with the blessing of this house with late Sid James and the late Diana coupon, but Terry Scott will unfortunately be missed even though he died in 1994. I have all the dvd upto press and I am looking forward to get all 9, it would also be nice to see "happy after all" released on dvd <br /> <br /> June whitfield is still strong and terry scott will always live in my memory terry scott rip not many comedies today that i think will stay in the legend list and yes middle class bit to get on some nations wicks but don't mind i think it would be brilliant to see some terry scott life celebrations
