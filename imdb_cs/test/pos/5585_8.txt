I have seen this film as a child about 30 years ago, and I have not forgotten it to this day. I couldn't tell if it was a good picture. But in those days I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. Memories focus on the very erotic feeling of the film, but I still remember the storyline. At that time, Simmons was very young and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: David Lean is great expectations. And again it was young Jean Simmons. It is a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I want to fix my memories ...
