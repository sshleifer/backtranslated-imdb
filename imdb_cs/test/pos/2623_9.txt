When I saw only once and at dawn, I can't forget this scary movie. A mixture of mystery, tension and heartbreaking romance reminds me of Vertigo. Actors, though not so well known, are especially good at Joan Hackett in one of his best performances. In her, in her love, you believe in her newfound path the freedom her love has brought to her, and ultimately her overwhelming pain. The storyline is sophisticated and convincing and does not extend credibility. The direction and technical issues could certainly be better, but they do not jeopardize the overall effect. And he has one message: don't get revenge, you can become his last victim. A real pity that it wasn't overworked, but maybe it's a piece of the better that remained alone.
