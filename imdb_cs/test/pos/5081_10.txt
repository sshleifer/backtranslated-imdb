I think it was the most prominent thriller I've ever seen. The film's research was thorough, the writer Kelly Sane left no loose ends. The cast was seasoned (a fantastic show all around). Omar Metwally was excellent. Cinematography is poetic, enchanting music and the overall effect is highly satisfying. Rendering goes to a territory that even the media is afraid of treading. It's really a wake-up call for those dealing with espionage and a legal site that is "war on terror". The woman came out of the theater and asked me, "So it really happened"? This alone speaks of Gavin Hood's masterful success.
