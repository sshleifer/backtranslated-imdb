And what is his genre? The backstage reveals the story; what is theatrical life really like for those Broadway curtains (and more). He certainly has a lot of competitions: Singin 'in Rain I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (You Name Year.); Dames of 1934; Sounds Off (1992) from farcical page and star is born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s from tragic party: not to mention Summer Supplies 1950: list holds rollin 'along. What makes this movie so special? And why is there so few comments about this stunning movie? Did so few people see it? How amazing to see younger Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon 30 years old! How amazing it is to see fresh and talented Tom Hulce so pre-Amadeus! And another great Stiller! What a wonderful line-up of talented people in their best of time! And such a scenario! Who was David Shaber? So full of realistic disillusionment and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feeling of good comedy! Particularly illustrated by the Star-Is-Born episode, where the heroine reaches Broadway, while Langell's character has to settle for yet another provincial tour. Langell's subsequent hysterical and sadistic wound against the stars struck a Latin teacher and his granddaughter, in which his fury and frustration radiate, is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (Latin teacher and his love affair with backstage life will certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and her seductive professor in the Blue Angel of 1929.) Another of mercenaries and cold-blooded agents like Kevin McCarthy, preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Fragrance of Success (1957) and followed by Alan Aldo in Clubland (2001) in film history. The sexual liberation of the Hulce character resembles similar incidents in the great comedy O'Neill Ah, Wilderness. And what a tribute to the vanished operetta long ago: Red Herbert's Red Mill; Rose Marie and Vagabond King of Rudolf Friml; Sigmund Romberg's Desert Song, etc. What satirical inserts of pieces from big games like Romeo and Juliet. Tribute to the theater itself, as Langella star exposes. The richness and depth of this film are simply endless. And be so saddled with this title! Who could have a clue about what a great movie of such a ridiculous and unsuccessful title is? But on the other hand, what kind of title could someone apply to such a wonderful drama that could live up to its mixing, emotional content? PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in her last spectacular: like Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years goes from triumph to triumph!
