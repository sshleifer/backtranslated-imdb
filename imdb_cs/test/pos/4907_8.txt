"Four Daughters" introduced John Garfield to the audience, and that's what he remembers most about this film today. Unlike some actors who appear in several movies in front of their pictorial image gels, Garfield immediately established his cigarette with his mouth and talked about the fates that are against him. It's actually a story of four girls, their widowed musician father (Claude Rains) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, plays handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He's the one everyone's in love with, but he's in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then he meets the ne'er-do-well Mickey Borden, who also falls on her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. It is a fairly formal story of life (and continuation) of acting. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was by far the most powerful of the daughters, the most interesting, and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking leading man, and he got him on his right foot with the Warners. But the real star was not. Like many others at the time, he went into service, and when he came out, he had a bronze star but not much of a career. Later he went to television and real estate. Claude Rains is warm and fabulous as a patriarch. So popular was "Four Daughters", which inspired "Four Wives" and "Four Mothers", as well as reuniting most casts in "Daughters" Courage where actors played different characters. <br /> Very pleasant, nice memory of simpler and probably happier times and possibility to see John Garfield in his first movie.
