That was a really interesting Halloween movie. I wasn't thrilled with the whole Thorn theory, but it still makes a good movie. I liked seeing Tommy Doyle, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died right after filming. The film had a really bad director who didn't flip about the show, from what I heard when I treated Donald wrong, and I wouldn't want to allow Danielle Harris to return as Jamie. It's like trying to destroy the movie, but I still liked it. There have been lots of cuts and music changes and if you are lucky you can get Producers Cut, which represents more than 40 minutes. never before scenes. With these scenes he turns into a whole new film. See if you have a chance.
