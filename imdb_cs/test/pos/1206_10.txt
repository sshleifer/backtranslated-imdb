I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I watch this movie it is just as fun as it was for the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of the sixties against war "hippies" living in New York. This small group takes place on a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who was sent to the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite his best efforts to deter him, Claude finally reports on basic military training. The hippie group, who is still desperate to leave them, steals a car and travels the US to visit Claude "... for a few hours," by George Berger (to the MP located at the entrance of the Army Base Claude is temporarily in Nevada). The result is really moving, so I won't harm him for those who haven't seen this fantastic movie yet. Music score is just as fantastic! Don Dacus (Chicago rock band), who plays the role of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the film would not be the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, an uptown girl who is related to hippies) is sensational in her role! MUST SEE A Movie !!
