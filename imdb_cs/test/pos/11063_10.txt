I grew up in New York and every afternoon ABC showed 4:30 - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remembered as a child. I loved this movie and stayed with me for years. I recently watched it and I still thought it was great - maybe I'm just romantic - but I thought it was good. I don't mean to say that this film was good only for the main actors - I really didn't know who they were when I first saw this movie - I think I knew that quality works like a child. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially liked to see old New Orleans during this film. If you ever get a chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies that show the city at that time - when you get to some old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or uptown, you can really imagine the life it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this is a good movie for me!
