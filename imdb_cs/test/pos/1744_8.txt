This is a very modest, very beautiful movie with an excellent score of Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a winning number, which is a totally evocative period and returns to the Penthouse Serenade, as well as the introduction premise to inspire Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody Coming) in the Finnish Rainbow Final six years later. I totally agree with those posters that have noticed that the name Disney has been added to this name, which has so far achieved a "classic" position rather than being neglected. It's amazingly inventive, never more than when objects scarcely recorded in the "real" world are of much greater importance - both for and in the world of insects. Actually, it's classic, though smaller.
