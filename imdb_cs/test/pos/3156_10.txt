USA The film is as follows: You take a nap on a long hot Sunday afternoon. It's great to close your eyes and let your worries go away. You will soon be lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you are dreaming, but you still can't wake up - not that you want to. You go with the flow, and soon you are in some strange story of Alice in Wonderland, full of characters you didn't think you could imagine. It tells you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace, and also guides you on the way to the past and even to the future. The dream is getting harder and you feel that it is going down the road you can't control. Maybe you wanna wake up, so you're trying to open your eyes, but you can't. Now it is destruction and sadness and confusion and frightening voices that tell you what might be true or might be lies. Do you see images that flicker and change and then get clear, but do you want to see what the brain creates for you? Finally you are lost in the mythical world and you realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's end. What do you wake up? What do you do next? You may want to write that dream because you know that dreams don't happen too often - and when you pay more attention. Or maybe you fill the beer and forget the whole thing. Bad idea. Do not forget.
