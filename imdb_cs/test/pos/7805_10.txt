There are some movies that are loved by almost anyone you encounter, and yet they become box office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and cheerful comedy, falls into this catogory. The Indian director once remembered the sensitivity of the audience and did not make Kader Khan-type stereo fraud. The film is about two guys who dream of wealth and try to do this by learning about a millionaire's daughter. A funny drama unfolds in the story, while a lot of complexity appears on the surface. Complexity contributes to the complete comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays a street smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as a stupid guy. Villian played Paresh Rawal, and his followers, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the film borrows from many other films, through a flimsy cameraman, and despite being "loud" occasionally, it remains one of the rare "humorous" movies of Bombay came with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies Sadly, the box office did not do well, because it means that manufacturers will return to formulas and creativity is abandoned.
