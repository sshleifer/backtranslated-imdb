This is a nice little lifetime film about a guy (Peter Coyote) who lives a perfect life in a suburban middle class when they suddenly burst into his home and arrest him for murdering a guy 27 years ago. In his prison cell, Coyote depicts his wife a fateful event 27 years ago and how he came into contact with Wayne Kennedy the man he allegedly killed. From here the story is told in a flashback fashion and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when you got more interested in it. The guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary enough. The real strength of the film is the secret of what actually happened on the mountain. A woman spends the movie running around kicking up a trail of mystery and every time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more secrets. It's actually pretty good. <br /> <br /> As for the lifetime television movie, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
