British Australian helmer Alex Frayne urges his attention to his strange need, which requires careful reading, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man unable to control the drastic change of personality prompted by the death of a close relative pico offers a fascinating exploration of human psychology. Distributed by Accent-Australia. John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern city to take care of their deceased uncle. (Don Barker) Ownership. While Emily and Edward sign up for a local hotel, John asks the locals about the death of Uncle Tom - some say he committed suicide, some don't want to talk. Confused John comes up with his own theory - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hiding in the adjacent bushes. If not for the occasional line of dialogue that serves to release his heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have been easily confused with the movie Sokurov. The 16mm camera image is a faded color scheme strangely evoking the reflexes of the Russian director into human agony. Perhaps it is no coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love premiered. But looking at the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visual imagery, it reveals a somewhat different picture - Socurian films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point of deliberately separating the main protagonists from the environment by everything She is directed by her preferred yellow color, wrapping herself in a big splash of the director's preferred yellow, modern love, which feeds a lot on the Australian landscape. Its gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it, and the more the story progresses, the more obvious it is that nature is an integral part of Frayne's vision. In Sokurov's Second Circle, a young man returns to Russia to bury his late father. In the shack where the old man once lived, everything is covered with dust. Gathering some old clothes scattered all over his body, he puts his father's body in the coffin. Then they say goodbye and bury it. The rest of the film is a long-standing reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, loneliness and dissatisfaction that many people have dealt with. In modern love, somewhat ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly attacks John's life. Unlike the Second Circle, however, the main protagonist has the opportunity to embrace his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but he leaves. Slowly but surely, the presence begins to crumble under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. I doubt Frayne designed for Modern Love to be so strikingly similar to the one Sokurov did in the Second Circle. Yet, the pace, and especially the mysterious framing, is exactly what turns this film into an almost meditative experience - a difficult and extremely fragile approach to the deconstruction of human psychology that these two directors have mastered to perfection. Mark Constable brings top performance because John adds even more depth to his highly demanding character. His facial expressions are excellent. Victoria Hill and William Traeger blend perfectly with their tense visual style performance.
