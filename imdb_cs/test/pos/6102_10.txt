He was just watching this movie on TV and it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Just planned to watch it while doing some work, but I ended up watching the whole movie with out doing the job as it was so good! Actors who are not very well known, but the story is important for that. The fact that actors are less well known makes it more plausible that events may occur. I did not feel the bias towards one character because I have no judgment about the types of characters I have ever seen of any of the actors in the film that would make it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> recommended watching it.
