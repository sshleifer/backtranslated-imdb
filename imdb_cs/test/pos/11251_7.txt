I'm from Texas and I live very close to Plana, where there was a real death, so I might be a little bit concerned that I said "Wasted" is a movie you just can't get out of your head. Stahl, Phoenix and Paul play their characters very realistically. You really believe that they are high school students who are just addicted to heroin. The content of drugs is also processed very graphically - although everything that happens in the film serves the purpose, and every moment the spirals continue downward, they are heartbreaking. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. As soon as you watch it, they stick with you!
