Genius or total madness? It depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to this at the level of a self-confident "parody of the film," and I sincerely hope it was the intention because I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Does this film mean Rudd's departure from his background in the comedy genre? Any crazy attempt to rediscover it as a tough action star? I think not! With cheesy, almost awkward acting, low budget FX, and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it all a little evoked that old TV show "Sledge Hammer" for me! HILARIOUS!!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course I completely misunderstood the movie. If it was in fact an attempt to 'straight' action movie, then it was certainly a fun failure !! Watch with lots of alcohol and some friends !!! ;-)
