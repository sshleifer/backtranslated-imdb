Madonna gets into action again and fails again! Who is this girl was released just one year after the huge flop of Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult film Desperately Seeking Susan. She decided to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie, without thinking it could be a flop. The film received bad acceptance by an American critic and audience, while in Europe it was a success. Madonna says "Some people don't want her to be successful as a pop star or movie star". The four-track soundtrack album sells well and the title-track single was an agreat hit worldwide as well as the World Tour. The truth is, Madonna failed as an actress because the script was pretty weak. Butit is not so bad, especially for those who like the 80s: it's such a shabby, garbage, colorful and joyful action movie! In the end it's very fun to watch.
