An excellent and moving story about the end of a uniquely intimate affair. Then again is the point of the film, paraphrasing another note that any relationship can be unique and intimate. A truly high quality short film that caught me on my busiest, but had the power to pull me out on the sofa and watch, solid and quiet, for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are powerful moving characters, and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film a defamatory exercise. In addition, the film within the film 'idea plays very well with this cast and is quite riveting, though in a somewhat melancholic manner.
