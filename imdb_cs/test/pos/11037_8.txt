If you are very sensitive about extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are very interested in seeing a rare piece of war animation, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye patrols the sea and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. Two Japanese fishermen deceived Popeye to think they wanted to sign a peace treaty. However, appearance may be misleading; fishing boat turned out to be a Japanese naval ship! What follows is today considered to be a morale-promoting propaganda. Be warned that the representation of the Japanese in the film is done in the spirit. However, keep in mind that there was a war at that time. But I strongly recommend this caricature to those who are interested in the World War II era.
