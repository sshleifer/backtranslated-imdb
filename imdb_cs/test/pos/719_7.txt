To this year this movie: nice for television, but too small for theater. I liked to watch this movie at home, but I did watch it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the movie is just a summary. The end had a "nice" twist, but still not satisfied. Maybe it was the director's intention, but it wasn't as it should be. But then it's a good kind of movie.
