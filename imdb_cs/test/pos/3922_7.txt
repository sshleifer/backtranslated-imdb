Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad boy brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her friend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to another cities to look at an important game. They decide to be halfway in the camp and continue the next day. However, Wade's fan belt breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town where the wax house is. When they arrive, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two former Siamese former brothers have transformed people into wax sculptures. I liked the "Wax House", a really valuable teen horror movie. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash movies, and it's well done, has a good team of actors and actresses, and special effects and death scenes are amazing. While the movie wasn't good, watch the sexy and superb Paris Hilton. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Casa de Cera" ("House of Waxes")
