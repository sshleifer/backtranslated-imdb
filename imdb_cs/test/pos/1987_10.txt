The producers of this painting are Hungarians. It is not the crazy momentum that X and Z have in mind of the headlines that the word "isten" means "god" in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is a word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that right? Let's take a look at this film as a science-fiction sibling "The History of Violence". Both films have the same power to throw out the genres; 2005 thriller and drama and 'no FX-ed as hell' sci-fi at the one we're looking at right now. Everything he does has meaning and is surrounded by details: A nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In The Days of Perky Pat") by creating a "Perky Pat" fast food restaurant. Nodding to Stanley Kubrick using 2001's naming pattern; as IBM became the HAL (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in eXistenZ 'The Classic Lubricant Spray' WD-40 becomes the XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra clears the Pikul port. Nodding to David Cronenberg with a witty kind of Videodrome ('Death ...' and 'Long Life') and accepting another medium for the central theme of the picture (TV in Videodrome, Video Game and Virtual Reality in eXistenZ 1999 you are in the game, welcome to Canada!) A nod of good taste, when Peter Suschitzky, Howard Shore music and Ronald Sanders cut (the team to win). For anyone born in the early 1980s with super famicom, genesis or arcade wand in hand, this movie rings. Nodding enough. Plot? "Jennifer Jason Leigh acts as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that gets into the minds of the players, as we see on the movie's main page, a story in the story. For me, this picture of a young couple of" protesters reality " who infiltrates the presentation of a "brand new virtual game" to destroy his programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality if it is like reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh always plays in the game she is in , the game designer and at the end of the movie is reality, with video games with insane giggles, big furry dogs, "Cronenberg's realistic" plastic textures (helmets and things) and 9mm handguns. (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ), in which JJL plays ingenious programmer eXistenZ and Jude -Pikul - law of marketing slingshot tactics associated with Allegra), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about the health of his pod (the thing you plug into your nervous system to play), he has to get involved and Pikul then wins (Transcendenz) and actually kills Yevgeny Nourisha, programmer of TranscendenZ. Playing <br /> Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is in the face of your essence, in the face of your subconscious, while its virtual reality will have to overcome unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegro, 'reality demonstrator' turns into Allegra, 'goddess of virtuality'). What game would Heidegger play to feel his abstract da-sein term? To really engage in the world? And what about Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe means to him - God, Mecanic -) ??? Yes, we are building a story for ourselves and losing this thread, which we follow from one day to another crumbling people as personalities; eXistenZ discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of oneself by everyone who has truly captured it. And sometimes we could get some neat things; actually perceiving virtuality in reality.
