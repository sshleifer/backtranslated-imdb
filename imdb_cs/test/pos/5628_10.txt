Whenever I don't give 150% of my dreams or my goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, who is a real American film theme. Mark's persistent persistence in filming and filming the first feature film is so captivating that you will laugh, shake your head with sadness and take root. This honest documentary has not seen the film about R. Crumb ever since. The supportive "cast" (Mark's real family and friends) are great. Give this movie a chance and you'll see a great movie and a wonderful portrait of what the American dream is made of.
