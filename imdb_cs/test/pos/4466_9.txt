I tend to get angry when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he is categorized as not talented filmmakers, only to shock and disgust the entire audience with images of pure gore. It is true that his films contain more dirt and disease than average mainstream American production, but his films are always of a wide spectrum and the conspiracies are terribly morbid. There is no torture duckling is another story! This movie is a pure gem of Italian shock! Perhaps I dare to call this film a masterpiece - it's an old-fashioned giallo that embraces all the brilliant aspects of true horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 young boys are found, terribly mutilated. There are a lot of pseudo-madmen in the city, but every path goes nowhere. Among the suspects are a greedy ass and a scary woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. Fulci, like a real master, knows that he will find the right spooky tone for his film. The small town portrays it as a claustrophobic and inherent environment for scary events supported by a dizzying soundtrack. Fulci is also developing as a brilliant narrator. The scenario is always one step ahead and a complex plot introduces you more than once. In other words, this is a unique giallo (the mystery of the horror murder). Gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit as in the later Lucia lovers (among them the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and New York Ripper), although there are still a few uncomfortable and hard-to-follow shock sequences. . Don't Let Torture Duck is the Most Compelling and Effective Success Lucio Fulci has ever brought and is one of the largest Italian horror movies ever made. Right next to masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from start to finish, some aspects of the plot are alarming realistic and the tension is constantly adrenaline! You need to see horror fans and absolute priority for Italian shock lovers!
