(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A film that is almost designed to stop you and check its memory - it is limited to an almost empty motel, where a huge courtyard resembles a circus circle and rooms seem to be temporary places rather than refuges; as the characters are increasingly interested in the past, the presence becomes more and more absent until the earnest appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes does not mean the combination of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true or not, and whether Stanton is truly a father or just a crazy old man who has entered their stories, it is impossible to determine. It seems to be about how the love of extreme and unrecognized nature moves with stability to the point that reality itself breaks down; where exotic, lost fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of a burning motel - a symbol of dislocation struck by destruction - is a peculiarly strange end to this strange but effective, surprisingly imaginative film.
