I think this movie was made in the year I was born. I believe that people still have their constitutional rights, now in the name of "internal security". Thinking that this film was intentionally banned by the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses political differences in the United States better than any film I've ever seen. If it were much wider, would it change anything? A film like this is so polarizing it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you and makes you stand up. Is it a problem for you: are you in favor of people's right to disagreement in times of war, or that the constitution is threatened in the name of "national security"? The protagonists are forced by the government to race the American flag in a game that undermines the very ideals for which the flag stands. Acting is absolutely convincing. So much, I don't see any acting happenings here at all. If it's a documentary script, it's more convincing than any reality TV show today. PUNISHMENT PARK is perhaps the most important film ever made. You really think.
