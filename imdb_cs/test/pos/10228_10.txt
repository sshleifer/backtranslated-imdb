I'd like to see a tie between NightBreed, The Fury, and X-Men Series, how the second Outer Limit series would follow up on stories and conspiracies after story arc, even though it was never intended. I would also like to know if there is any additional information - unofficial or other - about the relationship and / or cooperation between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I can't imagine David Cronenberg appearing as a mere actor in Clive Barker. Are there any other information about the subject? Finally, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and I was hoping it would be a sequel. Does anyone know if there were any plans for production that never came to fruition, or are there plans to continue?
