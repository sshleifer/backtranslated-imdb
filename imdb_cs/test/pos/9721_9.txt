his years since I saw these shows. I was looking for years for anyone who saw them or knew something about them. I thought I invented them. I remember most soldier and death. I would ask film fanatics if they saw them, mentioned that it was Jim Henson and people didn't know it yet. These are great fables. I was very young when I was these, not even 10 and left a lasting impression on my life and faith. I would recommend to anyone to watch them, just remember they are from the 80s so they don't look like movies today. Give them a chance. Jim Henson overtook his time and died prematurely.
