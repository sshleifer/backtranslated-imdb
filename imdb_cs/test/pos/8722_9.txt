This is a totally charming movie. The cast is amazing and the story is funny and fun. A pleasant film experience all around. Although the storyline is somewhat predictable, the story doesn't make it less entertaining, in fact I didn't want it to end. I've always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman and I was interested in seeing her in a comedy role. She has not let go of me, the production of Ingrid Bergman as Mrs. Dickinson is fun to watch. I loved her interaction with Toni in the music store as well as her dance and made "dentist". It just proved what I already knew is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also happy to watch. Her fun, dear and sweet Toni is the driving force behind the film. You don't even question why she would worry about her wife Finacee, you just agree that he's just the kind of person who wouldn't be happy if she knew the others were all. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never give the viewer the feeling of hostility, in fact they will almost endure him. There was no incomprehensible character in the book. This movie has stood the test of time, I just watched it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for fun, cheerful, romantic comedies, don't look any further.
