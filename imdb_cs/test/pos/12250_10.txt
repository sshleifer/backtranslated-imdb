Not only was it the best 1987 movie, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best movies I've ever seen. For some reason, I really connected with this film and it's one of the most personal movies I've ever seen in my life (26 years). For better or worse, I have strongly identified myself with Holly Hunter (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely clear, loyal and intense woman who has failed to figure out romantic relationships. There were so many things in the film that she said in this movie that it would be something I would say or say to others in similar circumstances. And I consider the end of the film very, very sad. Of course, this role was a big break for Holly Hunter. Of course, I wasn't the only one who thought so seriously.
