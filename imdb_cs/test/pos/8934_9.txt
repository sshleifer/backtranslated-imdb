I always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Betty Business" wasn't disappointing. I saw it on a satellite in a grim Sunday morning. Life was stressful, and this movie made me laugh and saw things we usually consider frantic. I wish she did more movies like this and "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl nearing 60 to see in action. She is cute, beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and fake. Not many actresses are there for us to apply to them in a realistic but comical and / or serious way. Brenda - if you see it - continue with such gems. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
