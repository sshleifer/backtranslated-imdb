I have read the above comment and can't believe it! Of course his children's film, his adaptation of the children's book !! This movie is easy to grab, try play.com or amazon and its very easy to get a copy! Jokes are fun for kids and adults and adventure is pure without violence! It is perfectly suitable for children of all ages! Songs are fab, and yes, a little repetitive, but that's what kids need, and while watching, my little ones heard singing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, the story of innocence and friendship! Very beautiful and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages!
