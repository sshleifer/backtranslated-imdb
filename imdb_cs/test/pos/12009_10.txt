I grew up outside of Germany (where they landed), every detail of the film was 100% authentic, power lines that flew over, nasal neighbors, grandmother who told the kids they couldn't watch western German television, etc. This film brings many good memories to those who are European, great Disney production ... The same film in German Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner use their own voices to translate the English version into German ... The German version also uses Cookoo birds, a bird native to Germany as background noise, to tell you that you are in Germany. I showed this move to many of my German relatives and they really liked this movie. they made a prototype balloon they had to give up because the materials they used were too porous and another 2 balloons used to escape. The burner problem has been resolved when the propane bottles have turned upside down.
