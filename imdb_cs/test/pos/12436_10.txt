This film was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the funniest, coolest, most damaging piece ever made. It just couldn't go wrong with the cast of the excellent British actors character boasting. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-ditto, a beautifully harsh, innocent Gossage, played to perfection Imperial Joyce Grenfell. Caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (Guy Middleton Special) and the rest of the staff summarize England's post-war middle class on the tee. Humor is sometimes obvious, but it's a special "Ealing" variety and it's never offensive. I've watched this movie more than I care about and still laugh like drainage. The concern of the dorms occupied by the girls' school, the beautifully planned but ultimately convicted twins after school and the chaotic ending involving the arrival of the third school to anarchy are invaluable. It's an old clich√© I know, but they won't do it anymore. How I wish. If you haven't seen it, please don't be disappointed.
