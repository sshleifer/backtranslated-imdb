As a Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the comments of other reviewers, EXCEPT that I feel that "Crazy Crazy" was his best sound film; "Cat's paw" is close. (But this is just my opinion). This film is "hoof" from start to finish and in many scenes, George Barbier (the cheater that gives him the elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the movie). One would like the character of Una Merkel to be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially when the film continues. Only in the last few minutes of the film can we find her real feelings for him. (And then not "romance" - kissing, etc.). This is Must-See!
