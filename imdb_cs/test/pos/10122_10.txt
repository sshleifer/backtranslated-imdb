As one who often goes to movies, I have to say that this was one of the most impressive movies I saw this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. they have shown excellent performances that have allowed viewers to get lost in different emotions and feelings for characters. It's nice sometimes to see a movie that's not entirely dependent on special effects, but it allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche at many levels. I wish Hollywood would make more films of this caliber.
