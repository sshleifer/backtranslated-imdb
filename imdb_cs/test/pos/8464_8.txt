I went to see this movie out of curiosity and settle the argument. The film is now the most famous of the music ensemble of Sergei Prokofiev, who has made it to his film since his random music. The general outline of the plot is well known from sleeve notes on various records. An official randomly generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the Emperor. The Tsar is interested in this person, and he did not tell him that there is no, but the courtiers and officers claim to be real. Kizhe is deported to Siberia, remembered, promoted, married, promoted again, dying, given a state funeral, revealed as embezzlement, and posthumously degraded into ranks. I heard contradictory stories about how an official invented Kizhe, including ink stains and sneezing, but I heard the movie was lost, so it was impossible to figure out what would happen. Then the film appeared in the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that everything that happens is that the clerk confuses two words when writing an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. Since the line is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to fix the error. When I was waiting for historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is very funny and the audience, including me, was always laughing. Although most of it is filmed straight, set mostly in the palace, there are a few "trick" shots where more images appear on the screen. For example, the Imperial army is represented by a small group, repeated over the screen. Four identical guards perform the perfect drill in perfect connection. Two identical servants scrub the floor. One of the minor drawbacks was that it was very hard to figure out who it was. They were two women who could be daughters of the tsars, a daughter and a servant, or something else. And very few people have been named. All in all, a fun movie and I'm surprised we don't see it more often.
