Annie Rooney lives with her officer's father and brother Tim in New York slums, where she is constantly involved in many fights with other neighboring children. Annie secretly has a crush on Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is the head of a gang that Annie is constantly fighting) who is in a gang that is heading for trouble, says Rooney officer. Kelly sponsors a dance where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to deal with him for looking like a fool in front of his girlfriend, but officer Kelly gets a fatal injury instead. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) Tony and Spider's friend said Kelly shot his father so he goes after him for revenge. Annie learns about it and stops her brother if he's on time. A very good mix of humor and heart in this movie, even if the storyline doesn't start up to 40 minutes of movie mark. Pickford is pleasant (though she was 33 girls not more than 12-13) and really gets into her character. Haines doesn't play Kelly as hard as he should, but he can feel it on an emotional level. The scenes in which the officer tells Annie about the death of his father and the end, actually threw a piece into your throat. The mixture of all kinds of kids throughout the movie is fun to watch. Rating, 8.
