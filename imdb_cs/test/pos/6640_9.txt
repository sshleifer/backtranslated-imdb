This is one of Bergman's most horrible, scary movies I've ever seen. I also think it is one of the strongest films about the ugliness of war and what it does to human souls. A few musicians who have left the big city on a remote island and have done Living as farmers find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful deeds that would usually be impossible to imagine for them because they are trying to survive the terrible reality of war. They will betray their souls, their friends and even themselves in a desperate attempt to simply survive the next day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual, lost, confused and frightened, caught in the midst of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
