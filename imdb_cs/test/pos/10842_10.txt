This is one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series has brought joy and sadness to true love. Being planted in the 18th century was an amazing view of lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women. The cast was above expectations! Rachael Stirling is an amazing actress, I've never seen her other works, but her portrayal of Nan has made me join her and feel her pain and love. The most important thing is to connect with characters in anything I watch. If anyone has any doubts about the movie being seen ... Think twice! This is a must see series. Good work with the BBC! We need more lesbian movies that portray true love and hurt like this. I live in Canada I have imported this DVD and I am so excited to buy it.
