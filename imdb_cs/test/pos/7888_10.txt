After a recent look, Cry Uncle, from the same director, I decided to look for it and I'm glad I did it! It's an extremely good movie. Far, far better than it would have given the ingredients. How many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone who plays the middle class Dad who mixes her with aagh! And yet, thanks to the perfect scenario, it's believable. It's not ideal, not good or bad, but believable. Peter Boyle, as a working class, hippie and ni ** er hater and Dennis Patrick as a seductive suit, play their parts perfectly and I can't remember when I saw these two classes come together like that without being sentimental. Susan Sarandon is as effective as a hippie cat, but she doesn't have everything to do in her first movie. That is indeed, he must see the film capture, as it does a very short period in Western and especially in the US when the counter culture was about to break open itself.
