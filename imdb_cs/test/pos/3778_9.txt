This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released into theaters in the late 1950s under the title "Chaplin Review". This was a strange movie in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was an anti-war and his films emphasized peace and fraternity. On the contrary, this film is a propaganda comedy that aims to support US efforts in the First World War. It's really strange to see Charlie as a "super soldier" who catches 13 Germans with one hand, accidentally and coldly shooting several Germans in just seconds as a shooter and then following enemy lines to try to capture Kaiser himself! Indeed, this was a major departure for a small hiker, though it was, at the same time, very very amusing and humorous. The film is exceptionally well-paced, well done and I'm sure he did a lot to boost home support for our troops (too bad it was so meaningless and costly war).
