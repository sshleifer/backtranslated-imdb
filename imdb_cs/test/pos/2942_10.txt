I saw this movie with my friends and we all loved it! It's such a sweet and pleasing, real tear! I was still thinking about the days I saw the movie. It is such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families go through. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night. Everyone will really enjoy it with their friends, family, friend! : D It's a real story about a real family pulling a heart. Not to mention beautiful landscapes and fantastic acting. I see it, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!
