One of my favorite non-MGM musicals, it's classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty popping out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off her dance skills and introduces her musicals to his nervous and innovative choreography that would eventually change the way musicals are choreographed. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana, and Eva Arden injects this film with a lot of classes. The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era of big Broadway shows, films come out, Cover Girl was not adapted to the theater.
