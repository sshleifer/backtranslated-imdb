Seth McFarlane is a real genius. He created a show that is funny, culturally sharp and just downright cheerful. For those who think that her "offensive" social or cultural themes don't make meaningful comments, they just cause "insult", they can be alerted to this quote: (stem cell laboratory) How long have I been there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why don't we finance it?!? Why really. Thanks to the family, it's not just the funniest show on TV (with the exception of a lot of loved ones, much missed futurama), but also be very smart to boot.
