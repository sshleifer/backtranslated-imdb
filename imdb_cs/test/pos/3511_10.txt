I saw it for the first time in the afternoon in the 1980s on the T.V. I think I was like 9. (Today, a picture that has seen violent horror plunges on regular TV). Anyway, I saw it again a few years later and it's like I remembered, it's a really good, frightening flick. I think the reason why it might be unnoticed is that it wasn't followed by a **** load continuation, ie Friday the 13th. Although it is a killer in the whipping woods on Friday, it has more to do with the original Texas Chainsaw massacre. This is because the film sets a certain atmosphere and a sense of fear, even in broad daylight. And murderers feel more at risk than on Friday. There's also a lot of tension. I recommend seeing it now when it's released on DVD at the end of July.
