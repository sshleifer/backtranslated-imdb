I first saw it as a child (LITTLE RASCALS first went on television the year I was born) and bought it quite recently on DVD. Meanwhile, I watched it on the occasions in which he was, and he noticed that 1) the cake fight itself and 2) some of these racist parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, for example voodoo. I think Roach and McGowan would be beaten to death if they tried to do it now. Note how the cake meets in HOLFWITS 'HOLFWITS' The Three Stooges' HALFWITS and THIS WORLD PIE AND PIE this ... and this movie came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's BATTLE OF CENTURY for these films ... remember that at that time, everyone was stolen from the best! One more note: Laurel & Hardy enthusiasts that the lady to sell the oven was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared on TBOTC - the 'drum' that got into her car and got it on rear end. She always misses me why they never counted her?
