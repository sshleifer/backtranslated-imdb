When I first heard about "Greek," I thought I'd watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of the ABC Family is such a bad-are-almost-good show. But tuning with a college friend both of us both looking forward to a pilot episode much more than we expected. As a member of Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes that are brought up here are those that come almost every time someone talks about associations and brotherhoods on campus. And they are also very fun to play on their own, let alone watch on the TV screen. The opening scene emerged only into a slightly dramatic version of the preparation for a real formal rush in some guilds and continued from there. This is not a show for too sensitive Greeks. If you manage to go on jokes about things that aren't so big about Greek life, then you'll spend the first episode and probably many more, screaming and screaming. But everyone else should have as much fun watching it. It's nothing new, but it's nothing about college.
