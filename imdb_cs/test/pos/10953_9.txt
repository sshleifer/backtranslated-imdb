slow motion but smart. walks past you like you live. Filled with the idea of ​​provoking the Art Race Ideas and being cool. One thing hit me hard was the idea of ​​rock n 'roll lifestyle. all the performances were improvised, I will say it again ALL PERFORMANCE ARE IMPROVED sounds like a trick, but it's not that these characters are real and just like some of the ones you'd meet. this is also an amazing thing when you think about how strong the character is in this movie. right from the start in the titles, he immediately starts Ben as outcast as he moves in the crowd <br /> <br /> Good to break up like this if your jazz / rocker cool guy likes you If your clever and understand the big cinema out of total crap you will love it and if your both then it could be you fav <br /> <br /> but if your none of them then you are likely to think its boring and say they don't follow " one line "and write a crap review like Ben_Cheshire
