This is, in short, a television comedy series with the best casts ever, and most sympathetic as well. Each one is the first one? The actor's manual comtor.I know only one TV series which was better (ie, "Moonlighting") that one had Willis as lead? but it has Willis only, while Queen Queen has pocket actors who are as gentle as one can enjoy - Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine, and even everyone else of them - spontaneously and continuously and I enjoyed it. Words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously spared the current TV stupidity and garbage. It is politically incorrect and does not question minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> The comic is very tasty and spicy. <br /> <br /> I've read, mostly consistently, several IMDb writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows? yet, although these writers are several, I have met, at none of them, the slightest mention of my favorite TV shows (- but it's true that critics one likes, are not those with whom they find themselves in full approval? but those who at least offer a common ground for disagreement), which are mainly WILD WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, TWILIGHT ZONE 1980s, Bradbury TV show and SANDOKAN. Most of them I saw when I was 13? 14 years; I wrote and honestly wrote a few of them.
