In this film, "Sexual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine has no luck in love. One day, when she stands up, she goes with her boyfriend to a viral reality conference where she is introduced to a machine that can change your look, days, and what you like in virtual reality. He decides to try it, but begins to make his friend, his senate. Then suddenly an explosion occurs in the gas pipe and its creature comes to life. I won't say anything more, you'll have to watch a movie that's pretty fun to watch.
