I have heard a lot about "an English patient" and finally decided to get a CD and find out what the ballyhoo was all about. What I found was a film pleasure and should be repeated "should" be always watched with an open mind. If you're a religious, moral fanatic, I'm afraid it's not a movie for you, because you can't see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you continue to pursue the moral dilemmas that make this movie. As I remembered before watching this movie, I read the review on this site and I was deeply disgusted by the look of the man I quoted that "the protagonists have earned what they have received". As for morality, I agree with him, but that is not the way to comment on the film of this magnificence. I have to admit that I rarely saw this precious film. I can still hear the background sound in my subconscious. First and foremost, it is a love story and yes, it's an extramarital affair (moralists are careful), but we can't focus on it. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It's a mixture of flashbacks and the present. His screenplay takes place in World War II and tells us the story of the survival of the plane crash (Earl Almazhy played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes), who is cared for by an army sister (Julie Binoche) in a war-torn Italy just before the war began. (defeat axial forces). The scarred scarred patient kept a very painful memory of the annoying affair he had with the English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in pre-war African countries. The past and the present are so tightly drawn into the story you've been transporting in the story, and you get the feeling that you are a first-hand viewer. The locations in the desert and in Italy are beautiful, as are the figures. I am a romantic and I am not ashamed to say that I had tears after it was over. Watch it with someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same shot of the desert, where sand dunes rotate and curl like a woman's body, and it was breathtaking. The feeling of loss and grief was so greatly conveyed to the actor that I wonder why God! Why do we have wars that destroy beauty and the most forgivable of all, the destruction of innocence. Anyway, she deservedly won a lot of Oscars and I'm going to hunt other works by Anthony Minghelly. Lawrence of Arabia, which was also founded in the desert.
