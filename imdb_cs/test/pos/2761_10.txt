Graphics is not by far the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to the subway. He deserves a strong love. It's a crazy game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters ... it's just a massive game. Lose your money for this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted correctly. And even though graphics suck, it's not a good game. The graphics were good at the time. Today, the graphics are crap. WHO CARES? As they say in Canada, it's a fun game, yes. (You get to Canada in THPS3) Well, I don't know if they say it, but they could. who knows. Canadian people do it. Wait a minute, starting with the theme. This game rocks. Buy, play, enjoy, love. It's PURE BRILLIANCE.
