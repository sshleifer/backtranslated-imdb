Touching the Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds out she is taken and is determined to find her birth mother. The main success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that represents the hero. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in the war-torn Sri Lanka, feels like a completely different and unsatisfactory film. It's big for blasts and special effects, with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels avoiding grenades, running from fireballs, and being stuck with stunt wires. Everything a movie can offer is a cheap fake phrase like: "Sometimes peace must come" and "maybe the kids will find a way." The final sequence, where the daughter and mother unite, is good, but so much with the music and the well-timed downpour that is as cheated. I know, I know, it's all in Bollywood style. But it is a story where great moments simply lighten a simple, powerful central story. Certainly Bollywood could occasionally use a little restraint.
