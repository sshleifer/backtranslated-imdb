It was one of the movies I always came across (either on TV or cheap DVD), but it never hit me to do it the way I thought I didn't. It was one night and I thought, wasn't it? why not. Good decision, too, because I would have been digging for getting so long. For me, it left me with an impression, because it is there with the best features of Burt Reynold ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') and streams back to those bold, stubborn urban thrillers of the 1970s and 1980s, which have not been afraid to be ominously obscure and go out of their way to set characters, wrap it up realistically by brutal force and effectively incorporate local locations (Atlanta's case here) to fold with grounded photograph. In some shades, it reminded me of Dirty Harry, but it's free. However, it is a juicyly improved blues score with its creaking kicks, funky shifts and fanned sounds, I thought Lalo Schifrin was the pulsating score he organized for 'Dirty Harry'. The music soundtrack on the other side is hit or miss. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was an atlantic narcotic before he slipped into the bust when he saw he was dependent on work. Along with his new team, he encounters a prostitution ring that takes their interest because of the fact that he is owned by one hard way and condemned the perpetrator of the crime. What they dig up includes a prominent governmental personality and a call-girl who can give them some important names, but they have to get to her before she becomes a target. Burt Reynold's acts, but also manages incredibly solid and muscular fashion that would fit his laconically harsh performance and thematically hard script by Gerald Di Peg (which was adapted from William Diehl's novel). Well, he shows some heart / bright thoughts between that armor inside the scenes involving the glamorous capable British actress Rachel Ward, being it ranging scenes when he watches her from another building (and slowly become infatuated by her) to when when but these last half-way interactions slow the momentum, but give it noir like strokes. The performances are quite in place with Reynold's formulation of a great relationship with exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The fearsome and funny dialogues between these guys were an explosion. As far as corrupt villains are concerned, Vittorio Gassman builds an impressive strength and power, but it's Henry Silva (born for these roles), a carelessly cunning and unstoppable turn doing the show. Where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place. Plus his adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climax with Sharky and his team is brilliantly done. Exciting action passages can be quick and dry, but they remain lethal violent, such as the extremely sharp teeth of the interrogation sequence. Some handy, old fashion film techniques add to the tension. Interesting material keeps him a bit tactical that the character is derived, but when we think his smooth voyage offers a dull surprise or two along with some intense confrontations.
