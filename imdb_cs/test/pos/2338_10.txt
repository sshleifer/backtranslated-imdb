I just watched the DVD of this award-winning film. One Life Stand is a sharp drama that, thanks to its pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, portrays a very convincing and honest picture. It is a story about a life dilemma about power, sex and control, which is highlighted by several sad lonely lives. Mother (Maureen Carr performed very well) is on herself. The father only appears on the side lines and yet is a strong and pivotal part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. Writing was excellent and I liked the sensual detailed images of details such as nails, red lips, candle, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was used was very intimate. It's a horrible story, with sexual tones, while Glasgow drizzle on the dark streets contributes to the despair of sad characters. There are some very unforgettable shots delivered simply on foot, or the shoulder fell - like Trise is leaving under the bridge. And a stunned and wounded look on Trise's face in a call center who hopes to help people with tarot cards when listening to the caller about their own abuse. At the beginning we see John Paul, wide and innocent, with photos as he wants to try out modeling. Trise, his mother, is deceived and makes a bad decision for him by pushing him while trying to keep him. John Paul's modeling turns into escort work and Trise's boss offers her money and eventually goes on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. One of the great scenes is when they have a pretty normal meal and are starting to open a little when the father appears with his dark presence and cloud. But this and other things offer moments of hope. I felt that at that time the pace of the movie was too intense, but that was a little detail in another wise, challenging and unforgettable movie. bit differently. It stands in opposition to most American films that are either total fantasies or a real 'world' as seen on the spots. This film captures life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. This is not a "light entertainment" but a provocative and realistic drama. One Life is a Really Fun and Honest Movie.
