Frank Sinatra played in this strange little shortcut from RKO, which is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time that the war was over and it is a nice plea for religious tolerance. The film begins with Sinatra on stage on stage. After leaving the stage, he went out into the alley and found a group of children choosing another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at (or helping them) boys, Sinatra brings a nice civic lesson on religious tolerance and compares prejudice with fascism. Children seem to be given a lesson, but then, from blue, Sinatra starts singing a song that, frankly, will get the kids. He had a beautiful voice, but unfortunately I think that was reflected in the excellent news he gave the children about tolerance. It's a case of good news with too much singing - even though the singing of a guy is Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting curiosity - a nice historical piece that is often overlooked ... and it is quite touching, even if it looks a bit schmaltzy.
