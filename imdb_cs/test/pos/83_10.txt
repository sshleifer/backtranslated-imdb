Channel switches one night I just caught the beginning of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of the adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us to childhood and reveals a very disturbing reality from Adam. I'm not going to tell you more, but it's a very deep film and will surely interest you. That was, in my opinion, one of Jimmy Smits' best roles.
