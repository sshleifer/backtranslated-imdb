In my review, I just turned to a young actress as Catherine when she was supposed to be Veronika. I was so involved with the character and action I thought I wasn't interested in. By the way, she and the movie are brilliant. As I said, cinematography and the director's use of editing are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman, Tiso. Production design is top-notch. The location of actors in the foreground, middle ground and background within a given mission en scene is worthy of study. Stunning, unforgettable camera movement and the end that has an emotional blow that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow. Thanks again, John Hart
