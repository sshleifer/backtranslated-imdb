I thought I might be disappointed again after so many years. On the contrary, now I was more impressed than in my calm youth with honesty and brave humor. In 1969, the transition between African-American groups from the predominant policy of conciliation and integration to confrontation and self-determination was still entirely new and more than controversial. It took courage and kindness to portray both the founding and the antisevolution as cartoons that are often approaching in real life. Particular mention should be made of the performance of Arnold Johnson: he has successfully avoided his character disappearing in sociopathy or buffoonery. I'd rather watch it than "To Sir With Love" every old day!
