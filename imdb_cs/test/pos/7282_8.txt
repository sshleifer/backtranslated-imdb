I was pleasantly surprised when I found a very nice movie that kept me in full attention. I am a horror fan and I see almost everything in this genre, but Dead Line scared me. The speed is very cleverly set and Andr√©s Bagg is a good performance as a desperate man. What is the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you end this? Martin Sanders asks him when he sees the homeless talking to him alone, alone in the street. At the end of the film, the character of Aaron Mandel asks the same question when he sees another homeless person doing the same thing; despite not knowing that this homeless person is Martin Sanders, he answers the question of the beginning of the film. Broken glasses in two are a clear symbol of bursting and splitting ... personality. The end is jaw dropping and you just know that the sequel will have to be done.
