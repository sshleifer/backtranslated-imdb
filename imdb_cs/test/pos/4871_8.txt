I think I'm some Road Runner fan. I don't care how predictable it is. "Beep, Beep" is predictable most of the time, though it is very brilliant. Of course, the Road Runner is being chased by Coyote, and of course Coyote will not catch the Road Runner with every new attempt. The plans Coyote is coming with are very funny. You can see exactly where they go wrong and you won't be disappointed. Well, once you're a little disappointed about what you think will happen, but it doesn't mean, but the joke is even more fun. Predictable gags work and animation is sometimes great and pretty.
