I honestly do not know what words the IMDB will allow me to use in this review, so I have a hard time describing these short times. Let's say there is a good amount of homosexual sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial ... members. And every minute I loved it. Not that it was a mundane humor. It's not so. Mostly they break away from the gags, except for one sketch called "Pizza", in which they use it very well. "They" are a 3 / 11th short-live sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State, namely David Wain, Michael Showalter, and Michael Ian Black. Trio go on adventures, usually play alone and meet strange and unusual people, people who are often actually more normal than them. The support cast is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell perform in different sketches. They are also connected by other State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Dove. Music selections are also very well located. I enjoyed these sketches again and again, but they are not for everyone, because most of the time they are quite vulgar. If you like smart humor, which is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste, then I highly recommend it. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (directing and writing Wain and Showalter) or State, then you should really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I think it can currently be ordered only online. Check out their website and stream a few sketches to get an idea if you really want it first, and then find out how to buy a DVD.
