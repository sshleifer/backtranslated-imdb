I expected FAME to be an uplifting film, but it ended up the opposite. The whole story, which follows the lives of several determined students attending art school, has a strong potential. However, FAME builds his characters beautifully and then leaves so many questions when he quits. I was very surprised when the promotional scene appeared - we thought the DVD skipped or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts of some kind, and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! You may think there are too many characters, but it's probably too many scenes. His apparent film has been shortened and abbreviated because it sometimes lacks a transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with her character's ambition and her heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, a stereotypical poor man who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't particularly like the character of Coco from Irene Cara, but it's not Cara because her script is weak and her character isn't exhausted. Her voice is beautiful and she hears her songs guarantee the whole movie. In short, the film could benefit from many improvements, but quality actors and great music will gain their place in film history.
