And I. Peter Falk has created a role to live on TV forever! And for that I am grateful. But this is not one of his best hours. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he deals with crime, and yet there are bad people who go on and think they're smarter than him. What all fans know is that Columbo needs a good opponent. Without a big enemy, how can a hero be in a wrinkled coat? Still, it's better than NO Columbo, and I'll wait and watch the next one.
