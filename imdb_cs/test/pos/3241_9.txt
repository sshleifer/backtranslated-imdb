Although it breaks away from the book a little, you can't help with atmospheric music and settings. Bath scenes are exactly what they should be. Although you have watched it as many times as I have noticed that the people in the background are the same in every scene, but aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but the men and women really bathed together like that? You have seen all the men who were sitting around the outdoor fun with women. It also seemed strange that everyone had their hats, but maybe it was the style at the time. The social scenes were very nice, the dance and clothes looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first dance scene. Northanger Abbey looked impressive, but I liked it better. Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs. Allen I feel. He was in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either. General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives some good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not perform well as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression that he is a greedy and lecherous man, perhaps not a character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it. , but when new scenes and characters are added, they usually bother me. Mar≈°ionka! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story or her brush page. <br /> <br /> Part of the script is special. When Catherine asked Elinor Tilney for her mother's death, she asked, "I assume you saw the body? How did it seem?" What is a stupid thing? Elinor's calm reaction is also stupid. Anyway, please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
