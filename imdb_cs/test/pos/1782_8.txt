This is the episode most likely to be related to his affiliate law, "Thou Shalt Not Kill", in that it still raises the controversial question, "Why are we killing people who kill people to show that killing is bad?" This question is presented in two parts of the episode: before killing, where the film shows a dichotomy between an idealistic ascending lawyer and a street criminal who is captured in his travels so that his life is just an idea of ​​what to do, followed by a post-judicial period process and before execution, when both are forced to suffer for death, they feel responsible and so participate in them. One of the biggest things these episodes of work are in both big and small travels the story is fully developed, so we understand how the motivation and history of characters we are able to spend a little less than an hour with. For all his criminal intentions And the mockery is still very sympathetic to the killer, turning the most important part of his actions around the history of accidental death. His way of killing is more of a desire to control death than any desire to truly destroy. Similarly, the idealistic naivety of a lawyer shows that one does not want to let death happen in a world where it cannot be controlled. Their meeting is really important; both must give up without promoting it. As a party, it is interesting to see how much this episode affects the viewing of Rouge, Kieslowski's later completion of the Trois Colors trilogy. One of Kieslowski's greatest influences seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and since the Ten Commandments is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, it seems to be the most self-confident. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
