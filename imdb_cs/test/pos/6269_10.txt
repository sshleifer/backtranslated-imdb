Blademaster is definitely an unforgettable record in the category of Swords and Sorcery. I found Blademaster along with Quest for the Mighty Sword in a mental retardation store with people with intellectual disabilities. Credible sets and costumes, a good sword fight and a beautiful female warrior, Mila, make it a nice watch. But a few problems were a lot of detail on the land that didn't fit like the cave men. I didn't understand their purpose. Also, this movie could really benefit from some other monsters. The snake was fine, but I think he borrows a little from Conan. However, any primitive type of movie where someone closes with a hanglider is fine (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is fine! Oh, and someone else reminded Gallager of the villain or was it just me? I give blademaster 7/10
