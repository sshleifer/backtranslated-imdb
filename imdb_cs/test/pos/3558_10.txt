Based, to some extent, on the authors, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, their own experience as Butlins Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK during the same time schedule, followed by "Hi-De-Hi!" Located in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hou-de-Hi" presents the "slapstick, postcard of humor" of post-war Britain. British coast owned by mega-rich but never seen (on screen) by Joe Maplin. Although the actual show began in 1980 with a pilot episode and ran until 1988, when the BBC considered it too tame for its top comedy department, seasons 1-5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6-9 Illuminated 1960 - The time when the old style of a British holiday camp began to decline, during the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (played famously late, Big Simon Cadell) was a camp entertainment manager, well-intentioned, yet slightly pensive ex-university professor Breaking from his higher class background and embarking on a "real" world to the head of his entertainment team, who were in stark contrast. to his own celebrity N 6 onwards, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the show at the height of his popularity), a former war hero of the RAF, which, in many ways, was similar to Cadell's character in the background, but more \ t "Hi-De-Hi" stars over the nine years were Ted Bovis (played by Paul Shane), a stereotyped working class, but drinking, bawdy comic - someone who could never resist the opportunity for campers to stand; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc who is currently experiencing a comeback career with appearances in the hit BBC Comedy, "Little Britain"), boss of Yellowcoat (What Entertainment Staff Was Called Due to Their Bright Yellow Jackets) and Sports Organizer - But More Importantly \ t a person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), slightly dopey, but nice little hut with a burning ambition to become Yellowcoat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé, who learns more about "show business" than hoped. As usual with Croft & Perry production, the assembled character cast was a lot of bugs that the actors played great. Mr. Partridge (played by late Leslie Dwyer, who was in the 1970s when he left the show), a children's entertainer who hated children; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former champion with a dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland and Barry Howard), former snobbers of former social dances who were at the twilight of their career; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main girls of Yellowcoats who have always been looking for entertainment Joe Maplin will never allow in one of his camps. "Hi-De-Hi" typified the grotesque era of the late 50s with its strangeness and to some extent vulgar humor of "tongue-in-cheek" (jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about "women with big knockers "were in the order of the day. But despite being "Carry On", she was always so innocent and in the 1980s she became something recommended for the family. Of course, the critics of the show noted that the show was overtaken by being welcomed by a good few years, but I do not agree. While early years focused mainly on foolishness and humor slapstick, the second series "Hi-De-Hi" saw more thoughts embedded in the script and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon & Gladys Pugh) managed to grow with a more sensitive story line. This means that there were several criticisms at the show. Clive Dempster was no Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the former was not entirely on the chemistry screen with Gladys, as Jeffrey did (I personally think it would be more believable if Gladys married Jeff); the five seasons devoted to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new characters were not properly explained, especially with the Yellowcoats who came and went with Gladys Pugh, who was invented in the pilot episode with great regularity and character) that he is a freely loving man-eater who has been suddenly transformed into a naïve virgin! so that the rest of the year reaches out in five other series, there was something incredible, but the show should not have been carefully watched and the comedy more than its deficiencies. All in all, "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies since the BBC's golden age, and even if it never managed to rival such British comedy bases as "the only fools and horses", " summer wine ", Hi Hi Hi" will bes She remembered the comedy that If you have not tried it yet, please do so.
