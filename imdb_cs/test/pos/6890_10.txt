All I can say is that I miss this show !! My wife & I got married when this show started! Why did CBS take it out of the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family. It made me laugh! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it out of the air, my wife and I thought CBS made a big mistake. You know what would be so great? Have a reunion show! That would be so cool !!!! Does anyone know if he's still on DVD? In the last season of the promised country, did CBS show up last season? I think CBS took him out of the air in the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget it. The launch of this theme song was fantastic !!! This show comes only once in a lifetime! May we never forget Promised Land !!
