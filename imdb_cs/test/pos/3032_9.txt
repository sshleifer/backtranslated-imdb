Forget the story of this movie. Forget it is beautifully done by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget it is one of the few films starring Jennifer Lopez to star in. Although the story was impossible to believe and most of the dialogue seems to be fanciful, one and the only important thing to remember when you are thinking of watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing images that have ever been filmed on film. It's like Salvador Dali has decided to do a criminal drama. He must see anyone who has a serious interest in cinematography and the use of a film cell as a canvas to display true works of art. I'd have to give this movie 9/10 for its amazing visual display.
