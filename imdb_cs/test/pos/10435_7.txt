I see there are great reviews of this movie already, I have a few points to comment on, the reasons why I thought there was something special about this movie ... <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the movie is realistic. It may not look realistic for an adult who has forgotten what it was like a teenager but it is really a kind of superdrama that goes among teens all the time. Secondly, the good man, the one who treats women with respect, doesn't get the girls. so it is, the same in real life! it is too nice for its own good. people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some confidence. This means that this role has already taken the trust of the actor, not just the character. Overall, I thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides among the mad, partyin teenage comedies on the shelf. Don't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
