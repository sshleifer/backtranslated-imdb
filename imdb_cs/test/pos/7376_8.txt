Originally I sent the user's first comment on this movie and claimed it was stupid and it didn't make sense. DIDNT MAKE SENSE. Campfire stories is thoroughly enjoying the movie (now that im about 2 years older and watched last night). The actors were famous, but not famous. The act itself was more than acceptable, it was rather good. I'm going to rate the movie on the movie segment. 1) Black and White Scene (AKA- "The Hook") useless, it looked good, but it didn't hold much grip at all, the only disappointment, I don't think it was even included as a segment. It's a scared meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The RV Story (Honeymoon Honeymoon Stuck) Maybe the funniest of all stories, the acting performance was in this case also good when typical caravan sex scenes fell apart. Yet it was intruiging, you think "WHo was knocking on the door". He had tension, not too gory. Licked this one <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet Chat Tale (Little Girl Meets Psycho) This was a clever addition, gore left at minimal, frights left at I though boring at times, the last few minutes were the most fun, dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch.Real creepy, and could happen to anyone, so watch who you're talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 4) Ghost Tale (Man kisses ghost) ?? It wasn't the best, it wasn't too atmospheric for a ghost fairy tale. This one was strange, the aspects were pretty good, they played music and shouted, but everything was too real to be horrible, though it was good, it was a quiet bloody and could be better with this idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) End (4 Lost Teenagers) These are 2 attractive gals and guys tell stories through-out the movie. The best thing about the movie is the definitantley end, it's a big impression the end was totally un-expected.Watch it, it was so well done, realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) > <br /> 6) FILM OVERALL The campfire said it was more than I took it, actually I like it so much now that I bought it on video, caused its really funny horror movie forgot the trash you see in these days like many, im disappointed that it really didn't go anywhere, it was right on the video, to me it was better than all the hype "ho" rror "you see these days. overall for campfire stories <br /> <br /> - ---------------------------- (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
