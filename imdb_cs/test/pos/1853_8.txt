When I saw the trailer for this movie, I said loudly to anyone especially, "This film is about to bomb". I also said about MATRIX and see what happened there. Now I'm not a box office guru, but I usually have a pretty good gut about what's going to be good and what it really sucks. In this case, I was blinded by my total and utter apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me give it to you differently: I don't like his man (from what I read about him in interviews, he is incredibly pre-madonna and he is full of himself considering everything he did is X) -Files) or as an actor. PLAYING GOD was a really bad movie, but he thought he deserved big money on a big screen for some reason. But I am glad to say that even though these things may be true about man, Return to Me is wonderful and has a heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt directed a beautiful story and told him with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, and although it may seem a bit sad and maudlin in his premise, give him a chance and you will be addicted. It has to be said (and it bothers me) that the reason this movie works so well is thanks to the story and the cast. Duchovney and the driver are so amazing and believable that I sincerely wanted to cry with them. There is one particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he drops down on the floor of his house. As he always does, a family dog ​​looks at the door to wait for his wife to walk. Roba (Duchovney) tells him with his shirt collar still blood splattered that he will never return home. . Then he calls him a dog and seems to share a scream. The dog launches a small scream and then Rob cries. And that's one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in any character in every movie. You can feel his pain, and at that moment I forgot that I was watching an actor I don't like generally, and I felt I was looking at someone I knew when I lost his beloved. That's a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> Another strong point of the film is the supporting casting. Bonnie Hunt linked an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters who share a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. This is a delicious name in itself. And they're heading for the diametric range of clashing cultures is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece (I think it is). And that's the character Minnie Driver plays. This scenario is mature for comedy, and Hunt's nothing missing. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also shared some funny moments when middle-aged and Belushi get the highest points when they accept humility gracefully. and showing off his big stomach for laughter. With his family consists of three or four children, there is very little time for him and his wife to have quality time. And again, Hunt handles it with perfect elegance. It's a wonderful story about finding true love, knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful romance, and although I don't have much admiration for David Duchovney, I have to admit he was perfect in this role and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing his character. He was sensitive and believable, and the film was good for him, not just because of him, but he definitely added to the taste. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy for good romance and want a good cry, then it's a movie for you. 8.5 out of 10 I'll see anything Bonnie Hunt is sitting with on the director's chair.
