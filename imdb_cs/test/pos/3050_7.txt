An evil country baron holds water to a group of ranchers to try to take their property to pennies on the dollar. Later, Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne) comes to save the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter by going secretly as the latest criminal thief. The first of sixteen Wayne films for Lone Star / Monogram Paintings, it tries to cast him as a singing cowboy, with an apparently synchronized voice. The title card prominent features its character as "Singin 'Sandy" leading one to believe that this was intended to be the first in the proposed series! Yes, that's ridiculous, but also a lot of fun to see Wayne sings songs and fires guns, especially when he does a little ditty before shooting it with Earl Dwire. Destiny Riders features a rare villain role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, who clowns around as many bad guys as he played heroic sidekick, ride along Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
