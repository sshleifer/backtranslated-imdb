What movie! He has an undeniably entertaining subject (if you aren't prude) and a mature, fun and comprehensive script by Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Hard Eight). PT Anderson will undoubtedly be for some time. The evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. Each character is expertly played and touching and fully shaped. Burt Reynolds as Jack Horner (director) to Julianne Moore (his movie star) and Mark Whalberg (as Dirk Diggler) are all wonderful. And the story? WOW! An honest look at business and failures and consequences and family. One of the best movies ever! I gave her >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> A +
