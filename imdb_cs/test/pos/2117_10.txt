My mom and I went to the premiere of Ft Worth to see George Strait, but in the end we got a chance to see the premiere of the film at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful movie that not only displays the beautiful landscape of Texas, but also a great story. It was well written, directed and produced, and my mom and I loved it from start to finish! I thank Jay for giving us the opportunity to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget. Just as if filming was not enough, we were also lucky to sit 4 rows in front of my favorite singer George Strait! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Keep up the great work and thank you again! Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Value, TX
