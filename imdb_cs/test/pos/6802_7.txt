This was one of the first color films I saw in the cinema when I was a kid. It's good to remember. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, played with little and great actor Mickey Rooney. The film's content is good for all ages, goodwill and behavior. The good ethics of Velveta's parents, especially her mother, must be taken into account. Our generations should be well educated and this film can help this purpose. Velvet loves horses and races them, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) brought her to an international race competition in England where young Velvet won but was disqualified for a woman.
