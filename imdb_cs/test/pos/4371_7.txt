George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw so many of his specialties and even had the opportunity to see him live. He had a certain cynicism that I always liked. His last 2 specialties (especially life worth losing and complaints and complaints) lack a certain spirit and content. George looked overweight, old and tired (not to mention the healing of rehabilitation). "I said it's not important!" Anyway. Life is worthy The loss was particularly tragic because it was overweight, dissatisfied, leaving rehabilitation (we go there again ...) and extremely rude. If there was a way to apologize to a comedian without chasing him out of the stage, George achieved it because life is worth losing. It is as if the New Millennium and Post 9/11 America trampled George's spirit. Bs was too big to handle him. Comeback is partially successful with the program It's Wrong for Ya! This special transmutation is complete. George is no longer trying to revive his days of fame. He fully accepts his age, is old and deals with the prospects of death. He received being a crunchy old SOB and is relishing it. This is better than his previous specials, but far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a bit tragic. His observations are no longer sharp, and Andy Rooney seems to be more than Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He no longer criticizes us, but he's a tall man who points out how it was and how modern life is different. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two specials, but George still doesn't have his old fame back (if at all). He was reduced from a critical social and political stabbing commentary to mostly personal peeves. When he goes politically, he still has something to say. It is heavily derived (especially if you have seen any of his previous work), but it still functions somehow, as opposed to his random screams that lack certain relevance outside the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes is the best this special offer offers. For the time being, I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Pesci, who George can re-create as a top septuagenarian. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to be more tedious for George and his "art" is now his life. It is a step in the right direction from its previous 2 specials, but it is far from its old self. Where does it come from? It may never come back, but it may further improve this metamorphosis. Heres hope for 7 other words you can't say on TV or at least a windmill that can handle it.
