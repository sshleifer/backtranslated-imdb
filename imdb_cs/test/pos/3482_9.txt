I usually do not comment on movies because I'm in a movie, but I have to say it's one of my favorite movies ever. Acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheery manifestations or exploitation of disabled people to try this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such a great actor, I couldn't watch him if I tried. I was also impressed by Steven Robertson. I can't believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual is excellent. This is a movie for anyone who sees how happy we are. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you'll enjoy this story. You owe it to you to check this movie.
