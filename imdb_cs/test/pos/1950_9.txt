Freely based on current events, "River's Edge" is a movie, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but nobody does anything for a long time. time. With the highest level of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper playing, we are able to forgive the average playing of everyone else in the movie. The film begins with a young boy Tim (Joshua John Miller) doll from the bridge (murder # 1). Tim then hears someone screaming as he looks up, sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the river bank with his girlfriend's naked naked body behind him (murder # 2). Samson finally shows his body to his friends. All this is not only terrifying because of the murder, but also because the victim of Jamie (Danyi Deats) was their friend. Despite all this, nobody goes to the police. Maybe you think it's unrealistic, but that happened in a real story. If you're familiar with the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you'll know that the same thing happened here. Despite all this, Layne (Crispin Glover) is trying to keep Samson safe, though no one (including Samson) seems to care not to hurt him. As time goes by, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), middle-aged, who sells drugs to local teenagers, also killed a woman earlier (murder # 3). From there things begin to close to Samson and his friends, and finally everything is revealed, but not as you would expect. In the film they learned of three murders, each with a different response and a different effect on the participants. When Tim leaves his younger sister from a doll, we never realized his motive. But we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps her put a cross in her backyard in memory of her doll. Jamie's murder scares everyone (except Samson, who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when Layne asks him why he did, Samson says, "She talked sh * t."), But they don't disturb or scream, run and go with their lives trying to forget what happened. He didn't kill his hate girlfriend in Feck's situation. We never know why he killed her, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry and that he loves her. From this we see different ways in which we can be hit by death. In the film, it is easy for us to identify with teenagers because they don't know what they feel or how they should feel the death of their friend. Likewise, we, the audience, don't know how to feel because we don't know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by death and realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not feel strongly about Jamie as individuals. There are several similarities between "River Edge" and "Twin Peaks". (1990-1991), especially in the overall sense of film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking about "River's Edge" when they made their series. After all, Tim Hunter went on to direct three episodes of "Twin Peaks". Crispin Glover's performance as a hyper, frantic Layne is an Oscar performance. Layne is always in a hurry and is always worried about keeping Samson in the hunt, an intense figure who seems to be speeding. If you've seen Crispin Glover in any movie, you know he can deliver a line like no one else. It's always a pleasure to see him play. Another great performance in "River Edge" is Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck, a closed drug dealer with one leg and an inflatable sex doll called Elly, reminded me of a more toned and humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's film, "Blue Velvet" (1986). River's Edge is a great movie and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when we really need to perform and act against the evils of the world.
