If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wished it was an action in terms of what was popular at the time. I think blaxploitation flick in Louisville, Kentucky .. who would this thunk it?!?! I can imagine that the enthusiasm he had to have got Pam Grier, a pretty hot item to see in his picture. If you are familiar with the genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby doesn't necessarily get too far from the formula. Despite the change of place, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed Shark who muscles in loan companies, using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures. Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville policeman in Chicago who returns home at the request of his father, Brick partner (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheb's father, despite Shark's bullying tactics (... his man in the city is a Pilot, a wannabe gangster who is equipped with stogs who aren't so frightening, rather buffoonic in nature, so slim they hire men out of town, to shoot Shayne Loan Building) will not give up its company, and it will eventually make it worthwhile when a brutal force warning leads to its killing. Sheba take revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is grass. <br /> <br /> If you see Griera with a magnum, just sell this movie. A novelty setting in Louisville is its part. You can even look at a speedboat chase, Grier in gangster shootings (.. not necessarily the most generous species that could be used to see blaxploitation during this period in Chicago or New York), a lot of blood pouring out of the body bullet torn fire and colorful characters (such as a shark in a pimp suit called Walker and Pilot, who is one of the least spooky gangsters you will likely encounter) who appear during the movie, mostly with the misfortune of coming into contact with the very angry Sheba. The storyline itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth watching, and Girdler organizes a lot of action sequences to keep his target group entertained. A modest success for Girdler and one of his more advanced films.
