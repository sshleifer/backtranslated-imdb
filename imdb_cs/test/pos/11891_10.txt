I just finished the El Padrino screenings in Germany. Great movie. In the future we are looking forward to other films by Mr. Chapa. It was amazing to see such a well-formed film with such a tension and story that would remain an instant classic. The end with little ambiguity leaves the story open for continuation. In fact, the vision of a film with great quality outlines Chap's serious potential and his skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa impressed with many of his triumphant performances in "blood in blood," and has now demonstrated to all those who have seen his work his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control. Something that few filmmakers can afford.
