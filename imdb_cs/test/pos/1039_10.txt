... a true dream geek-girl: high-tech, high drama, smart guys, lighted sex and big blasts. (Very Large Explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the REAL Oppenheimer tapes sound strange: apparently he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's Triumph and Tragedy is one of the most surprising dramas in the 20th century, and this film stands as a model of what should be dock-drama: facts can speak for themselves, while fictitious parts are used to amplify and fill in the record to avoid attention on me. Interesting fact: some of the technical details used have only recently been declassified and are therefore of particular interest. You must see!
