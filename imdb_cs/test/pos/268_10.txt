I am surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. The film ... if I am aware of the series myself, had a huge following, pundits reviewers and real people alike, praising it for the person. Anyway, let me tell you that if you're like me, you're crazy about the rude police drama, you'll love "The Lost Child" Tennison, the heroine, in the "Prime Suspect" series, fights with the male police organization, the whole series, getting to her current, relatively strong position in the police hierarchy through hard work, stubbornness and sheer talent for police work. He is basically an ambitious career woman, but he has a romantic side and is definitely not a man. Unfortunately, her relationships are influenced by the bad hours her career requires and never married, so when she is pregnant from her last affair, she has to face the choice to become a mother and threaten her entire police work, let alone future progress, or an abortion she chooses. This abortion never emerges in the ensuing drama - it is very skilfully solved, in less than a few minutes screentime, by the miracle of the economy in scripting and editing - but it is always there as opposed to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another "Lost Child" - before it's too late. The story takes a lot of twists and turns before the end of the surprise, and one is fascinated, like, conspiracy, and characters (although I have found many villains a little exaggerated), the police, and especially Tennison, alone, aren't always competent, nor sympathetic, which numbers, given the unpleasant work he has to do, in the slender underworld that this series usually occupies. Mirren, herself, said she wouldn't do more movies in the series, but great because she was always in the role of Tennison, the series itself is like "actor proof" as well as my American addiction. The Law and Order of "Dick Wolf - Anyone Who Will Go There, Everyone Could Forever Go." How is my fervent hope.
