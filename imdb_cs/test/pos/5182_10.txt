I saw FAREWELL TO HARRY at the Plaza Theater while I was in New York. William Hall Jr. it is great. This is a movie for a classic movie visitor. The direction of Garrett Bennett reminds me of the work of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford. The film seems to go beyond the typical independent film. It has a soul and visual strength that is completely unique. I saw it with a small audience (400) who was captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and even though I was not out and crying (like a lady beside me) I must admit I had a little watering in my eyes ... <br />
