'Identity?? . . . . I am a part of my surroundings and I have separated from them and is able to distinguish these differences clearly, which allows us to have an identity and what is inside our identity is everything that has ever happened to us ”(Ntozake Shange qtd in“ Radiation in the Mirror ”) Pieces like Decalogue V have been intimidating with me, I felt that if I had accepted them, I would have compromised something, and what I had previously thought is not really worth it, I understand what naturalism is trying to say. a tangible catharsis and one that has existed after bits, and one who is still alive with what I have to reckon with. It still works in me. <br /> <br /> The film itself was not likable. There is certainly evil people in there, whether they should die is for another movie, what the Ten Commandments show is that there are good, beautiful people who kill other people when their society and primary urge rise. br /> <br /> 'Science' natural Ism is what helped me to appreciate the Ten Commandments. It's not worth writing space to go for it, why wouldn't I be left before that, but now I see it worth doing art like this "do" people, or maybe make people something they did. There is a method for Lazarus' compromise. . . light. Much of that sense makes sense only in hindsight. This should not be too strange when it comes to the idea: after all, how much respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. When I say that, I will be afraid, but naturalism seems to be much more productive and much less nihilistic when I have the power to say that "this bust, this process, this natural process, makes me behave system." <br /> <br /> I do not think that naturalism undermines the portrait of the human judgment day that tells us to give up our powder wigs and head for the forest. Instead, I think it is cataloging evidence and experiments that we can, of course, ignore. We can ignore this if we want to give more scientists more corpses. Certainly, despite their aesthetics, which was specifically designed without sympathy for the likely and catastrophic fate of their characters, their passionate feeling is readily inactive and snobbish in writing. I see a wonderful risk in the hope that viewers will understand what to do with what they see. As already mentioned, there is a danger in the hopeless vision of their destiny stone. There is a danger in hopeful contempt for Nature because it does not correspond to their world view. And I don't think "hopeful" may not be rich or happy. I haven't seen it, but American Beauty seems to prove a lack of circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics and gluttons, as well as beggars who wonder where their humanity is, who grieves because they cannot find anything separating them from their land. Countries can be powerfully and beautifully rendered, but they do not actually recognize landscapes. It changes, surely and dramatically, but only a great set of natural laws that no one really has. However, it cannot be changed.
