A gentle film that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes a change in our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions to the people we are not. This story is a love story where true emotions arise. For outstanding performances, I appreciated Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates. The movie is definitely worth seeing, a holiday roadtrip that turns into an emotional turn-and-round. I recommend seeing it.
