I have seen it several times and I have always stuck to it completely. It is very exciting and intense. Describe it sounds boring, but it's amazing. It's the kind of movie where you can't miss any thing, but if you soak it, it stays with you long after it's over. I'm thinking about it, I don't even know what Stone was trying to see. Just the story of Alan Green? I do not think so. It was a sight of ignorance, stupidity, self-destruction, and a guy who simply lost grip. Maybe he had more grip than listeners. I didn't like Barry, but for some reason I was still worried about him. I was confused why I couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie was over. I wish I could see Olive Stone this one in my mind.
