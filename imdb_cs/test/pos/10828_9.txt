"Bon Voyage" has a fast pace that reminds me in some ways of Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies - it's like you're on a fast train or roller coaster. Invoices like romance, mystery, thriller and farce; it is all and more, including sincere observations of the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. And it's also a juggling exhibition that includes 7 main characters. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for this period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well cast and gave great performances, but IMO's most amazing was Isabelle Adjani, who played the role of an opportunistic, middle-class French movie star; Not only did she convincingly play the role of a young actress who is perhaps half her age, but also her compelling playful play of her love tones so that the audience sees that only half is more serious and complex than a man who is just a golden excavator. Her character and energy drive the film from start to finish. It wasn't until I read Roger Ebert that I was 48 years old at the time of the movie. What beauty! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the ending - it's satisfying, but allows you to write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As he observed another user's commentary - he is not late; you must be away from the opening scene. Good advice. I gave her 9 out of 10.
