Set in the hometown of Bam Margera Westchester PA, 'Haggard' is a half-truth story about the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Valla. Dunn was fired by his girlfriend for 2 years, Glauren, who now saw a beer drinking, a long-haired metal head called "Hellboy," and that drives Dunn's lunatic jealousy. In a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is happening between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into her home and give evidence of the matter, with somewhat disastrous results for all involved! I found this movie very funny, maybe because I am a total of Jackass and CKY fan, and it has to be said that a lot of humor is likely to get lost on those who have no prior knowledge of Marger's crazy comedy movie. skaters, not least the look of skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk as a policeman. There are also portraits of Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis, and Bam's long-suffering parents, April and Phil. The DVD extra includes a music video from CKY (featuring Bam's brother Jess on drums), and Favorite Band Bam, HIM (Bam's character in the film takes his name from HIM frontman Ville Vallo) There's also a documentary and " too hot for jackass' skits. In summary, as I said before, this film will be especially interesting for skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I feel like Marger and what we have done a lot of effort with 'Haggard' and I for one, thoroughly you enjoyed it.
