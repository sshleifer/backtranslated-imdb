In most cases, my views do not concern the majority. I tend to lean towards the artsy, imaginative, and other. This film commemorated Frances Ford's "Black Stallion", where a fantasy situation is created to show off the beauty of a wonderful creature that is not readily available to display performance at its peak, except for these crowds of documentary films natural. Unlike these natural films, this offer uses the best film making techniques that industry offers, suitable for wonder, creating one of the most sensual super stars (cat) on the screen. This fantasy depicts a love affair that develops between a French soldier (also very kind), lost in the Egyptian desert, and a female leopard he encounters when he enchants himself over an abandoned Egyptian temple. I bought it all my heart. If you are at least a little open to imagination and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the cat, you should enjoy it. The only mistake in my book was the end. It was the perfect setting for the Romeo and Juliet finals - that would bring me to the top. <br /> <br />
