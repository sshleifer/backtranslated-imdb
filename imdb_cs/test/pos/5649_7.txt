I saw it in 1993 on a VHS tape, but I wasn't able to find it at any source. This is a very bleak and uncompromising view of the last days of the Japanese army in the Phillipines. Anyone interested in the Pacific War would see this film well and see under what conditions the other party is fighting. From what I can say, it is historically accurate and shows how easily people can go down to full barbarism. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the Phillipines until 1945, so there is no doubt many of the scary incidents listed here have happened. Maybe I couldn't identify myself with the characters of the movie, but I appreciate their humanity and their desire to survive. If I had to compile a list of the top ten war films, it would be a movie. See if you can get it.
