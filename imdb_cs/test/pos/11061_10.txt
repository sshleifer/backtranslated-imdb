For the first time I saw this movie when I was in elementary school, in the sixties. I was fascinated by the character of Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is best when it comes back to exact revenge on the father's wife and daughter (the mother was expelled in shame). During this time she meets the magnificent Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between them is great. The second half of the film takes place in Saratoga, NY (Saratoga of the title) and I never enjoyed it just like New Orleans, but it's still very good. I give this film ten - partly from nostalgia, but mainly because it's just a damn good movie and the characters except Bergman and Cooper are just as amazing (Flora Robson is approaching the theft of Bergman scenes). It has been shown on television periodically, but it is rarely shown if ever - it would be good for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles.
