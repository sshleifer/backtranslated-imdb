I'm sure I haven't seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but mostly they seem to be bloody vampires naked women who, if you like, are not bad things, but that's the main departure and could be almost Cronenberg minus bio-mechanical nightmares. Of course, with the exception of French with subtitles. The man on the road at night comes across a woman who is in her slippers and a bathrobe and raises her while another woman is still in the background, wearing nothing. It is obvious that there is something wrong with the woman, because she almost forgets things as quickly as they do. Yet it does not prevent a man from having sex with her as soon as he returns to Paris and his apartment. The man goes to work and some strangers appear in his place and take the woman to this "tower block", a huge apartment building called the Black Tower, where others of their kind (for whom there are no "no memory") appear to be the least their problems) are kept for some reason. The time and events of the march in the film, which mostly involve trying to find what's going on and getting out of the building for this woman, and she manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up first, come to her rescue. The revelation of what is happening takes place in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange but moving end. When Rollin avoided what seemed to be his "typical" form, he created his most interesting and busiest film in what I feel. I like this a lot, look at it. 8 out of 10.
