Not only is Nightbreed great, but it is also unique, even with other Barker films that never have originality. Amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea to the book. For a horror genre, it has quite a few fine symbols and links. Certainly a lot of fun to have, to think a little about whether it takes care of it. And don't forget, nice musical score. Well, special effects, as usual, accelerate faster than anything else, but that's probably the only downside. I saw it again after ten years and I still recommend it.
