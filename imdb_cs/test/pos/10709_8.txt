Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums in Rio, the favelas, specifically the strongest, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children in favelas in Rio have died in recent decades than they did in Israel / Palestine - a fact that is astonishing if it is true, showing how this social problem is recognized in the subconscious. the rest of the world. This is an important subject, especially for those who see the hope of local efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a live cultural program. This is a convincing document that is sometimes marked by a too similar version of a personality-based event and grainy digital video and film that can sometimes cause you to have your eyes examined. Drugs rule in favelas and artillery teen boys are major drug dealers as well as in some parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirell's film The City of God / Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of many Ravine favelas). But the early part of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys are celebrating violence and wanting to do drugs where money and action are. It's cool to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than revenue available by other means. Mochary first discovered AfroReggae and his leader Anderson Sá and José Junior during a visit to Rio and quickly convinced his friend and mentor Zimbalist to leave their job and come to help make a film with his own promise to finance it. He is eloquent and charisma, and a surprise intervention in his life makes him the center of the film and his main narrator, but as favelas himself the film abounds with other people. There is no doubt that she is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. Vigário Geral is in comparison with Bosnia: the shooting was very dangerous there. Friendship and protection of Anderson Sara and caution and diplomacy in shooting enabled filmmakers to access and shoot close-ups of their thematic areas, while (mostly close calls) to avoid serious confrontations with drug lords or drug dealers. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on the road home. The result was 10% of shots, including rare shots of violent incidents including police beating. It is hard for an outsider to track Rio police massacres. At the beginning of the 1990s, it was a story and inspired Sá, who ended her own early involvement in drug trafficking to guide her cultural movement. The cops are all over the drug store and if they don't like it, sick trained police paramilitary soldiers (often wearing black ski masks) come and shoot around to kill many innocent people. This is largely the picture we get in Meirelles' City of God, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other guys are coming, starting at Vigário Geral, but eventually spreading to many others favelas, which give drums lessons that attract dozens of young girls and boys. Their AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR) program, which was created in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young blacks in the Rio Ghetto. It leads them to leave smoking, alcohol, and drugs (that's the rule) to explode in rap, song, percussion, and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performance. Eventually, the best of the performers, led by Sá, will perform in front of the big local audience with local producers and their Banda AfroReggae has an international record deal. More centers and groups have been created or through GCAR over the years, in Vigário Geral and other favelas, they have tried to improve youth by providing training and staging of musical, capoeira, theater, hip hop and dance performances at GCAR centers. Performance art is not all but a focal point. GCAR is also a movement for wider social change. Raising public awareness through these performances also provides centers with information training (newspapers, radio, internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education to bridge the gap between rich and poor. , black and white, and offer workshops in audiovisual production, including documentary films. The program is currently active in four other favelas. There are many favela street and home life scenes in Favela Rising, and they look very much like the City of God images, with the important difference that focus and result are very, much more positive. Not that it was not a battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequality of the social system and the indifference of the population in Brazil are not directly addressed in any of them. But there is a scene where Sá talks to some young children in another favela, a cynical boy who is not thrilled with AfroReggae and is determined to work in a drug store when Sá behaves like a boy. She does not seem to convince any of them, even though they point out that traders do not do until the age of fifty. But we find that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also a description of the crazy accident that knocked off Sá, but with a positive result. It would be great if the pictures were sharper and clearer and if the story was a bit modified, but it is a lively, inspiring material and represents a committed, risky documentary and it is nice that Favela Rising was included in Seven Film Festivals and won a number of awards, including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at Tribeca Film Festival. He is currently exhibiting at the ICA in London. But it seems that a wide audience of art in the US is somewhat unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
