Right up, I love this movie. I love it all. It has a great soundtrack, it has a lot of recognizable faces and it's funny as hell. There are so many conspiracies in this movie and each one is funny in one way or another. Where Spicolli lit the screen two years back, Drake is almost as memorable. All he wants to do is have fun. She moves out of the house without her parent's consent, skips work whenever she likes it, is obsessed with sex, loves her drugs and booze and tries to be a good friend. It's his lacksidaisical attitude that makes him so happy to watch. And it comes with some great lines. And there are so many small insights you don't see, but they make you laugh at absolute speed when it hits you. One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's former girlfriend who is dating a different person today. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it on his shoulder. Then he says good night and the scene ends. It's the perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. She really lives at the party and has fun. When the conversation is over, his time is over and he does not care who is offending in the process. He has innocence about him. "It's occasional" is his favorite saying. Another such classic scene is Reggie, who gave Bill a donut. He tells him something that I and my friends will never forget, because we rewinded the movie ten times and watched the part over and over again and hurt the laughter. It must be seen to be appreciated. Wild life is throw back when teen comedies were funny, frightening, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world for 90 minutes. Wild life makes all these things perfect. If it's a movie you haven't seen, give it a chance. It's a classic. See also the soldier who has problems with Jim. Now it's a very familiar face and it's his first role on the big screen.
