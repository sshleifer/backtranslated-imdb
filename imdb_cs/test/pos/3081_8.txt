Robin Hood; Men in stockings are worth watching, I have watched it recently because I became a fan of Cary Elwes and that's one of his main roles. Some moments really broke me so hard! I didn't expect you to know, it was so funny, even the second time around you got out of the chair The cast is great, especially of Robin Locksley himself, Cary, but Blinkin and Sheriff and Little John big! Lol) and everyone else! There were of course moments, the film tried to make a comedy scene, but you necessarily laugh at it, but OK. This is the second time Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart, who incidentally appeared in the film together, both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching, pretty cheerful!
