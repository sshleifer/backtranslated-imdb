When I heard that the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] mini-series was based on the life of Changi [WWII POW] ... with a focus on "comedy elements", I was deeply skeptical and somewhat critical. My father served in World War II. Such was the barbarism of the Japanese, he was able to talk about the horrors in and around Labuan (where he was based), until quite recently. Together with my father, I have gained the wealth of knowledge of many great men (stronger in character and spirit than I will ever have) who have witnessed indescribable barbarism in the hands of the Empire of Japan and have never completely recovered. The name 'Changi' is destined to evoke terrible images for ages to come ... <br /> <br /> But while watching, I was very impressed by the cast, characters and complex conspirators of this wonderful series. I now consider "Changi" to be the peak of my week (keep in mind that I've only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the remaining episodes will follow the standards set by the first three). Black humor works unusually well (however, flatulence jokes are a bit exaggerated), and although most of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes quite close in passing undaunted spirit survivors who were able to later resume their lives in spite of inhibitory memories. The flashback format for this series will be difficult for some to watch, but I can't think of any better way to make adequate justice for men who have suffered a deep emotional scar on the internment ... when they remember painfully repressed experiences, sometimes years after horror. One of the darkest chapters of World War II, in the 20th century, and (as far as I say), in the history of mankind, is passed on to the new Thanks to this series, and I hope it will serve to overturn hostility borne by the war generation. Continuing 'Changi', I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to the tuned tunes 'on the way to Gundagai' anyway. Tune in...
