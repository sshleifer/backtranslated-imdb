This movie was all but boring. It deals with reality. For people who think this film was boring, open your eyes to real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse cannot be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical addiction adviser and I deal with these issues every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are affected by the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. It's all to prevent. This film should be shown at every high school in the world. If someone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy, send me an email at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thank you
