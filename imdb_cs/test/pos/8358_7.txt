Aslan Adam, or Lionman, as is commonly known among English-speaking viewers, begins with an epic battle when King Solomon and his army defeat a load of boys, although I'm not sure who they were and the film itself is not very useful. reality. After all these boys, Princess Mary, were killed by King Solomon, Bishop Osorio & Commander Antoine is forced to sign a treaty that allows King Solomon to rule everything in sight. Soon after Princess Maria seduces Solomon and they have sex, sometimes in the shortest wedding ceremony ever (only two sentences long) Antoine marries Princess Mary & plans to rebel against Solomon and get some slow revenge in the process. Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon, although his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, is escaping with her protector, Rosto, with Antoine's guards in pursuit, for the shortest time (less than 5 minutes or the time needed to run around the bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a young boy, which is hidden in some shrubs far from Antoin's guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to get a little fella, he finds out that the child has been accepted by the lion's pride as his own! A year later and evil Antoine now rules to heal his subjects without mercy, Princess Maria gave birth & he has a son, but Rostin is also still kicking around trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine, the task seems hopeless if they can get help from the legendary Lionman , which is more than an animal ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan & is one of the kinds of films I found, it is cheerfully bad, but extremely fun. The script is never taken seriously, it's a pretty funny movie occasionally, it moves along like a rocket & it's never boring or boring & some of the English dubbed dialogue is just hilarious in context with what's happening on the screen. None of this makes any sense, we get a boy raised by a Lion, an evil king, a betrayal, a secret of a dark family, birthmarks that form a lion, in a story element that was present before the child resurrected him. to fight scenes, to torture scenes where people who are bound to be twitching, ancient castle interiors that accidentally contain zipper wires and gymnastic rings have idiotic bad guys who seem to have extensive hair on their faces and a central figure that has a jawlike face jaws house-brick, can be stabbed twice, have hands covered with acid (this acid can eat it way through steel traps, but is stored in a ceramic teapot!) & fall over 20 feet on the concrete floor & still keep no serious injury! Aslan Adam is an amazingly entertaining movie, I don't think I saw any other movie like I could compare it if your search for something serious then forgets it, but if you like it - Good 'type of movies and you want to have fun, laugh and have fun then Aslan Adam should be at the very top of your list. A total of 100% gold for bad movie fans and those with a taste for different and bizarre. On the unsatisfactory side, Lionman gets only his steel claws 10 minutes before the end, which is a shame. Director Bayten definitely keeps things moving at a fast pace, even though it's far from well done, during the opening battle one moment the guys are fighting on the sand dunes of their next on a grassy hill with trees in the background! There is one point where Lionman uses a 'branch' to pole vault but it is apparently just a long trumpet with vines wrapped around it! Then there is a scene where the bloodthirsty pack of bloodhound is believed to chase Lionman, but the dogs are apparently different breeds, including the most damaging looking dogs at all! There are just as many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are just cheerful, stupid, bizarre, or all three I can keep forever. Just check when he finished when Lionman jumps and flies everywhere as if he could fly. There's a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, though not very actual graphic gore or violence, a few stabs and someone's hands cut off, it's like the graphics how it gets. Technically Aslan Adam's pretty rope, period costumes are bright and furry featuring purple, yellow, red and various other bright colors. Combat scenes are cheap, but at least filmmakers have tried to put as many actions as possible. The music seemed to be more suitable for classical ballet than for action film and is another bizarre aspect of Aslan Adam. Acting was bad, even dubbed, that you could say that acting was bad. Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish, there's plenty of stuff that you like, laugh and enjoy this movie that I just finished really like. Aslan Adam can by no means be considered a good movie in any sense, but it is one of the hellish fun movies. Maybe I'll have to watch this time sometime, just to prove myself that I didn't dream at all! The best Turkish action movie about a person you will ever see, a lion. Proven popular enough to spawn sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
