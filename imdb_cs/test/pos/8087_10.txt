I just saw this film at the Berlin Film Festival's Children's Program and killed me (and almost everyone else in the audience)! And don't think about it, this film belongs to all-250! Let me tell you that I am by no means affiliated with the creators of this film if that's what you think reading this. No, but this is actually IT! Not seeing the "kid-movie" label on it, "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is on almost every classic account (like "biblical")! The story relates to a 12-year-old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg) who is devastated to learn about her father's terminal illness. The US special operation would cost 1.5 million, and of course nobody could afford it. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would do - and break the bank! Does it sound ominous? Remember: This is not America and "Klatretösen" is by no means a blockbuster of Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour, which no one ever takes seriously anymore. Director Fabian Wullenweber has decided to make children a great action comedy and boys, succeeded! Let me put it this way: This film is collapsing like no children's movie and just a few more. And there is much more than "action". After about 20 minutes of exhibit (well done), which accelerates to a monster that: <br /> <br /> - effortlessly "embarrasses" the mission impossible (numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look really dear - take it, mummy!) <br /> <br /> - dwarfs almost every other movie, thrilling-wise (no simple-are-just-kids-antics here) <br /> <br /> - easily laces a dense story with enough laughter Carrey Looks at Career Alternatives <br /> <br /> - Nods at Damon Runyon and Karate Kid During Same Seconds <br /> <br /> - Comes with so much bad humor that the PC side hears how american rating commission wet pants from inside here troubling <br /> <br /> - can be really tender and sexy at the same time sexy (ohmygod, what do i say? they are kids! they are kids! - don't mind watching the last scene!) < br /> <br /> - stars of Stafan Pagels Anderson, who has been a "Mirakel" favorite game since last years All Children <br /> <br /> What is Ride!
