It was easy to condemn this film as an exaggeration at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "lefties", but the Three Mle Island accident provided a shocking context for this fictional drama. This film works on many levels, with shots of public service and television news. 1979 was the zenith's infamous "Happy Talk" television news format (see also "Ron Burgundy") and it's on display here in all its glory. Sonorous anchor grimly reads the story of "head-to-collision" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story about the vet who makes the house (or is it an "aquarium?"). The show's producer and station manager argue about the content - or about his lack - of behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. PR flack (James Hampton) shows the Fund and Douglas the necessary scale model of a hydroelectric power plant built by Westinghouse. Later, when Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (a nice-playing Lemmon's friend / colleague, caught between duties and loyalty) struggle with a sudden crisis at the plant's control center, they obviously operate boiling water (built by GE). A small point, but curious, considering how much detail screenwriters are right. Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. The real accident in the TMI proves the basic premise of the film. The working title of the movie was originally "Power," and you'll see why. As nuclear power prepares to return to the comeback these days $ 3, "Chinese Syndrome" is as important today as more than 25 years ago.
