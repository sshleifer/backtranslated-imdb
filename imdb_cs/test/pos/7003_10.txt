As a zombie fan, I really like these types of land where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent link to the Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang must run as fast as possible from the darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is the bad guy, but he's also a hero trying to save the slow people. The Muslim imam, Imam, relies on the sun's position for prayers five times a day, but is stuck in a country where darkness rules. Overall, I recommend this movie to all science fiction fans. You won't be disappointed.
