Murder by numbers is a pretty good movie. Though the plot plunges along the snail's pace, which connects with Sandra Bullock's character with her partner and film, which returns to the previous traumatic situation she was in, she will be able to engage in the film. <br /> <br /> I said I think it does a good job of setting up that scary kind of "who did it" type atmosphere. It keeps you guessing which one of the boys is really worth the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and the other guy (lol) are doing a good job of selling the tyrant versus dork. He's not sure if Gosling is playing a bad ass, but he did a pretty good job for a guy who would later play in the movie like The Notebook. But as soon as the film moves, I really found myself in the story as I asked, "Oh my God, what would I do if I were in this situation?" As I said, a good CSI movie, maybe not an addict EXTREME drama, but good all around the movie. 8 outta 10
