(Even spoilers were possible, but nothing critical was given out.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low budget movie and was disabled by the on-screen power level. All the actors themselves, especially John Daniels, must see another of their films. Not only can the film boast great performances, it can handle style sequences like the baron throwing someone out of the window and seeing glass shards falling into the pool that explodes from the fallen man's impact, I love the way slow -motion photography was used in the 1970s , in dreamy and hypnotic. The cool and funny black dudes spew a great one inlay, while the slimy hairy pieces of the white basket come to an unpleasant end. I love it, my 10/10 rating. If it ever comes out on the dvd, start buying me.
