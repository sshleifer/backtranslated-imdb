As someone who spent hours behind the scenes of North London in an attempt to avoid terrible congestion, the film immediately appealed. Put in my interest what was in London at the end of the 1970s, and you have a prerequisite for my version of the TV sky! On paper, the film dragged all the right boxes, and when he was watching "The Knowledge", the real movie itself lived, if not exceeded, my high expectations. I was visually surprised how London was different then (I lived in Islington in the 1990s, long after the area changed gentrification). It really hit the dirty, frayed and irritated heels. London may still have a poor housing estate, but the general feeling of place is much cleaner, brighter and more enjoyable today (based on what this film shows rather than my own memories). Of course, as for the story and the acting, the top marks go to Nigel Hawthorne as Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! She behaves deliberately unpredictably, alternating between absolutely equal gravity and surrealistic thought games to remember the knowledge-based boys when they test them after the test. Overall, it was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back to a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you are not particularly interested in London around 1979, you will still be delighted with the funny dialogue and sympathetic characters of "The Knowledge".
