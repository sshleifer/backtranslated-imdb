This is definitely a movie that will keep you thinking of everyday struggles one can go through every day. Great playing of two main roles is another example and you won't regret seeing this movie. It's a gratifying story of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life in terms of a wheelchair seat. Their friendship is being tested, as are their spirits when they get into an apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who likes friends or want to see a wonderful and delightful movie that avoids all clich√©s and pitfalls and not soaks once.
