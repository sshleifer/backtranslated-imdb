Look at this movie to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heart and scary at the same time when it says from start to finish. This movie made him famous and I absolutely recommend it: D It's very fun, the music is bad and you'll laugh together with Shahrukh here ... You really will be afraid of heroes and heroines and you will strangely identify with at least one character. You will feel sad and happy and at the same time relieve yourself and worry. Check out this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and beautiful food and have a day. And after you see the movie, play songs and scenery in your mind ... forever.
