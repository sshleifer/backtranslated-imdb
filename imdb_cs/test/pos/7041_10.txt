I love Meatballs! Amazing characters and annoying situations make this loved one. Bill Murray is hysterical and you have to love that race for 4 miles in the end! The overall classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back remarkable memories of the camp and deals with the experience of rejection by stupid peers and the empowerment has brought it to a likeable adult. Tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko consultants. This is the kind of film where you repeat key phrases between friends for years. Also, nothing overtly raw and what a sweet late 70s soundtrack make to the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about Meatballs; it's a classic. Be warned in advance! All the sequels are ugly stink bombs that simply bought title rights for marketing. They have no connection with Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
