Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak sound track, it is much better than its competitors at the time, "Octopussy". Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's smallest popular movie bond). NSNA is rich in clever dialogue, wit, cleverness, sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing criminals in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA features a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as, "Mr. Bean." T For this I wouldn't trade any pictures from Moore. However, earlier efforts by Connery / Bond (except "Thunderball") are excellent. <br /> <br />
