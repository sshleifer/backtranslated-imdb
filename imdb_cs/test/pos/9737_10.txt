I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watching the series again on DVD brings such memories. Each 15-minute episode represents the adventure of our hero Flash, the beautiful Dale Arden, and the intrepid dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every turn: Shark Men almost drowned him, facing a fiery Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in mortal danger in a static room! The characters are still fun: Buster Crabbe is every bit of a blonde dream and Jean Rogers is a fine and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still conspires to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan Hawk Men still has her flourishing laughter and angel wings, and Ming Merciless, Emperor of the Universe, still gives everyone an evil eye and horror. This series would probably not interest kids today with its hokey effects - oh that ship! - But it's fun nostalgia for those who liked it for the first time. Actors play it and don't play children. I appreciate the fact that young viewers were expected to read the synopsis that had big words in them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. It's a lot of fun to come back to this classic science fiction series.
