The story begins with a soldier being transported to a desert city, and then comes back in time to tell the story of how he came to this place. He began as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After starvation and / or dying of thirst he came to a leopard who somehow became his friend's breast. He brought him food, and long before the soldier had become almost totally wild, so acute he had been linked to an animal. But all things end, and the man has decided that he must leave the animal. Very special movie, well written and portrayed. Beautiful scenery from Jordan and Utah that did not always blend perfectly, but who cares.
