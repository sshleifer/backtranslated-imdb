Dirty Dancing builds on the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family who spend the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We see herself appearing when she falls in love with a dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The film is full of beautiful dance (that is, the title!) Some great music and amazing scenery. It handles some difficult problems with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!) Happy, fabulous, good feeling! You know how it ends from the beginning, but it's not here. It is a journey, a journey that touches every family member. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV. remembered!
