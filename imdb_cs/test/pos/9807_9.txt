You got it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend across the film, even at the beginning when he went to California. His mother knew about Bobby and did not discourage Mike from leaning on Bobby, because imaginary friends are common with young children. Therefore, both received gastric pain at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. At the end Mike let Bobby go. "King" was arrested. Mike could continue without Bobby. That's why Mike's mother didn't seem to be disturbed when Mike received a postcard (Mike wrote and sent by post) from Bobby's Ol 'West tourist station and other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card and looked at the postmark. What a great mother does the best she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> And 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories ...
