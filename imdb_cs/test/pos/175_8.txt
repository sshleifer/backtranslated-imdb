Interesting cartoon included on DVD "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". Especially I like the way the color was used in the background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, how certain ... um, finger gesture ... ever got through censors. It is true that the gesture in question was seen much less in 1937 than today. Do you think anyone would notice - in addition to the animators - especially because they are seen in the scene three times! And on the basis of context, I suspect that its inclusion was intentional, something that the animators slipped just to see if the censors noticed!
