It was amazing. As a librarian and participant in the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund event on Thursday night, October 18, I had the privilege to see a preliminary screening of The Kite Runner. The release of the film was delayed due to concerns about the well-being of the actors involved. I am grateful that NYLA could continue as planned. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, I feel it was a masterpiece. I think it had so much impact on me as Stanley Kubrik's Clockwork Orange, though it's much less graphics - much less. There is no comparison between the dreadful, shocking violence and rape shown in the Watchmaker's Orange, and the small amount of violence that actually appeared in Kite Runner; only the subject and consequences for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more details about the violence and rape of children and how it was dealt with on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this film was fantastic; One of the best movies I've seen. The depiction of Afghan boys flying their dragons captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is very serious, and the film carries the audience's emotions into the subject without the many horrible "Hollywood touches" that destroyed other movies. Although the inverted cart of pomegranates was an obvious symbolic symbol for me (<br /> <br />) I must finally mention the perfection of the audio track. The recitation of the poetry boy Rumi as the two main characters flee the country during the Russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - indeed showed the power of these poems. I urge someone to watch the subtitles ignore in this scene as much as you can and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know what language Amir quotes, whether his normal dialect of Dari's Persian dialect is the same as the original Persian dialect Rumi. Also note the sound you hear each time you cut the kite. I found a deep, distinctive sound, even though the librarians who were with me didn't notice it. I can't help but wonder if the dragons actually make such a sound when they're "cut" or when it gives a vibration / sound feel to the kite flyer during the competition.
