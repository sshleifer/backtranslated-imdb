Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) was taken to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He's terribly burned from backup. His sister Hana (Juliette Binoche) leans toward him, body and mind because she is afraid, quite rightly, that she can be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count begins to tell Hanes about his recent past. He seems to have worked in government capacity in Africa where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Though they tried to avoid, they fell in love. After a short matter, Katherine called it ends, leaving Count Desolate. Even so, they would both meet again, under overwhelming circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls on a man Sihk in a British bomb unit. But war is inexorably raging. Can love exist when the world is in riots? This is a huge film based on an equally subtle but intricate novel. The storyline has many story lines that are beautifully woven together, each of which is beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many unforgettable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, as a burning victim, so a man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also pretty cool as a woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she deservedly earned an Oscar that was presented to her because her sister is a bright example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is absolutely beautiful as well as costumes, direction and production. If you missed this movie, fix it soon. The English patient remains one of the greatest successes in film for centuries.
