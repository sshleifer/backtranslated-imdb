Everyone has the right to an opinion. The only critic who counts is himself. I think it's a great movie. Much better than the original. In Caddyshack, Rodney Dangerfield is funny but unpleasant. He was asked to continue, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows that "less is more". He is funny, but a man with real family problems, a more rounded person. It's not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. Actually on some points, I'm sorry about Jackie Mason, especially when his daughter goes to him. She has a good soundtrack, and overall, I'm sorry. Good end series. <br /> <br /> In the TV show "Alf" Alf says he was shouting in "Affection Terms". Wife, Kate Tanner, played by Anne Schedeen, also says she was crying at "Caddyshack 2".
