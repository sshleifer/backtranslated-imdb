-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" refers to the well-known (at least in Spain) story of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegic who has been killed (helped by some friends) after 28 years of prostitution by his condition. The judges have repeatedly denied their petitions about active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> -Facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes the FILM OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone is talking about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone loves and the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and harasses the Catholic community and quadriplegics of life lovers. A star was born. -Facts (III): The intensity and quality of the "Mar Adentro" actors are just amazing, and it is a miracle how we must look at the same bad. young actors in most Spanish latest movies. I don't know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or great imitator (there's absolutely a difference between one thing and another); his work is just as impressive as Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda, or the work of all the visiting stars. This is (the actors choose) the strong side of Amenábar. -Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar has learned his lesson in Cinema School, no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain. He has good control over each of the technical aspects, knows what the audience wants, knows how to touch the right chord, even if he turns it into such a demagogue (as Spielberg is - from the idols of Amenabar)). <br /> <br /> -Facts (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", it looks like you have some problems with the moral problem the story tells. There is a trap in this kind of pictures: you have to distinguish between film itself and moral concepts. If you don't like "Schindler's List", it doesn't mean you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or yes?). For me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (because it's a real story that makes it a lot more special). Generous, self-confident and everything but neutral (no matter what the Amberbar or Bardem said: those characters who are not in favor of euthanasia are not good at all!). 50% hard / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogue: "Mar Adentro" wouldn't be in my list of the top 50 Spanish movies ever. No one has a special merit in the story, but Ramon Sampedro himself. It's a movie. Becoming an international Spanish director, Alejandro Amenábar may live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to watch him shoot a simple story, without any final twists, without dead and dying live ... "Others" is still his best film. <br /> <br /> * My course: 7/10
