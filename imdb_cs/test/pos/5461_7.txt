The late shift was interesting for the HBO movie, which looked closely at the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who do not know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to know that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as a guest of TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams extinct because Leno, a frequent guest guest, was in the corner of one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helena Kushnick, and worked tirelessly to get her client to work. It's not often that we got behind the scenes of Hollywood machinations that were re-created for fun, but for the fans of these two nighttime superstars, this film gave a fascinating look at the very stormy period of late night television. According to this film, Letterman was virtually promised to work Carson himself, while NBC promised Leno's work and that is where Helen Kushnick came. The film features Leno as a kind of milquetoast that enabled his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and pretended to be ignorant of some of Helen's strong hits by some of the greatest NBC players and presents Letterman as this clever and savvy businessman who, despite Carson's support, was filmed by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly renew Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it's a performance that sharply sharpens, namely Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helena Kushnick, who keeps this film bubbling. Bates orders the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances, as a poisonous Hollywood agent who cuts her television managers. There is also a wonderful turn of Impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and a powerhouse Bates performance that is worth checking.
