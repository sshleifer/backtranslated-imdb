Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both parts of the Saturday night comedy show "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, Australian film icon and John Clarke, who we still see regularly on Australian TV alongside Brian Dawe. Crackerjack, the loser is about a guy in his early 30s (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual memebership at a local club bowl in order to get a couple of parking spaces for which he uses himself and rents to others as cheap parking in inner cities. The club falls on hard times and pulls all the resources and members together, Jack, gets a phone call that tells him to turn to the next Saturday dish match or lose his membership (and then his parking lot) <br /> <br /> I wont spoil the rest, but the movie is a humorous, light heart and contains all the good aussie movie it should. <br /> <br /> If yours is not an Australian, then some of the jokes and humor will undoubtedly confuse you if they are Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit down on Crackerjack. kopii! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Amazing movie! <br /> <br />
