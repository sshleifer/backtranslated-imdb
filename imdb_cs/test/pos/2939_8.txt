The American Next Top Model is a great reality in every sense. She has a great hostess, has great guests, great productions and some of the best professionals in the modeling world who contribute to something they have not yet achieved: they represent a true American Top Top model. Of course, this is not something easy, so the US and the world have 10 parallel and fighting best models in this cruel world. It is clear, however, that his intention is not to introduce the American next-generation model, but yes, another American pop model. The show combines a lot of models with no experience with different personalities and great personal, professional and financial problems, giving them the chance to bring a dream into life or make their lives worthy. Obviously, Tyra Banks uses everything for its advantage, gives it a dream, but in exchange for it gains audience and more popularity. Anyway, he deserves it because he is intelligent, and if I can say that, he pioneered this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give opinions, distinguish himself from other models and hostesses of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL series. In Brazil, as an example, Fernando Motta is his host and "once in a while" -Top Model. He doesn't even have 1/10 Tire professional skills that hold Tyra Banks on top. Tyra has a professional and personal knowledge of what he says and is a great mentor because he not only criticizes but points out the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom. <br /> <br /> The show does not suffer from major problems, it does and fulfills what it promises during cycles. In fact, the models selected for work at the exhibition are not the best unknown models of the whole country, because Tyra Banks is betting on the difference and is right because she (and a good part of her audience) believes it is time to model some direct parameters. During these cycles, he and his team organize fair negotiations where the weakest leaves and promising new chances to prove their skills, but they have to do it quickly, otherwise they lose it. Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who should or should not win, even though he is against people's opinion. He knows that the one who wins will be famous, but he has very few opportunities to be a truly world-class top model. Like she knows that some times, second place is more valuable than first, because 1st place wins the title, but the second doesn't get the stigma title. He hardly makes mistakes when deciding the future of any model during an exhibition. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the show is a bit tired of some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it's boring and we see that it is bored, so it must be to do if he wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> The show explores the fashion and modeling world, but it's also fun for those who live off it all. This gives an opportunity for some girls and also the market, and also gives great tips for those of the audience who share the same dream.
