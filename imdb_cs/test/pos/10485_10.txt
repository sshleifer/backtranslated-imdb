This quiet and unassuming Danish film, flawlessly directed, written, demonstrated and filmed, is the best example of cinematography and if there is a man who can watch BABETTE'S FEAST without touching a very basic level, they are the people I do not care about . The story is pretty simple. In the 1800s, two older girl ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) live in remote Jutland, where they sacrificed their lives, romantic opportunities, and personal happiness to continue their long-dead father's religious service to a small herd he served. One of the juvenile female admirers sends them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who have fled their homeland to meet the same fate. Although her services do not really require her, her sisters treat her as a maid and cook - and as the years have passed through her cleverness and tireless efforts to their advantage, she allows aging churches to stay together and sisters to live more comfort than they do. imagined; indeed, the whole village admires and depends on it. One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she won the lottery and is now a wealthy woman according to village standards. Knowing that her new wealth would mean her return to France, her sisters give her the wish that they could actually prepare French food and members of their small gathering. The food and evening that is being served is really the night you remember - but not for the reasons you might expect, because Babette is a feast for both body and soul, and it's her gift the love of the women taken by Her and the villagers who were so kind to her. The film is extremely versatile, detailed and detailed, but not presenting it. As the film progresses, we love characters in their simple devotion to God and their omnipotent human fragility, and the scenes in which Babette prepares the feast and in which food is consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly unforgettable. There were several films that used food as a metaphor for love, but no one would come to the simple art and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for body and soul. Highly recommended. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
