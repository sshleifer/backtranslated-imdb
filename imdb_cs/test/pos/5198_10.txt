Stalingrad is an amazing film that has behaved and directed, and rather on the ground, accessing various bizarre aspects of struggle and politics. This is, along with "Das Boot" one of the best war films (along with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("Winter War", in English, I believe)). It depicts the suffering of some German soldiers who fought - and died - in Stalingrad and its surroundings during World War II. No great heroic heroism, not emotional embarrassment, just fear of daily death in war. The mood of the movie is similar to the mood in "Das Boot," and that should give you some advice on what to expect. So, if you like realistic, non-Hollywood, war movies: Rent, buy, just make sure you see it! Finally, a note on the film: for some of the previous reviewers' information, I would just like to say that "Stalingrad" is not controlled by Wolfgang Petersen (who did "Das Boot")!
