Not sure why another commentary on this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am an Asian art student with love for Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie was very controversial and interesting. Yang Seung-up is one of (perhaps most) famous Korean artists and is still honored as a master. Given the storm of time he painted and his own conflicting nature, it's amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill. This film honors his talent while looking directly at his devious and somewhat self-defeating personality. My opinion's cinematography was beautiful, many of the panoramic images looked like Korean landscapes (which I found pretty conceit rather than "too articular") and I think Choi Min-sik portrayed Yang Seun-up with the necessary intensity and unpredictability. I highly recommend this film to art lovers and movie lovers.
