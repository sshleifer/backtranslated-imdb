- Surprisingly enjoyable movie <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg in Italy robbed a gold vault and, fortunately, robbery is successful for them and gets rid of it without much trouble. Before a group can celebrate how Steve plays Ed Norton he decides he wants gold for himself and pulls Cout De 'Ta to the band and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices let the group think he's dead, but fortunately the group isn't dead. A year later we return to the story where the band tracked down Norton and decided to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the film with plans to steal its gold and settle the score. It was a surprise to me, it was all that was typical of an unforgettable summer movie, but it was truly unforgettable and fun to watch. What I like is how intelligent and thoughtful plans in the film are and how the film seems realistic. Watching a trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie, but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they're all really well done. The second action is very long 20 minutes. a scene that has one of the best car chases. I like how realistic the persecution is and how everything happens in the old school style without the help of CGI. I personally get this car chasing more than a CGI filled chase in "Matrix 2". I remember watching videos of director F. Gary Gray and I always noticed how well they were and how he thought he would make a great filmmaker. I can't wait to see what he's doing with the sequel. Also, actors are doing a decent job and Seth Green is my favorite band. Another thing I loved was John Powell's excellent score, since this year I heard his score for "Robots" I was a fan and paid great attention to his music and the man is really good. He does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie music clich√©s and providing a very good score. I haven't seen the original that is based on so I can't really tell you how well it accumulates up to that one. <br /> <br /> -Yeah, that's a great popcorn movie that really has a brain unlike most summer movie crap that comes out. He has great characters, is funny and has John Powell's amazing score. If you like heist movies then you'll love this one <br /> <br /> - you know if I'm in a group that would call me a nice mike
