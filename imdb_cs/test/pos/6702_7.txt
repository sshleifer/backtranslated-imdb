Finally, I got to Lifeforce on DVD with widescreen format intact and hovering Henry Mancini to the maximum. After seeing Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I must say that the DVD version of "uncut" was great and unsatisfactory. The US version is * much * better than the DVD version (European?). The American version of lifeforce moves much faster (DVD edits are terrible. It feels like an unfinished cut). And many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, one "new" moment will almost destroy the entire movie when Caine (peter firth) meets a male alien in the cathedral. I like this scene, in the US version. On DVD, a male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo cheerful. It's the peak of merriment: <br /> <br /> "It will be much less frightening when you come to me!" male alien says in deep 1950s style voice. I was on the floor when I saw it. It just doesn't belong to the movie. The scene is a pure camp in an otherwise super serious movie. I'm glad Hooper (or anyone) cut the scene when the movie came out in North America. There are several changes that have been made to the American version, which makes Lifeforce much better and I wish the DVD had an American version. Editing is sharp and frantic, without being uncomfortable, and some places that have been boring in the US are even more boring on the DVD because they have added scenes. And the initial DVD credits are terrible. Much better in the US version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It's basically aliens who pit-stop above the ground and suck as much Lifeforce as possible. The movie has too many flat, non-inspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk), but it's fun when the action goes to London. The film really shines in these scenes. Hooper finally does what's great at: chaos, wildness, horror! Lifeforce was supposed to have more of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever made on film. It's also the best zombie movie ever. Zombies are hungry (for life force, not body) and are crazy and agile and scary. Not a slow moving boredom of other zombie movies. Also, many people have criticized the end, but I love it. He leaves you tall and dry, as one of the victims of a life force. T or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder he was bombing because it was a journey ahead of his time with his super nihilistic viewpoint! <br /> <br /> It's not great about DVD. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no accessories. It's great to see the movie in widescreen format. I just hope they release a clean, sharp American version of the Hooper and Dyksters on the DVD.
