My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his production company Studio Ghibli was at the time when the English-language version of Spirited Away was released 7 years ago. What a beautifully creative and unique film experience! So on this note, I managed to get a friend from my cinema to see this new Miyazaki movie with me mainly because she loves all the things of Disney (the American distributor of this movie). All I can say is "Wow!" What wonderful visuals about the way the water is depicted as the ocean ... and how the character of the title changes from goldfish to ... and see how the behavior of some characters changes ... and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choice. Does everything make sense? No, but that is part of a child's spell that penetrates the whole body. There are lots of funny scenes about Ponya and the boy and many other people they meet. I think I wrote too much, so I recommend Honyo Miyazaki Ponyo.
