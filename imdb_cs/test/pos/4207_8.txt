*** SPOILERS *** Although the movie "They Make Me a Crime" is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield anti-hero classics like "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his latest and a very underrated "On Ran All The Way" in 1951 is a film that defined his career from that moment until his untimely death on May 21, 1952 at the age of 39. Garfiled plays the role of Johnnie Bradfield's lightweight champion and later Jack Dorney's fugitive, who is innocent of the murder he is accused of, even though he was declared officially dead. Jonnie's manager Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who was about to expose his public warrior Johnnie Bradfield lies about him, being one woman guy, as well as non-drinking mom's boy. Dr. Gleckler broke the bottle over McGee's head that killed him because Jonnie was a nearly dead drunk with several women in his hotel suite. Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie Goldie's girlfriend, Ann Sheridan, but Doc burned on a sharp and Johnnie's watch was mistaken for him as Johnnie. He said he would stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,700.00 out of $ 10,000.00 from Johnnie's money he had for this big piece of advice. Malvin told Johnnie to take a new identity and from now on he called Jack Dorney and went to hell from New York; Talking about slim shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels along the tracks from New York to Arizona, where he ends up at Rancho Rafferty Date, where most of the movies take place. If it wasn't for John Garfield in the lead role as Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 at the time, brought the best of everyone in the movie. Even the transported Dead End Kids, I think we can call them Arizona kids here, acting was notches over what you would expect of them, and came across them as real and sensitive people, not a lot of tidal clowns like almost all of them films. All this because he is in the same phase, or filming a place, with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story that has a secret master acting like something, but not drawing any attention on yourself and ending not just behind bars, but in an electric chair. Eventually, Jack showed him the man he fought against the great fight and won all the dramas dramatically at the last minute, but with four brutal rounds he got the money for his newly founded family on a farm date including his girl Peggy, Gloria Dickson, opened the gas station. Putting European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, fighting his life and getting $ 2,000.00, that's $ 500.00 per round, for giving Jack all who looked at him as "Arizona Kids", Sometimes the strike is much braver and bolder than throwing. The fact that Jack could easily break Rutched, but not to show himself to the police, like Johnnie Bradfield's free killer. But instead he went as far as he could to get Rutchek to hand him over to help his friends show more than all the fighting he'd won in the boxing ring together. I didn't find the end of a film for one that was invented at all, but fit into the story. Cop Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack, had to live for years by sending an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told at the beginning of the film. Why did he know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder that he was accused and not sure if he found out in court that he was innocent, would he want to make the same horrible mistake again? It's easy to see in real life, why not in movies.
