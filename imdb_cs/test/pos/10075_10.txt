Watching this little movie is a joy from start to finish. The story is always fun, the tension never loses. The whole cast is amazing. The collaboration between Walken and Bracco works to perfection, it's almost like an echo of a classic novel. Bracco is very sexy and really funny as a cheater who fights for his independence. For some reason, did they give Walken a weird makeup and the weirdest hairstyle I could imagine? it's a kind of parody of Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry. It made me happy. It is the first film I saw Miguel Ferrer, probably one of the most valuable film actors of his generation. He is very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even Jamaican criminals look at the sight. I highly recommend this movie.
