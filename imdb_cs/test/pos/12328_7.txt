Flashes of lightning; a large cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: all appearing on the screen before credits begin to open, and despite these rather naff elements, one dark night is not as raw as it might seem. Meg Tilly (sister Jennifer) plays the pretty student Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in the mausoleum as part of her dedication to The Sisters exclusive high school. What Julie doesn't realize is that another 'sister' plan to scare her with some ghoul jokes? the power of frightened young women. Of course, this is not the most original set-up, but fortunately there are enough inventive touches to help distinguish this film from the competition. a look at the objects of everyday life embedded in the walls of Raymar's apartment and the ghastly way the moldy corpses swim through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during an excellent final. Hal Trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and Tom Burman's amazingly special special effects also contribute immensely to the chilling atmosphere.
