Poetic exploration of human state without dialogue. The anti-hero, a man builds contraption to escape the marauders band, from the wasteland of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to calm down for its survival. There crosses the road with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, "Professional" and "Mission: Impossible" fame. The man is saved by a crazy old genius who lives in the strength of his own design. The man and old genius who use their wits are able to keep Brute and his ilk in check, but they realize that it's just a matter of time before their defense is threatened, so they take a break. This is a heavily underestimated story of a desperate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and clever humor. Of all films of this kind, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (featuring Yul Brenner as a buff knife-fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most artistically crafted. Copies of videos are hard to find, I would put my left eye ball for one. If your local art house sometimes revives this movie, I highly recommend that you break any engagement to be able to see the big one.
