It was hard to put in words, how wonderful it was. Once in a while you'll see a movie that keeps you. "You're alone" is the movie (for me). The film is always in my head and in my heart. Every day, I play the scenes mentally and analyze them and go through emotions again as if I had seen it for the first time. I didn't like anything about the movie. Úžasný soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very emotionally stirring !!! It was impressive and impressive. I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the biggest I've ever seen. I admired the power of Brittany (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The brand line is "When Your Darkest Moments Come To Life". We never know what we can do. Everyone says I would never do it when we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of everything and these films are getting into this subject. The honesty of the film can be my absolute favorite part. Thank you Gorman Becherd for the perfect work of art !!!!
