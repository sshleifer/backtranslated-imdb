I saw this movie with an open mind, didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and acted so that it is a wonderful watch every minute. People don't seem to act, more like real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie. There are some wonderful moments where to laugh or laugh, some jokes can be dry but they are presented in very visible fashion. Highly recommended!
