One of my favorite movies of all time has seen him three times. It's a great job of summarizing Isrelai's lives, the Israeli humor and the seriousness and the many problems Israelis are going through. A versatile theme that wants to be accepted and accepted for whom you are. Good subtle humor, and this is the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic, and says a lot about Isrlaei culture, and irnonicness, contradictions and humor, with a great actor in it, Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a film perfect for virtually all, a family movie, friend / girlfriend movie, and also says that, unlike Israeli culture, they want to be accepted, most of all as an important family, with all its diversity and imperfections . <br /> <br /> Great great movie.
