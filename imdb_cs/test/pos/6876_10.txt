I know that Walter will never love another set.I was in my 30 when I first saw this sweet, cute and shamelessly romantic movie. I had it from the first scene, and all the way to the end. self; Glenda responded to Walter step by step in witticisms, and Richard Benjamin added a sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well. On the way there were many actors we all acknowledge, we do their usual brilliance. There are a few lines I've used over the years, but I won't say anything about them. I'm sure you'll know which of the two I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your squeeze (if it's as happy as mine, for which I'm grateful), and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70s. You won't be disappointed. However, I feel that I am preaching to the church because everyone who loves Walter already owns it. I am very happy to be finally on DVD.
