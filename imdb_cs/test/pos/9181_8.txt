OK, OK, I must say I'm impressed. It's hard to say what I'm more impressed with: it has the ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch my eyes and the film itself. Either way, "Hitch" was pretty damn good. Hey, it was good enough to look twice. Will Smith was fun and good. Kevin James was just cheerful and absolutely necessary for the film. Like this movie centered around Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James it's just not the same thing. The story is: Hitch is a wrestler who helps a boy woo a girl. His job is to create a chance for a girl to notice the guy if he doesn't. After the meeting, the rest is all to the guy to make or break the relationship. It only works on recommendation and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time, and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), the Paris Hilton figure. While this story unfolds, Hitch himself has eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent, flirty columnist who has nothing to do with the relationship. they merge into a wreck. Of course no love story is complete without a compulsory misunderstanding, misunderstanding, or accident that would send a girl chasing a girl. Fortunately, they do it concise and unhappy. Hitch was a fun and fun movie that flowed very well and rolled together without a hitch.
