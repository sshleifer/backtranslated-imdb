I went and saw the movie last night after I was spoken by a few of my friends. I admit that I was reluctant to see it, because of what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played very well on the character Jake Fischer and Kevin Costner played with such professionalism Ben Randall. The good film is that he can play with our emotions. He did exactly that. The whole theater (which was sold out) was overcome with laughter in the first half of the film and moved to tears during the second half. As I stepped out of the theater, I saw not only many women in tears but also many full-fledged men who were desperate not to let anyone see them cry. This movie was great and I suggest you see it before the judge.
