Though less than forty minutes long, it's one of the best directorial and feature stories I've ever seen. In less than 45 minutes, it will do what most of the films cannot have more than 90. <br /> <br /> It's the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10. They come from a poor farm in Mississippi. They are both trapped in the war and in the conflict of duties of the love of family. It brought tears to my eyes, especially since the whole film was so well-behaved and directed, and it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this movie as excellent!
