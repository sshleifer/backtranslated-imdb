Hollywood movies since the 1930s have worked homosexuals as lepers. The condemnation of homosexuality by the film industry only reflects what the repressive society considered an ideology of its day. For example, in 1962 Otto Preminger melodrama "Advice and Consent," straight actor Don Murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than admit his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters covered a lot of space from "Advice and Consent." In the 1997 film "In and Out," (** 1/2 out ****), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a gay teacher who comes out of the closet for his wedding day. While conservative Hollywood from ancient times predicted that the Congress Front in "Advice and Consent" had to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood dictates that a gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maked. Basically "In & Out" preaches good citizenship in a politically correct comedy outfit. Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Scott Rudnick promote honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. High School Teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline from "The Big Chill") will only be happy after he comes out of the closet, as is his fiancé Emily (Joan Cusack), who is one of the fat but now thin ones will be feel happy when she can ditch her diet. Finally, the film claims that direct society accepts homosexuals when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and sincerity about themselves. Happily angry gay tabloid reporter played by direct actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded commentary. Rudnick's light scenario adorns the real life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to the high level. school teacher. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond, Brad Pitt style bimbo type actor, wins an Oscar for impersonating a soldier's leg. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his reception speech. No doubt he'll stop there, honest Cameron reveals to a live TV audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia and horror occurred when the media descended to the sleepy city of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would no-name high school English teacher of sexual deviation trigger such massive media fears?) Among those reporters lurking Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck from "High Road to China"), and he wants to make a weekly exclusive one on Howard. But Howard does not want anything to do with the witch-hunting media, especially with the annoying Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everyone, including his fiancé and his mom. Malloy persists because he smells scapula. Revelation turned the green leaf upside down. High School Director Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) is nervously writhing with all the media. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage is not immediate, he would have to give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter bets Howard that his marriage to Emily will be at the last minute and he will be there to record the result on the camera. Howard resorts to audio cassettes about macho men. He tries to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are futile. He blamed him. And then there's Peter Malloy, who annoys him to get rid of his homosexuality. Finally, on the altar before God, Howard bursts. Of course, bride-to-be Emily Montgomery's on the floor of Howard's homosexual confession. Predictably, the school fires Howard, but he shows up at graduation. Drake also appears and rushes to Brackett's defense. Not only did the school strip Howard out of her job, but she also awarded him a teacher's prize. Drake appeals to the director and wins Howard unanimous community support. The biggest flaw in Rudnick's scenario is Howard. Rudnick created a character that is too chaste to be true, whether gray or straight. Howard Brackett seems like a saint more than a sinner. It helps one student to gain entry to college and coaches the coaching team. How often do you hear how an English teacher doubles as a coach? They all adore Howard High School. She has no middle bone in her body. Further, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they too frightened to come to their defense? No, "In & Out" is not focused exclusively on homosexual audiences. Oz, whose credits include cute comedies like "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter", as well as Rudnick meet on a politically correct doe. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment movie. The filmmakers show no interest in what Howard or Peter Malloy might prefer a homosexual lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in getting a thin assumption: Is he gay or not? Match community response to answer. Finally, when Howard admits to being gay, filmmakers devote the rest of the films to show how conservative he is, Norman Rockwell-City can accept despite his difference. The most shocking scene in In & Out "is probably when tabloid reporter Malloy does a lip lock on Howard." Straight guys kissing each other in a film about a homosexual crisis are as cheerful as they are fake. Kline and Selleck compare their faces to what appears to be a frontal collision rather than a closed mouth kiss. Nothing like the controversial British film "Priest" in 1994 "In & Out" does not appear as an engaging but stressed piece of social propaganda with a message in order. If "Ellen" were not the TV equivalent, "In & Out" would probably be directed to television as a new situational comedy. Watching "In & Out" is not so much about how to deal with the question of gays or equals, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equality of opportunity for health and suffering for queers and oxen.
