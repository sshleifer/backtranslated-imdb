This is the first movie I ever owned on video, and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as bright as she was twelve years old than ever before, and Mickey Rooney gave a real dimension to Mi Taylor, and Donald Crisp was as strong as Mr. Mr. Amazing Anne Revere, as Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After nearly 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at jokes, loot The Pie, and we love Velvet for the spirit and the ability of love it manifests. I love it as an adult, just as I loved him as a child. Need for every family video collection.
