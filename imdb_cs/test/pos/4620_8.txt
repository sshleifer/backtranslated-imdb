All those that identify it as a simple 'Elephant' burst - there are no other remarks that you can make to the film on its own merits as an individual film (regardless of its apparent similarities with other films). > <br /> All who question the validity of the film - in terms of its stereotypical characters (compulsory homosexual, female athlete, disabled child, etc.) - I'm not sure how long it was when you were at school - but no matter what how amateur acting can be - events that go are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. And all who overlook the film as simple: just six teenagers with regular teenage anxieties that push one over the other ... someone stopped thinking and noticed that the girl who took her life wasn't in fact one of those six! As one comment points out, the screen time was about 2min max (excluding the final scenes). I think that the purpose of the film is not just to be a problem of teenage anger, and how far can someone have it - but also that it is not obvious who is always at risk of committing such an act (suicide) ...
