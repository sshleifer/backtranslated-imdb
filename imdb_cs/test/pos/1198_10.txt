When I was younger, I saw the end of the TV screen. I've been watching the last 5 minutes of the movie. And it really impressed me. I got goose pimples and told myself that I was supposed to watch the movie. And I did it and I say: This movie is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this movie is one of the most important: "Make love, no war". This film is a true masterpiece. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. The last song is one of the saddest and happiest I've ever listened to. I almost felt that I was joining the crowd. All I have to say: "SUN SHINE, PLEASE SUN SHINE IN"
