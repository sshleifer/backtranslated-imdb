In England, we often feel very attached to British films that we love because we are used to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where Virtual Sexuality is set, I felt very emotional about him. Characters in Virtual Sexuality, especially women, are exactly what British teenagers are, I felt like in a movie. I immediately related to Alex's character from the film, his timidity being quite common with most British teenage boys, especially around girls. Virtual sexuality made me feel really good as one of the only British films that isn't about gangsters, nor about middle class, but about people watching the movie, the average teenagers. Americans would not feel emotional, but every British teenager should watch it. Everybody from London knows a part of town from the city, it's definitely a special place in my video!
