Haggard doesn't even have to be graded because he was never designed to be rated as an Oscar and never intended to win an Oscar (of course). If you just look at some of the things Bam and Bran have tried, as well as the fast-moving shots, they will find that the movie is more than just cky or jackass (though they are cool too). I definitely give this film 10 for pure enjoyment; Almost every scene made me laugh until my hips hurt like a falcon movie. If you haven't seen it, check it out and then buy it. Personally, my favorite character is brandon (falcone), is it just as smooth and natural and random that it is merry, great (with action figures) and makes London's funniest diamond wheel? Haggard is definitely a film that only competes with anchor and napoleon dynamite in total humor.
