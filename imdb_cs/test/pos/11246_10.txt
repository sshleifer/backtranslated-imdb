The fact that reviewers feel very negative about the show is an interesting fact in itself. If you don't like it, don't look at it. Some reviewers say you need to be stupid, fools or simple old primitives to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I'm not saying that all competitors are smart. They're smart and they're stupid. But I would argue that they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said it. There's so much about science of seducing girls. I'm sorry, but please remove all of those donkeys' sticks and see why you hate these people for threatening you. Those who are not interested in social sciences, and more specifically the science behind them, will clearly omit the boat altogether. One thing is clear: Clubs are not the only places where girls meet. I personally think that women who are worth not even going to clubs, so they won't fall for prey for men like the ones we see at the show. But what are men like these ???? In addition to those whose stinks play, they are men's epitome. They are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. They are men who take up their own sexuality. These men don't want friends to break with them, and these men don't say "OK" to "let's be friends." <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar ???? In fact, these are the guys you're afraid of when you take a special long-term girlfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (Again only those who have a "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... worth laughing! <br /> <br /> If you went to the club and you actually met people around you, you should have fun with this show. Look, I'm the loss of so much hatred at this show. My best guess is that it exacerbates the uncertainty of men who have had bad club experiences, or threaten men who believe that women are beautiful beings who want their own person to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure fun and the best of all is her REAL. It is a very perceptive look at the latest state of sexual psychology. Sexual role has never been so different since then, and this show provides a very real look at it, <br /> <br /> I think it actually takes some intelligence to make something positive out of this show. <br /> <br /> This show appeals to a certain target market, and if you're out of it, then I think you shouldn't tune in to the show. We can say it about any other shows, but we don't? <br /> <br /> Develop, ApolloHelios
