I remember this movie got a lot of flak from reviewers when it was new. Letterman and Leno objected. Letterman called it (paraphrase) the biggest film waste he had ever seen, and Leno said he was looking at him alone. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest at his show, so he didn't seem to take anything too personally. A re-release DVD, with opinions and such from those involved, might be interesting, even if I suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captured the nation and are not coming back soon. I preferred Letterman to pretend to be Leno, but I could never buy it. They never rose above the cartoon and never accepted them as actors. By comparison, Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in "Nixon" by Oliver Stone comes to mind as a personification that may have been laughing in the first moments, but which at least seemed plausible after the first moments of amusement subsided. The highlight of the show was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as great as Alec Baldwin's entry (and quick departure) as Blake at Glengerry Glen Ross. They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this. I know he was mostly not involved in the events portrayed in this film, and most viewers will know his reputation that Johnny Carson doesn't need any introduction. But more of a connection, why Dave and Jay and all the comedians worship Johnny, would this slacker she misses in that it was a gossip movie. Guess I should read the book ... Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, came across as nothing more than Rich Little to imitate Johnny Carson. I'm telling you what, after watching this movie, then watching either Letterman or Leno show, all I want to do is tear up Johnny Carson's DVD and see the real thing.
