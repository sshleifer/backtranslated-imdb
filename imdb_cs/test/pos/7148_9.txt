This is an amazing movie ... it's funny, dark, engaging, provocative, innocently naughty and generally fun all around. I don't know I've seen, like before ... "The Rapture", or maybe one of Todd Solondz's black "comedies" or even the recent "Teeth" movie to mind ... but these are all bitter, ugly little gems. "Franklins", despite the darkness around the edges, can have a perfectly honest and pure heart. The story is similar to "Low Down Dirty Shame" by John Waters, only this movie is different in that it actually has a story, and something to say also, outside Waters' juvenile "Sex is not dirty (snicker, nudge- The conservative, repressed family is undergoing a drastic change as a result of a road accident and is suddenly no longer so conservative ... in fact they are finally truly happy, probably the only people in their city (or perhaps the whole world)) who they are. Why this is the case would be to spoil the movie; Simply put, everyone should see it, though of course only people who are already being sold on what it would be in a positive and hopeful spirit. Teresa Willis gives a particularly unforgettable and brave performance as an exciting mother who appears as a butterfly when she is released, both she and Robertson Dean deserve a kudos for their unbelievable genuinely sincere performances (not to mention the frequent and extensive nudity and sexual scenes), they turn what might be a witty joke involving "deviant sexual practice" into a moving, believable and torn-off moment. Aviva as a daughter is a standout and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, anxiety and speech patterns of her age. Vince Pavia as "himbo" mystery brother is good looking and functional, although his story and how everyone reacts to him is rewarding than his actual actions. Mari Blackwell as best friend with Franklin's mother is amazingly cool, confused and even sympathetic in a role that could be overcome. <br /> <br /> Technically the film looks fantastic, all bright colors and wide -Open locales ... it looks like it could be shot Hi-def ... if so, the line got very thin, it looks like film. There's a lot of talking and a lot of philosophical, a little preaching (moreso, I would imagine a viewer who disagrees with film politics), but this movie says a lot of things they need to say. If people are not afraid to listen and think. The arguments that are taking place are clever and well thought out, especially the refusal to demonize religious NE-religious parties. The end is on the ambiguous side I found somewhat disappointed somehow ... I think it would work better if it had an author (as Jay Floyd is because he produced, wrote and directed) due to more functional denouement, some solution, but then again, probably there is not one when it comes to building people with different beliefs against each other. Likewise, it was a moving, unforgettable final image that let me suffocate - success. Meanwhile, I am so glad that Mr. Floyd made this film and looks forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Check it out.
