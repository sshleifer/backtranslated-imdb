While most movies that put people against the terrible extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci-Fi, and an excellent movie all around. Perhaps the most popular aspect of the film is lighting. This film makes great use of many different colors, shades and light intensities that set the mood and give a unique feel to the film itself, something other than "normal" film lighting that we are generally exposed to. Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent way and skilfully avoids the routine display of a hardened criminal. After all, the film is about Riddick's personal journey, so fortunately Vin won't drop the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but they were all in amazing performances that revived diverse characters with unique jokes and mannerisms. Pitch Black is a perfect example of how to make a great movie with over budget resources. Special effects are more than adequate, but they are by no means the only focus, as is the case with many "big markets". It's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provocative story, rather than telling an average story that uses a sci-fi flash.
