Just like the circle of human condition, 2001 begins at the beginning, skips in the middle and progresses to the end, right where we started. Noticing the weakness of the words compared to the image, Kubrick wisely issues a dialogue, prefers the power and essence of the scenery, and allows the viewers to intelligently decipher. Or not, depending on the audience. Monolith in cinematographic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution and success. Taking into account the film's ambitions (film about everything) and the success rate that the film has achieved, a very good argument can be made that this film is the greatest of all films. <br /> <br />
