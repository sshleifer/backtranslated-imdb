I saw this show when I was younger. It's a really good show to watch. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years old. Barney is definitely super DE duper. B.J. is pretty funny. Babie Bop is very cute. Children are also very cool. This show is about learning about numbers that are a little like sesame street, but about a different type of show and characters like Barney Purple Dinosaur, B.J. A Yellow Dinosaur With A Baseball Cap On His Head, And A Baby Bop A Cute Green Dinosaur With A Pink Bow. The first that started was the very old Barney and Friends show. But the other one was different from the new episodes. Also the last in 2000 was the new scene of Barney Park. They also have a show of Barney at Universal Studios in Florida where you see Barney, B.J., and Baby Bop and then when the show is done you get to play, shop and meet Barney. It's a very good show to watch this show when you learn about the many things that you will like a movie, and a live show at Universal Studios Florida.
