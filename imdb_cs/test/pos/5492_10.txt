One of the best movies I've seen ... A good screenplay, the original story of a man who is being persecuted by the JFK assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later, he wants another antisocial mad assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner on the way, to the crazy militants who plan, lie and murder someone in his way that will stand in the way of his journey. The film is accompanied by a great memorable score and a limited but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult it is to have a romantic life in this kind of job. Malchovich is great, certainly that many other candidates might have played the role he played, but how many of them could have acted with the sophistication and intellect he displayed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I thought it was a great movie ... it's always on TV, I have to watch it ... and I have it on DVD! I am a big fan of Eastwood, which has just encouraged his already wonderful career and Malchovich's best role so far! <br /> <br />
