Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku Daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) That was on my list a long time ago, and then I finally scored a copy back on Ebay. It was never on DVD and what I got from Ebay was a high quality DVD-R with which I am satisfied. The film is, in my opinion, the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on pornography. A woman responds to a porn movie ad and goes with the producer to where she is filmed. Porn is definitely real, with annoying Japanese pixelation that tries to hide hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. After the film is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she gets over her head with a baseball bat and returns to the room and scatters in slow footage and in one of the most disgusting scenes, male porn videos guy screwing her into an open wound in the chest. This is after both legs have been separated, arm and several other lovers. This film overcomes Guinea Pig with a long shot, in fact not even close to realism, although the cheap gore effects shown in this movie. This is really one of the best fake snuff movies I've ever seen, if not the best. Now I must warn you that if you are not in this matter, you should stay far. This film is very strong, and with real sex, it is in a very sick way, erotic to some extent. And I mean in a very sick way. But wherever you come up on this subject, this movie brings home goods and I would definitely recommend that you look for it. After reading about the movie, I was expecting something very strong, but it overcame the bunch.
