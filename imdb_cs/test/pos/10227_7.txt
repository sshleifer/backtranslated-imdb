It's a horror story all right. But maybe not as you know it. The real monsters in this movie are people. While monsters are human and prey. As weird it can sound I see it as "Monsters Inc" for horror movie fans. Sure, the effects are std horror movie, the monsters are there like in every monster based movie, Gore is also there, there is also a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see a glimpse of Cillian Murphy as Dr Jonathan Crane in Batman starts here - or is it the other way around?). And it's Decker & c who are evil. Monsters mainly want to think about their own business, to distract the distracting people more or less misleading, they want to join the company there. By the end of the movie, they're actually coming up like pretty little monsters (and a dog) - not what you expected from the first scenes.
