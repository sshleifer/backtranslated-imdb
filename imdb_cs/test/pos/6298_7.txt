I have read that Paolo Sorrintin's inspiration for Love Consequences comes from the simple observation of a Brazilian hotel entrepreneur himself and speculating what he can do there. Similarly, the film is developing. We see the existence of Titty, who lives for 8 years in a hotel in Switzerland. He is secret and avoids friendship. His life is controlled by order and regularly. The truth about its existence is gradually revealed to us when its world finally falls apart. Titty's secret is central to the consequences of love, and it works because of much of it. excellent performance of Toni Servillo. His character becomes all the more interesting for us as little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week that he has no imagination. Although some criticize the dialogue for not being naturalistic, I think it doesn't matter - it's not such a movie and I think the script is great. Working with the camera is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the film will lose its way in later scenes because the secret of Titty's existence is revealed to us and how its world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are as good as the previous build.
