This show is brilliant. It's a modern day Married ... with kids. The scripts are funny because they're smeared with clever sarcasm. They are also realistic, dealing with the problems that many teenagers face today. Besides being a burden you don't have to be the biggest parent in the world and how to deal with it the best? At the same time, it can remain light and fun. Which is a very pleasant and welcome change with all the drama and action on television these days. It's something you can sit in front of for 30 minutes and relax, laugh and relate. It's not the strangest comedy in the world. yet you will be laughing at the episode at least several times. Michael Rapaport is headed like Dave Great. It fills the big shoes that a sarcastic scenario requires, and then some. He and Anita Barone (Vikki) have fantastic chemistry and are very well reflected. This show has a strong future if it is sold in the right target audience and put in the right time slot. Also, if Fox releases it on DVD, the following will be stronger and larger. (As a classic Scrubs example.)
