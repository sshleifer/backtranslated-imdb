Despite the apparent structural resemblance to The Simpsons - Loudly Fat Father, Housewifey Mom, 3 Kids, Pet, Typical Suburban Home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically contrary to The Simpsons. His enthusiastic use (and sometimes too many) of gags was his main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in Season 5 are spirally cheerful), others are less successful, come across equally fancy. And they can be annoying, especially if they don't approach the story. (Jesus' pieces are totally indecent and insulting) The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin fits into pure comedic gold, so much that Chris and Meg manage to fulfill only the role of compulsory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family. However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGLY terrible. Thank God it went straight to DVD. Unlike the tedious comparisons with permanent Simpsons, Seth MacFarlane's approach to Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically wrong and a lot more rough. Creator Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's point of view. I don't think it looks so bad that the details and accuracy of some spoofs are quite successful. All in all, a great series with a big big bowl of stinking ranch sauce chips and ass jokes.
