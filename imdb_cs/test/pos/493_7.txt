Despite being a little familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this movie to reach only the basic one: I would like to introduce the characters and their own qualities, introduce a plot and end up destroying the main opponent and possibly a tip for the sequel. And that's exactly what this movie will deliver. However, unlike most other comic films, I felt that he did it with a little class. Risking a more limited audience with strong linguistic and graphic combat scenes, "Blade" presents a very modern, believable and disdainful world whose small nuances effectively provoked a sense of horror - as smaller as it could be - from the viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in The story unless the emotional (ie sappy) aspect is biased. Yes, the movie has countless plotholes, and the absurdly unrealistic situations such as the standard female doctor are surprised enough to endure what no one else has done for several thousand years. But if you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with usage and exciting camera cuts and special effects like what matters? It can run for a long time, but for what it is about to do, "Blade" stands out in a sharp relief among most other films in this genre.
