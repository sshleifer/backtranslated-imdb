I think not! I think if you compare this movie with The Godfather, or maybe a little older movie like Casablanca, or maybe a little newer movie like English Patient. He's not working with a camera or cinematography like these movies, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie or that? I think the reason why this movie is underestimated is that many people always compare it to other great Oscar films (you should never do that), which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor, this film really deserves everyone. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us one of his best performances again. I have forgotten several times in this movie that it's not his son because it was so real! I've never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for actors to play this specific role, but still so beautiful. So in my opinion, Dustin Hoffman is going through a test with flying colors. There are several actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help but think it's great). Meryl Streep, while in a supportive role, is amazing and real, and you just can't help her, but at the same time you drag her to her talent and the way she makes her and her real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great with regard to his age, his tears and his relationship with mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good work to cute little Justin Henry. While I was watching this movie for the third time alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried, but I couldn't. Thank God I was alone! That's probably the purest movie I've ever seen. Another film nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed because I haven't seen any of them, but what I've heard is Apocalypse now great, but when I heard about Norma Rae, I was just thinking of Sally Field. I think that due to the other nominees, this film deserves five Oscars, and that it will continue to touch and persuade other people to cry in the future, just as it has been for the last 28 years. Good work for all the actors and actresses in this film gives us great performances and memories from watching this movie that we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
