One of the greatest films that came out of the 1980s was Dirty Dancing's low budget film with high budget revenue. With the soundtrack you want to get up and dance to, the love story we all want to live (at least if you're a woman), it's a movie you'll want to watch again and again. Music that is what drives the film is positive and flows well with the emotions that are drawn from the viewer. From classic hits "60s like" Love Man "by Otis Redding and" Big Girls Don't Cry "by Frankie Valli to" 80s like "Eric Carmen" Hungry Eyes "and" Overload "by Frank Zappacosta" Dead Dancing "is a mix of fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from a shy teenager to a blooming womanhood, all against the wonderful background of summer romance that we all hope and wish to turn into more." Dirty Dancing " Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most spectacular and enduring gymnasts. And Jennifer Gray shines like Baby, while her transformation in dance portrays her transformation into a state. <br /> <br /> Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time and worth watching. There is no doubt that Ronette's first strike "Be My Baby" in the opening title will not capture your attention and will draw you into the magical world of sensual dance and enchantment.
