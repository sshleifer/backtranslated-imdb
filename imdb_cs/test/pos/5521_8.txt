A man named Jerry comes into the possession of an ancient Aztec doll. However, this scary little character is obsessed with the evil spirit that takes Jerry's body and pushes him to spill blood ... I saw two more horror movies "The Dorm to Dripped Blood" and "The Kindred" by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow to say that "The Power" won't disappoint either. The storyline is slow but there are some effective human goo effects and a little scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by the weapons that come tearing off the mattress's hoot.I like this low budget horror movie and you should also if you are in the 80s horror movie genre.8 of 10.
