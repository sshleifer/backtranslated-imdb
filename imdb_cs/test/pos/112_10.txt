"Water" (2005), the last part of Indian film director Deepa Mehta's Indian trilogy, which was founded in Toronto, was finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the first controversial element "Fire" (1996), followed by a somewhat less controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film "On 99: A Portrait of Louis Tandy Murch" (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada who brought her fame in the East. , her country's birth right, 'Sam & Me' (1991). Recognition internationally came in the way of 'Camilla' (1994), starring Bridget Fonda, along with an actress who in 1990 won Oscar in Best Actress in a starring category at the age of 80, paving the way for middle-aged actresses \ t her portrait of a stubborn old Jewish woman in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), late Jessica Tandy. 'Camilla' was a friendship between two women from two other ends of human life, a friendship from May / December. 'Camilla' was Tandy's last photo; she died the same year. International Glory followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of a controversial 'fire' that spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness of an existing Indian extremist. After exploring the friendship between the two women in 'Camilla' in 'Fire' Mehta went one step further to portray the more intimate relationship between the two lonely neglected women. Set in modern day India, a suburb of the capital New Delhi, shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who joined the strange Hindu sect leads the life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of helpless existence. Younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extramarital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus, as women, Shabana Azmi play older brothers wife and Nandita Das younger wife, they find themselves neglected in their own way. One was forced to lead the life of celibacy, thanks to the quirks of her husband, and the other whose only interaction with her husband was sex and nothing more. The two women who live in the world of law and are the only two outsiders in a family where no one else can confide, fall into their arms. So comes the question of lesbianism. If there was an outside male shoulder that could cry, most likely there would be a chance for them to get into the arms of a man, but no one else to trust is obvious. It does not necessarily mean that all deprived women end up with lesbianism, but in this context it has only happened with regard to both women. All in all, the film is excellent and delves much deeper than just two women who roll in bed. The key focus is not on lesbianism in the film, but the plight of the modern day has neglected Indian women, even in the capital, two female characters just have a sexual relationship. Two years later, Deepa Mehty's second installment was the parent country, which was released in India under the name '1947: Earth', another great director's great movie, this time in Hindi language, unlike "Fire", which was created in English. Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite the many issues recently released by "Water". No doubt it would be as great as the other two.
