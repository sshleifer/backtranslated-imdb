While many pass it on as movie B, it's really a first-rate comedy that is well written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans like The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fianc√© Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well-occupied group of criminals. I read one record of this film, which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, not if he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three Fox movies. This is a very entertaining movie that was created when the imagination was encouraged. So get over black and white prejudices if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really great comedy. It was also the first role played by Red. Take note during the top reference to Orson Welles' War of the Worlds Broadcast.
