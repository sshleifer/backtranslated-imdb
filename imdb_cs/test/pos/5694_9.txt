WARNING: I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen a movie yet to read this comment. This movie was on the shelf in a movie store and since I saw a handful of very horrifying horror movies, I had a really low expectation for this one. I put it in and almost immediately I was sucked in. As I watched, I started deeper and deeper into the story, and soon I looked into total interest. This movie is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about cruising down the river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their ship is attacked by an crocus ready for some food. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this movie would have a lousy visual effect like Lake Placid 2 and a lot more, but when I first saw a crocodile, it looked amazingly real! Don't laugh when I say it, because I'm serious, but this is one of the toughest movies I've ever seen. It really knew how to build nail tension and tension with his intense situation, I think, to think about; Your stranded, on the tree, where to run, nowhere to hide with the hungry predator in the depths of the water. You can't tell me he won't pick you up. I even managed some of my frosts like Adam was captured by a step, and Grace and Lee are confused. This is a very attractive movie. There was possibly 1 or 2 parts where I found myself SLIGHTLY not interested, but other than that, I'd say it's my favorite animal attack movie I've seen.
