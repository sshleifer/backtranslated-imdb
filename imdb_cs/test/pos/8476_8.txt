This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Jamie Foxx Golden Globe). He was born in a poor African American city and was blind at the age of seven, but thanks to his ability to touch and hear it would later lead to fame. By 1960 he had fulfilled his dream, and selling records in millions, and leading charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his falls, including separation from his wife and child because of his affair with a band member, his drug and alcohol, and going to jail for that. Also star Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Dell Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams, Boke Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, CJ Sanders as young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It's a great story with a great singer-song, songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlight. It won an Oscar for Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated for Best Costume, Best Director for Taylor Hackford, Best Cut and Best Film of the Year, it won BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Anthony Asquith Film Music Award for Craig Armstrong and Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Film - Music or Comedy. That was number 99 for 100 years, 100 health. Very good!
