I saw this movie early in the early 90s when I was about 12. I was trying to find what it was and finally I did it! young boy's tombstone and his creepy face! Could someone leave me if I could get a copy of what I'd like to see again. I remember the boy stuck in a cornish tin mine and then befriended a boy. Cant remember that the children were stuck there with the miners, but they must have been.
