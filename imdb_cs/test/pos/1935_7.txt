This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and certainly has an unconventional theme. She makes money by dancing with men in the ballroom. She really doesn't like it, but it's life. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty handsome guy, but she's also chased by a rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after the wedding, it turns out that her "nice guy" is a thief, a womanish weasel, and a rich Cortez turns out to be a damn guy. By the end of the film, Barbara just has enough because every SANE woman would go away from this terrible marriage. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hollywood did almost everything he wanted and some of their movies had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTY AND DANCE is not a vivid example of this morality, it has a theme that would never be allowed after a hard Code of Conduct was created and enforced in 1934. In some ways, the Codex was great - after all, parents didn't have to worry about what their children saw in movies (such as nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tended to disinfect some movies too much - and there is no way that this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to celebrate divorce - serious no-no 1934 and then. It's really a shame, because I don't think TEN CENTS AND DANCE was even discussing it - especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a thief lured. Even so, the film ended with her divorced and the marriage of a man who himself was twice divorced simply could not be. Overall, the film is interesting and provocative. In addition, it was well-paced and suited to its relatively short running time. Give this a look. FYI - Unfortunately Ricardo Cortez wasn't Hispanic, but he changed his name because of possible prejudices because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today everything is forgotten.
