This is a movie that should be seen and considered a work of art. This is the carefree work of the love of the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, who is truly a artistic element. The film jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works of Mishima to him. All this without being a little confused. The only thing that gets me is that the whole movie, with the exception of spokespersons, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves a listener but will not win. The criterion, if you read it, is a movie that should be released under your print with as many add-ons as possible. This film truley deserves more. 10/10
