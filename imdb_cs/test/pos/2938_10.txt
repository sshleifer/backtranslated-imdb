It is as if reality has shown that "American Idol" is not enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell shoot sharp spines of barbed razors for contestants trying to push through the music world - the spines that many times reduce tears' excellent singers. After what was considered "bad performance", now "America's Next Top Model" has over the past three years attacked breast tube with its own version of "Looking for the next big thing" in the business that evaluates the superficiality, the concept of beauty, and the body of dysmorphia . The concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also a judge on the show, gathers about fifteen contestants from all walks of life and is subjected to innumerable "challenges" in which he has to prove his "talent" in front of the camera and submit to not only now leaving Janice Dickinson (self-nicknamed "American's Supermodel"), but so did Cathy Jay Manuela and Nora Marina who can focus on one girl in one place and blithely ri p her pieces as if it were bad morning coffee. As in many other reality-based shows, every week a competitor is elected and has to pack his bags and leave immediately (a thing that Tyra reminds every step). Of course, there are tensions among several type A women who associate with women, female ties, tears, dramatic fluctuations in music at key moments, and some truly breathtaking images that transform former ordinary, pretty girls into unattainable goddesses. I have to admit that the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's a state of mind in which I am, but I was still wondering where the vomitorium is in cases where thin girls would have to throw themselves to cut and look like judges and photographers and many false designers would feel right . for the moment. Even so, despite my previous paragraph, perhaps because I was always interested in the fashion world and always loved watching stunning women who became even more secular with makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they are with the harder photos. It's as if they were competing with "Fear Factor". Shots that look like re-enactments of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shoot where models have to be underwater or in near-impossible situations, what's next: posing while tying on train tracks like the approaching Amtrak yells at them 70 miles an hour? Or to shoot where they are underwater, strapped, trying to break free in record time while looking smashing in chiffon and never forget they are smiling at pearl whites in the camera? How about the "Pit and Pendulum" version of the photo shoot? In one thing, the show must be given some kudos, and it's the way it is similar to "American Idol". With that I may justify the harshness of both exhibitions and its abrasive judges - and basically goes against my starting point. "The next American top model" is a show that is a widespread audition, such as "American Idol", and in it girls get the kind of test treatment they get in the real world, where potential designers and photographers will be as monstrously fickle as they can be, crushing them into pieces in a drop of a hat if they can't sell as they would expect them, and where someone asks him to leave her, another will replace her with the necessary requirements. Which makes it a miracle that every girl wants to get into such difficult media, but that's what dreams do. Going to your fifth season was a big disappointment with Janice Dickinson's departure; during her run, she was a very hard barometer of how girls should walk, talk, emotion, express themselves and eventually present themselves as the product they sell. With the cool addition of Twiggy, I wonder where it goes - Twiggy just can't replace Dickinson's above-average temperament. So with the absence of Janice, the show has lost some of its edge and may have even signaled its slow demise, but in the meantime it is still a catchy pleasure to watch, thoughtless fun at weeknights, if at all for the wonderful visuals. If at all, it's a show that has launched Adrienne Curry into focus. Curry made a name for himself because of the facts that have less to do with modeling as well as her theatric love-affair with one child actor Christopher Knight in their own soap opera reality.
