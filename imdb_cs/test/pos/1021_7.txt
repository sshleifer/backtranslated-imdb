Pleasant film, no doubt and very evocative of both his era and the very special stage of every boy's "passage ceremony". But I have to say that when I read very positive comments, I was a little disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the strangest humiliation in the history of school games. The idea that quack quack will ever be chosen to play not only one of the three star turns, but also filanderra, is undisputed. And without it, over. The sub-parcels carried no relationship that I saw on the main plot - all of which could be removed in full without affecting the main story in any way - which is certainly a major mistake. When all your subplanes look like pads, you know that the central idea extends beyond its borders. However, it is a harmless movie with his heart in the right place, there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that all the participants felt deflated on the last 'cut'! The good feeling penetrates the film. And that must count something. Defective really good movie. 7 out of 10.
