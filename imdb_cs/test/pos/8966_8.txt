Charlie Wilson (Twice Oscar-winner: Tom Hanks) is a carefree Congressman ... Who loves a party, enjoys a woman and especially drinks his booze. When Charlie's old friend and former girlfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar-winner: Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, which this country certainly needs help. Charlie is shocked by what he has seen, especially from all ages, is killed or wounded from this war with the Russians. He decided to help people and rebels fight the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and one CIA renegade agent named Gust Avrakotos (Oscar-winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the greatest covert operation in history. Oscar-Winner Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Henry) has made a vivid, entertaining, sharp satirical war comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in Oscar and Amy Adams as Charlie's loyal assistant are very good at their roles. Despite the excellent assumption of true life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never closes fire and it's not as frantic as you liked it. Director Nichols and screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (A Pair of Good Men) keeps things moving and characters are very popular. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a sharp Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) and good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The only special DVD features are behind the scenes that appear with cast and crew and real life with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been really great, but it's not like that. But this movie is smart enough to please those who have enjoyed well written or well-played adult comedies. (*** 1/2 of *****).
