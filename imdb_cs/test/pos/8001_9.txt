Batman Returns is a really dark movie that shows that Caped Crusader fights the penguin and sexy Catwoman (I'll get to them later). Michael Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne and shows he's a good actor. Tim BURTON directed this image well and the location of the film is impressive. Demons: Danny deVito is menacing like a penguin. A cruel but disturbed man who had a really hard childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the picture. It's the best Catwoman ever! Threatens and is very sexy. There is a scene where Batman kisses a cat's path that only warms the film up. The action scenes are also good and the end is a dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending to Batman. Tim Burton shows that he can handle Batman's film really well (he has already done it with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker character. Just like him.
