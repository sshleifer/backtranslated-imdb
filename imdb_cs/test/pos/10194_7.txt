This film is an evolutionary work - from Terminator to Robocop. Stan Winston made SPFX! In this movie, a scientist working in a sinister robotic society with a really scary boss (they're always) gets them killed in a terrible lab blast and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body. The rest of this film continues with a romantic angle like this Cyborg / Man regains consciousness and causes confusion when trying to communicate with his wife, the beautiful (then in 1986) Terri Austin. (He tries to reconnect with his old life, as in the RoboCop scene) <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is about smashing things while trying to defeat the evil that its evil boss has recovered for some sick people. -defined "turn people into a cyborg project". This film pays tribute to previous films such as STOOD STILL DAY - - how the cyborg is released as the giant robot Gort. Except for "Frankenstein Suite" designed by Stan Winston, the values ​​of this movie are typically Canadian: SLEAZY! ! Pam Grier plays as a hired killer-commando in this film, a cheap role for those who have done so much during the 1980s. As for the Sci-Fi Horror B movie, from 4 stars, this film ranks <3
