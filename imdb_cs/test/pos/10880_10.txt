This is my favorite game for the Nintendo 64 platform. I played many different first person shooters and I never really liked them, but this game has something I can't give a finger on it's a great amount of fun. Maybe it's an extraordinary detail in the game. Maybe it's a smooth movement of characters. Maybe it's gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the great character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never gets lost no matter how many times I've played it.
