I like the phrase "British post war suburban paranoia" used by one of the reviewers. It describes so well what kind of John Mills films excelled ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) among "big" paintings ("Scott of Antartic" (1948) and "War" and Peace "(1956). <br /> <br /> This distinctly" Eric Ambler "plot style had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend, Charles, (invisible) to meet visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport The horrific "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his counseling room at the time and offers him a lift, but while he watched the actress, Windsor tells him he's in his car Howard is fired on his date and thinks he doesn't know it anymore. <br /> <br /> Next night he finds his body when he comes home from work, plus he finds out that his friend Charles couldn't ring, he is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist, Mrs. Ambler (Rene Ray), who was given to him by Doctor G George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) tells of his recurring dream of finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. It's a nightmare that becomes real with Howard, but of course, when Detlander Dane (Roland Culver) denies her conversations, she denies all her conversation knowledge - the candlestick is later found in Howard's Daimler's shoe. When Howard is low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He says he's a "friend" - he has a picture of Windsor he wants to trade with a box of matches that Frieda gave to Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles rings and while Howard is on the phone, an unknown attacker knocks him down and steals the matches !!! Who can believe - who has nothing to hide !!! This is the top thriller - not entirely in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
