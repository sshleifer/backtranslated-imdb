Even though I am a film score of 7, I should also point out that it is both interesting historically (like Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and lesser known) and a pretty exciting feature for their day. The story is mysterious to Western, because all the trouble with the Indians is starting out for a strange reason I've ever seen! Indians decide to have a giant dog feast (no, they are not feeding dogs, but feeding on dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, they are not pooches left! So they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White Settlement, and this actually touches the whole war !!!! Not only is it stupid, but it seems to play on viewers' prejudices. I don't know if American Indians actually ate a dog, but that sounds like a kind of stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this through dogs! The film has several excellent battle scenes and exciting moments - for example, when Mrs. Marsh crosses the battlefield to save the baby! Exciting things! But, STRANGE too!
