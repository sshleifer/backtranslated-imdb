A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is amazing in this movie. Just watch his crazy writhing and scream, and the destructive rage near the end of the movie is enough for someone to think twice about how heroin is trying; maybe they should show it to the kids in the medical class instead of the mindless drive we're forced to endure year after year. It's the story of a man who just tries to create a new, clean life for himself after being in jail, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his card handling in illegal gambling who are torn down, drawn by the evil of human nature into slime. It is used by his employers, drug dealers and even his mysterious, crafty but stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Although you don't like the film itself, it's worth seeing just for the soundtrack. It's all hard, swinging jazz with big drum and brass sections. This, with his groovy but slightly sinister sound, helps set the mood, along with a smile, serpentine drugs and card dealers who always seem to float like vultures around Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone - especially if you like film noir, zoot suits, fedoras or jazz.
