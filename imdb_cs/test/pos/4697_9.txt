Fantastic series, one of my favorite favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is there with them). they dress like foresters. Everything about this series breathes with realism, artistic license or not. It depicts the image of Europe only slightly out of reach of paganism, because most villagers still have their local deities, and Satan worships nuns and magicians, witches and sorcerers who cast spells. But what's at the forefront is that it's a series of time. Rather than the 1950s version, which was lamenting the centralized government and the persecution of McCarthy, this series is deeply anchored in the 1980s. Robin's protector is a nature worshiper called Hern The Hunter, who often appears on the head of a deer and is a personification (like this Robin) of the Green Man, an alternative version of Osiris (Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - It's interesting to note that there is no Robin in these series) In the Hood, the person, but the concept when the old one is killed, is called telepathically by Hern - one can die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, the resurrection concept. The music and score are really great and the Irish band Clannad performs. When I looked at it, I couldn't help but think about how authentic medieval folk music would be Anglo-Saxon. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is beautifully shot in the lush forests of Wales that pass The New Forrest. The only downside is that in the early episodes of both actors they have to overcome their own skepticism and make sure it's really serious work. Then they get into it and acting is great! Michael Praed first Robin (second son of Sean Connery, Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redhead Marion, Phil Rose as a clumsy and truly kind Tuck, Ray Winstone as a volatile and lovelorn Scarlet. Clive Mantle as the giant shepard Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as little John's bumpkin friend and shepard fellow, and Mark Ryan as ex-Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all give great performances. Also good are Bad Guys, Nicholas Grace as a bug-eyed, shocking sheriff from Nottingham, and his aristocratic, wandering sidekick (and Robin's half-brother, as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Fashion designer Richard O'Brien is also really cool, like the evil Lord Owen of Clun's (Olliver Cotton) magician Gulnar (appears at the end of the first series and later in the second). The tenth barn in Bradford, on Avon, stood for the sheriff's castle.
