This movie was definitely written with FF VII fans just in mind. I'm someone who never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a fan of the series. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as the "Ghosts inside", if not better, but from the point of view of the story, I was quite lost. One of the main weaknesses that emerged from me was the scene where "all" of the dying children of geostigm were brought to "heal" the three Jenovites. All there were about 15 children ... Hmmmm ... I thought Geostigma was a pandemic disease disease ... I understand why they did it this way (time, budget, CPU), but it seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the cowards needed to gather all those who had Jen's cells so that Jenova could reincarnate. The subtitle version we had (some fan sub from the internet) was quite a straightforward translation, so it probably added to my confusion. hours at FF VII wiki reading about main characters and conspiracies. Once I read the Advent children 's wiki, it was much more meaningful. If you are a video game or a Sci-Fi fan this movie is a pretty good movie, but as a previous review said, it comes as a 90 minute battle scene. You will never know any of the characters and the story seems to jump from scene to scene without much explanation, although some explanation might be required. Thank goodness for Wikipedia.
