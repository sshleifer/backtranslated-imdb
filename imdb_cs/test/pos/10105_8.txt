Last night I saw "The Story of Two Sisters" and I really enjoyed it. I was a big fan of Asian horror movies recently and I think it's a strong entry from South Korea. There are not many jumps to you, as is the case with the usual American horror movie, but the director retains very well off-kilter and premonition moods, especially in the unpleasant interactions. Most fears are more conceptual and play on something that is "under the bed" fear of when they were a child, but in this case it's a wardrobe and sink. I also liked the director's ability to capture how dilapidated this household is through scenes like the first dinner the characters have together. It is also good when it reveals people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as a stepmother who wipes her makeup in the mirror or sits in front of a flickering television. I think this film is mainly a study of guilt and the consequences of life, with the guilt hanging over you. ) I watched the story quite well, but I started to get confused during the bag. But I think the flashback at the end certainly tied everything together. The film is very similar to "The Machinist" in the way two of the common guilt ultimately lead to mental disorders and delusions. Here's my interpretation of the movie. Su-Yeon, which we see after the girls believe they will return to the house, is either the illusion of Su-Mi or the true spirit of Su-Yeon, with whom he sees only Su-Mi. The initial stepmother we see is, in my opinion, a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the movie when she is wearing gray trousers. I believe he's a real stepmother with whom my father talks on the phone in the first part of the movie, and she won't appear until she picks up her and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point imagined Su-Mi (maybe part of her split personality?) This explains the bizarre sequence of the party when her stepmother's brother looks at her as if she is crazy and she doesn't remember anything she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi who acted as her stepmother of her split personality. The film shows that later in the bag pulling the scene and scenes such as stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror, which is revealed later actually being Su-Mi wiping her makeup in the mirror. I think the house spirits aren't completely introduced to Su-Mi, and they're either Su-Yeon or mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed that Su-Yeon wore a green dress and had hair in his hair when she died. These are the green gowns they'd shown before the ghost who sat at the dinner table while the stepmother looked under the sink. It is also the hairpin Su-Yeon had in his memory of the back that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. The real stepmother, in the end, is punished with the spirit of Su-Yeon, who comes to the scene a bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene binds it all together in terms of how both stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi inadvertently played a supporting role. I wonder if "mother" that Su-Yeon sees as she goes up to her room to cry in memory is a ghost. Perhaps at that moment the mother had already killed herself in the closet. This is ambiguous. Other things that are suggested in the film but are not clearly explained are that the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse who might have taken care of her mother and somehow could be they also contributed to her death. It is not clear when her relationship with her father started and whether it caused her mother to kill herself. It also suggested that the mother also had mental problems requiring a sister. The stepmother warns of this when she says Su-Mi, you're starting to take your mother. I don't think she just meant it physically. Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is also a proposal for incest because the father sleeps with her. That's why Su-Mi is spreading and shouting "Don't touch me" every time a father gets to her in later scenes? Is it the "dirty thing you did" that he mentions in a later conversation with his father? This film is interesting with its capacity for various interpretations. However, several scenes were somehow derived, for example a woman in black crawled on a scene that reminded me of the terrifying moves of Kayako in Ju-On / The Grudge. Also, the last scene where her stepmother finally gets just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. In addition, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "Sixth Meaning" or "Others". <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed it overall and it will be interesting to see how it turned out to be a Hollywood remake (which is already in production). I have to be honest, I liked "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that a remake can't be good either. One remake I'm really excited about is "Dark Water", which will be released this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both movies are on my list.
