Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert dwelling cult who is trying to resurrect one of his people just to have a heart attack! He ends up dying on the operating table, and due to revenge, his ghost takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then goes on to hack and mow before her sister sisters learn what he needs to do. To cast out the demon. Although I know of directors' filmography, to know that he consists of a complete Schlock in the first place, "Sister Sherri" isn't really that bad. Sure, it is clear that these were very cheap things, but all that I found unreal was visual effects. The game is not as bad as one would expect, either. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions available on DVD. A much more sexually oriented version with rich amounts of T&A is the original cut, with such cheerfully silly vignettes as the victim and her love interest that shares their "weirdest sex" moments, including one that includes fellatio during a college lecture! Br /> <br /> The movie would then be re-cut for a theatrical version with horror elements emphasized more strongly. Some scenes are dropped with new additions (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of this film is the foundry scene and it works pretty well. This film section is generally more interesting; I would recommend that the viewer review them and compare them. Both versions hit their turn in the last third and enjoyed the amazing scenic theft of Bill Roy as a crazy Reanhauer. whimsical climax in the cemetery (though actually filmed in Adamson's backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as a cute nurse who is attracted to a football player turned patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden) who has lost his eyes in a car crash and who, by the way, is the key to solving the story with his voodoo ritual knowledge. The film also makes fun use of music from the personal collection of composer Harry Lubins, including songs for such TV series as 'One Step Beyond' and 'The Outer Limits'. "Sister Sherri" more replacement titles (including "Beyond Life" and "Terror Hospital") than any other Adamson movie) is actually quite a fun low-budget tariff. I ended up looking at it well. <br/> 7/10
