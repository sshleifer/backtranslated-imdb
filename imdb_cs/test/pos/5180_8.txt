This is a quiet movie. It's a simple story about a writer who can't write his story to return to his hometown to get started, but instead engages in a friendship with a strange elderly man whose outward-looking life is perhaps the writer's inner state - it's a museum unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or any major movements on the property. It's a film about inner changes. Major people who are trapped in their lives and do not develop much, help each other transform, stop dreaming and achieve something, or at least get a change and give their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction. On the film side, I think of only one weakness that could also be considered an element - we don't get many description characters or inner world views. It is a very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their real feelings, which are rather hidden, but you can still see them, and that is what makes your own mind work, tries to come to them, understand the impressions created These people are not under them - actors definitely hold some inner states of their own characters. It is close to real life, when you usually never know anyone so well that you can fully understand it, and it turns us into our own feelings and choices. What is most important to me is that this simple, almost flat story lets you think about your own life, your own dreams and achievements, is somehow, or we are in the routine and enjoyment, letting we are 100% or just dreaming, we could do more and move somewhere where we would rather be just feeding ourselves and other stories like "I'll do it one day" - I don't move one finger to make it happen , or "Am I cool where am I" because it is easier to go by habit than to actually change? At the very least, this is the impression he left me, and that was very topical to me, which contributes to my recognition of this far from the famous film. Definitely recommend to anyone who likes heart movies, but those who need action and action should stay on.
