This was what was porn, that's a real classic. It's an x-musical based on a real book! There is a real plot on it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs to an exclusive short list of classic movies about real pornography, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic movies" these days is that it's all about "pornographic" and not "movie". Alice in Wonderland certainly has a graphic representation of sex, but in fact she tells the story at once. Not one of the typical "Oh, sir police man, don't write me a ticket" land, it takes the next step and makes it a musical! Wonderful! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, it's one of the best.
