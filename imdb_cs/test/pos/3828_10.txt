I thought I'd add more observations here. While there are several visual substitutes, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; at the end, a strange, physically gentle, moment. When the Enterprise, in an emergency warp speed, tries to overtake a possibly deadly Romulan Plasma Ball, Janice, who may be afraid that their life is nearing a dramatic end, is looking for comfort by placing their head on Jim's sympathetic arm as they watch their approaching instrument the impending doom on the main viewer. I thought it was sweet (and Janice, of course, is beautiful!). (Goof: - Several times while allegedly shooting phasors, the film shows the launch of photon torpedoes)
