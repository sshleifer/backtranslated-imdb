This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always imagined it as John Huston's props. <br /> <br /> I had to see it at least 20 times and I never cared. Mood, screenplay, singing, dinner, it's like inviting to someone's home and watching events and being unable to participate, even if you want to ... It's a rare treasure, this movie and I can't write enough praise for it. It's incredibly well occupied, with quite a few Abbey Theater faces and also a wonderful tenor voice by Frank Patterson. Lady Gregory's poem, recited in the film, is one of the most moving ever written. Anjelica is a scene of walking up the stairs while she listens to the song's one of the best performances everyone has seen on the movie. I cry every time I see it ... for all the right reasons. We all had lost love at an early age and wept for our young hopeful self. Donal McCann acted in too small a number of movies to enjoy, just liked the theatrical work and sticked to it, and it's our loss that we don't have more of his movie appearances as it does does with this delicate role. depicting deep love for your wife who will never be rewarded and he tells such inner sadness when he knows it. <br /> <br /> If you want your actions to deal with film and action, avoid it, there's really no beginning, middle or ending just a lens on characters for a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little nuances and shading personalities portrayed so beautifully. Bravo to all who participated in this production. 10 of 10.
