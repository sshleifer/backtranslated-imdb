Passion in the desert is an example of a spatial grander. It is a visual story illuminated by spectacular cinema. Passion was filmed locally in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustine, a Napoleean soldier, is the companion writer and artist of Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission that documents, measures, draws and draws the city's cultural monuments. Egypt: its dunes, huge ruins and mysterious people. But can you really "document" majestic sands, broken buildings, and wild bedouins? Can you truly capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? Jean and Augustine disappeared in a charming, glittering, golden desert whose vastness overwhelmed their senses. "You can't get lost in Egypt! There's an Nile and there's a sea!" says dehydrated Augustine and soon finds an ancient, winding cave that leads to the palace ruins. Delirious and near-deceptive, he tries to rest; the bewildered sound troubles him; his eyes, body, and emotions become hypnotically locked in time when they encounter a sensual, sensual experience .... The wild, elegant female leopard stares at him and their love relationship begins. ... <br /> <br /> A courageous love relationship, a brave film.
