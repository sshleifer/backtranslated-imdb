This is a really good movie with amazing humor. Jim Verney, as we know, was very good with facial expressions and shows a lot of it in this movie. This is definitely the best of Ernest movies. I would definitely recommend every Ernest fan there. in movies and I'm sure everyone will have this movie. In the movie, (Ernest) plays 2 roles, a bad guy and a good guy and plays them pretty well. I really like the exaggeration of the type of humor where things seem impossible, such as naked cannon movies, and there's plenty in this movie. I bought this movie right after I saw it. Good direction, good script, for rent.
