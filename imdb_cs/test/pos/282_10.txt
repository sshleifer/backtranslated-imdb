Comedians Secret Agents have made a comeback in recent years, with Mike Myers' Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's' Johnny English ', and more recently Steve Carell's big-screen version of '60's Show' Get Smart! '. As early as 1974, David Jason wore a shoulder case and carried a case full of "Classified" documents. 'Top Secret Life of Edgar Briggs' was his first major role in sitcom, after years of supporting the actor in such shows as' Six Terms with Barker', 'Medical' Series, and 'Hark at Barkera '. Humphrey Barclay found him working in Bournemouth Pier and was impressed enough to accompany him alongside Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy series "Don't Edit Your File!". "TTSLOEB" cast Jason as "Edgar Briggs", a well-known but incompetent secret intelligence agent. While John Steed wore a bowler hat, Briggs had trilby. While Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen, Briggs owned a tube. Objects fell in his hand. He read Confidential Documents in Bed While His Wife (Barbara Angell) Watched a Woman's Own (On the other hand, it would be the other way around). Watching a few Russian agents at the heliport, he accidentally turned on Tannoy at the airport and sent out his plans to capture them! When he hid in a train and photographed a meeting between S.I.S. the man and his enemy-contact, moved with him aboard and took him directly to Brighton! When he tried to organize the shipwreck of a Russian scientist, he took a "short cut" to avoid pursuers, only to be hopelessly lost in the parking lot. Just like "Inspector Clouseau," it seemed that he would always come to the top at the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues. As already mentioned, he was married. His wife Jennifer understood what she was doing. Though they had one line that resulted in him screaming at him from the high-rise window: "Secret Service, Secret Service!" You never stop thinking about the secret service! ”. He shouted back, "Think of the neighbors! They shouldn't have known I was in the secret service! ”. Briggs was part of a team of Coronation Street agents. villain Mark Eden (he was psychotic Alan Bradley) as 'Spencer', Michael Stainton as 'Buxton', and 'Doctor At Sea' Elisabeth Counsel as beautiful 'Cathy Strong'. They answered 'The Commander', played by late Noel Coleman. The commander was kidnapped in one episode, Briggs temporarily in charge of S.I.S. - which naturally scared everyone. This cheerful show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who wrote for 'Doctor'. Rather than a spoof Bond, it was more post-up of serious spy shows such as 'Callan' (though it had a Bond-style tune theme). Furtive meetings in underground parking lots, code-breaking, stolen missile plans, such things. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role, made a lot of his own stunts, such as Briggs, who fell off the ladder while decorating his apartment, and fell down the hill into a trash can and reminded of those found in 'Pink Panther' movies. <br /> <br /> 'Briggs' had all the folders to be hit-hit. Unfortunately, it was not connected to the network. In the London area, she was postponed to 7.25 am on Sundays where it was ripped out by B.B.C's "brothers" soap drama. It was then moved to Friday at 7 P.M. Because I.T.V. wanted to showcase his latest American import - "Planet of the Apes". Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate became Jason's next major show: 1976 'Lucky Feller'. It was not until 1977 and 'sharp breath reception' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this series on Youtube. Unfortunately, this is all you can see. Jason won't let his early star performances be repeated or released on D.V.D. Great shame. But at this point, Edgar Briggs's life will have to remain top secret. CODA: I recently saw several episodes and I am glad that it has done incredibly well.
