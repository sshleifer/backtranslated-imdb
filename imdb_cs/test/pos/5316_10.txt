My God, Ryan Gosling has done a lot of deep characters in his career, it's one of his amazing acting works. For me, it is a very deep film, it needs a lot of concentration, not because it is difficult to watch, just because you understand it when you put shoes on in this boy, even though he has everything and has a famous father who is a writer, deeper the mind, you do not understand why it kills the poor child until you have really heard what it has to say and you start thinking, at least to me, that many things that it says are true. A simple boy, sweet, very gentle, in a way that is normal, like any teen, but inside him, because he starts to look at the world in a different way, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie for those who like deep drama.
