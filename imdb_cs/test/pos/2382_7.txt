good job.that thats how I would describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure. This is so far the best of Scooby's animated movies I've seen. and Shaggy and the gang, of course) plus, the movie was a real blast.i has a lot of fun to watch. I also liked the great Scottish music.it was very catchy and infectious. Naturally, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it's still fun to get to this point. animation is also pretty good for this movie. For me, Scooby-Doo and Loch Ness Monster is 7/10
