Well, of course, critics hated him. This is not a movie that has been critically acclaimed. But the fact is, it's really very good. Certainly, if you don't like Chris Farley's physical comedy, or David Spade's extremely dry joke, you won't like it. But for the rest of us, the film has a lot of fun, and for that comes a quote, sequence, and the plot is not half as stupid as that "black sheep." Parts that aren't meant to be funny are actually done well, not what you would expect from this ilk movie, and acting is really pretty good. "Tommy Boy" is without the question of Chris Farley's best film. I give him A and I suggest you give it.
