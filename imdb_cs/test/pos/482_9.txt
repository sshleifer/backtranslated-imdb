There are times when I'm convinced Mikado is Sullivan's best and Gilbert's opera at all, but that's only until I listen to Iolanthe. Whatever the case, Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed from Savoy operas. (Yes, I gave the composer first. Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, Boito and Verdi, or What-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppe, or Balfe: Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) that he had first given his name, it is time to relax a stupid training. <br /> <br /> Anyway Mikado is a compliment to the S&G operetta has a few Sullivan's most interesting numbers combined with some of Gilbert's smartest lyrics, has an interesting book and exhilarating dialogue, has a brilliant degree of insanity and leaves the door wide open for sophisticated and moody costumes Br /> <br /> This particular production, shot in a live performance in 1990, transforms its imagination in remarkable simplicity, which is located in the British seaside resort towards the end of the Art Nouveau period, resulting in costume and setting in a charming blend even white, gray and black, highlighted by occasional pieces of red (and less frequent use of yellow and green). It takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, if the congregation tells you they are gentlemen from Japan, you would be right to say, "Oh, Lord, Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It's very pleasing that this fine production is now on DVD. However, one objection: printing seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so the expected sharpness of the image is softened and still so gently blurred. Unfortunately, the tendency to superimpose images is unpleasant. Why do people who do really spiffy production want to do it with artsy-fartsy stuff of this kind? But it's the performance that counts the most. We can skip the overture because even if there is one, Sullivan never writes it. (True, it may be that he did not write anything for any of Savoys. But Overture Mikada neither dates from Sullivan's life and was compiled by observing the techniques used in others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it is first-class and supremely funny. Ko-Ko is here the guessable Eric Idle who gives it. There is a tradition of bringing a big name to the role. Years ago it was American television production, in which Ko-Ko played Groucho Marx with mixed results. The inactivity performance is wonderfully unpredictable ... it does "Take Out of Prison" with the help of a tennis racket. His "I have a small list" is done as a speech on the microphone - of course it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much more fun than the usual running of such things, and its delivery is positively hysterical. So it goes on. <br /> <br /> It's important to have a good Katishu in this operetta; It's just no fun unless you're in style. This Mikado has a fairy-tale Katishu in Felicity Palmer, almost as a big name as inaction. He says with the best of them in a wonderful rich contrast ... amazing, especially for soprano. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt, apparently accompanying.) Nanki-Poo plays Bonaventura Bottone. I'm having trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish plump shortness - but the voice is an undeniably solid, rich vocal palette supplement. During the "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the choir reacts reluctantly to mention "his nancy on his knees" is a nice touch - don't forget Mikado's flirting decree. Whatever it is, Bottone is a great singer and if his appearance on Nanki-Poo doesn't create the best face, his performance does. Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are reasonably nice and stupid. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his personality as something blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is amazing as a stuffed shirt out of the water ... a role she later made death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty robbers who were forced to care for the brothers kids - something like that). Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody amazing, with an absolutely unquestionable voice to his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend you get it as your only Mikado. Also get good traditional production so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. As already mentioned, I will look at this twice when viewing traditional bits once. Overall, it's an amazing offer, vocal and visual pleasure, with superb play. It's a DVD to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and all. Watch out for bellhops with inscriptions.
