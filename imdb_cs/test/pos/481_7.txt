If you want to see the great performance of Mikada, playing to perfection with professional timing and shock, don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in the 1930s the English Men's Private Club Company, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and good intro on Gilbert and Sullivan, but after this, hurry and rent a Canadian version of Stratford. You'll see the difference between good and big. No one has better G&S than Brian McDonald and Stratford.
