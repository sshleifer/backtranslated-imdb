I recently rented "The China Syndrome" mainly because I read that it was this movie that inspired ABC to make "The Day After". But "Syndrome" is a thriller rather than a drama. The film is quite political, but I strongly agree with its message - nuclear energy, although very effective, is too dangerous for everyday use. The risks are just too high. Hopefully, those who are in charge of real nuclear power are much more responsible and ethical than those in the film. However, given that the real life near the Three Mile disaster has become just a month after the film was released. (In righteousness, this case was probably more incompetent than corruption.) <br /> <br /> "Syndrome" is not only critical to nuclear power, but also to the modern media, much like the "Network", just more serious. As a press journalist myself, I am quite familiar with how people perceive media; but it was a little scary to see that TV news was still selling in the 1970s. When Jane Fonda tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff, it is recommended not to try this change because "research" finds that people prefer a pretty girl who does fluff, not heavy news. But what makes the movie unforgettable is the incredible tension generated in its last third. During this period, the viewer is continually worried about the lives of the protagonists, whether they are in danger of being hired by criminals or a possible breakdown of a nuclear power plant. And the last scene - of course I don't give it - but it keeps you guessing. On the last note, I felt clearly watching a movie that looked more than a TV movie than a real movie. However, it could be more because the rental tape I watched was quite old and unformatted to fit on TV screens as videos and DVDs are today.
