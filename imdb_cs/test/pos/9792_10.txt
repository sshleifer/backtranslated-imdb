I felt I was a boy I loved. I've always been a Joseph Mazzell fan. the child had pure talent both in this film and in Jurassic Park. I was looking for a DVD or VHS to buy in a shop near me I can't find it hope it goes on DVD! so great movie. If anyone knows where to find it, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also, can someone really explain what happened to Bobby. was her real or was he fake and was it an imaginary friend's microphone and his escape? lol i am clueless. My favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and spilled it all over the kitchen with its funny but also sad part as well because what happens to Bobby because of the mess .. I'd love to see the guys face because they played their part pretty good. I think my mother was a great actress, I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or some sorta name like that .. well that's all, please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
