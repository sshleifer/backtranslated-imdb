When I saw most of Coen Brothers' previous movies, I was expecting something else and just outside. Obviously, OBWAT has what it has, but it also has a heart as big as the Mississippi. It is one of the most interesting films that have recently appeared, intelligent, well-formed, clever and brilliantly performing. <br /> <br /> Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of amazing actors. George Clooney totally wins me with his appearance and character Clark Gable-ish. When I saw him in the Three Kings and his Thin Red Line, I'm a fan now. Another comedy, please, George. John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson are excited to help, especially Nelson. If ever "The Simpsons" is made into a movie then he must be natural to play Cletus slack-yokel jaw. I do not think there is a performance that would not achieve an excellent level from the cast. My favorite favorite is Stephen Root as a blind Radio Station Man. Great old-fashioned music, a Yiggy dance by Clooney that I try to learn, and a sense of the era of southern depression depression that is enhanced by sepia-like photos to see the best film so far this century. The only drawback of the movie is that it almost sent me broke the purchase of the soundtrack, DVD and DVD player to play it .... it's good! <br /> <br />
