I was lucky enough to win free tickets to the insidious POD. Let me tell you, I was just thrilled to see it from those insights. The film shook! I liked the fact that JB was in her element. With other films like "Rock School", he makes namby pamby music for kids and families, but this music is of course all his. I took my brother and sister to see me, and we laughed all the time. There are several places where I wonder what the hell she thinks, because some items are a bit disjointed, but for the most part it was great. It didn't look like a low-budget movie, so it's a plus. I was most surprised by Dave Grohl as Satan. This is f-ing hilarious! You honestly wouldn't know that you saw the movie that's on him. I say if you're a rock fan and you're in JB, KG, and / or Tenacious D, check out the movie. Be prepared for LOT links to medication, LOT of four letters and some skulls shredding rocks!
