I just watched it (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some scenes I couldn't stop laughing! Sometimes Dennis's jacket is amazingly fat and just says it's the stupidest thing ... but it's also cool to impress his girlfriend (who is just arrested!) The beach scenery is very calm ... when Robbie Coltrane arrives .. .! It's not the biggest movie he has ever done, but definitely something to think about renting on Saturday night when you don't have anything to do (like me). Maybe you have to hunt for it though - I was lucky as my local video store stores it.
