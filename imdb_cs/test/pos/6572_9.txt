Anand is one of those low budget but well made movies. It's a "cup of coffee" fun, no violence, blood or "jump out of your seat" excitement that most telugu movies have. However, it has some massala's own. Roopa is a stubborn young woman who is not afraid to face any situation, even her offensive mother's resistance to her. She will even break out of the wedding because her fianc√© will not become her. However, her air of trust and independence is enough to make Anand, a wealthy young gentleman living in the city, aspire to be her new husband. His father accidentally kills his parents in a car crash, so why not pay her? But Roopa is not the kind that would fall into enchanting smiles and polite behavior, build it with a lot of situations and continue indecency and pain. It is not until she stands up to her and saves her life that she understands she also loves. But complications arise ???
