"Walking with Dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every respect. Kenneth Branagh tells in a way that really wants to listen to you. The document script really sounds like researchers and writers do their homework, it's so insightful and it gets you hooked and never lets go. Music is also brilliant, very needed. Visual effects and scenery are what makes this document so good. The scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to simply stunning effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but also children. <br /> <br /> This is to be followed in the end. Not only did I love it, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could be with the fact that it would be longer than perfect. Bethany Cox
