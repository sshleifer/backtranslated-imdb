It's like the Czech version of Pearl Harbor. She has the same story, both boys fall in love with the same woman. And he added that the woman is actually married, whose husband has been missing for a year. I don't think the story is too strong. The younger guy is pretty naughty, that's cute. He watched me for emotional music and pleasing scenes behind me. It also has some strong visual peculiarities. Best of all, love stories are seamlessly integrated with the story. I think that if it were in English, it would be so big across states. It's too bad that many people are not open to foreign movies.
