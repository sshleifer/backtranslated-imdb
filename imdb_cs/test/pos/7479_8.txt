Is Thursday an Original Movie? Damn no, but it's a lot of fun! One night I caught it buried on movie channels and it was a nice movie. I was expecting a lot, but what I got was a few interesting scenes (I really liked the first thing I saw in the convenience store), some fun stories as the characters called me and a bit of action thrown into the mix. A few good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkov√°, were good and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who made me another impression on your friends and neighbors and Erin Brokovich). So if you want 90 minutes easy to go fun to go ahead and check out Thursday.
