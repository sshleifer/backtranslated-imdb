I had to add my comment to increase the average on this. Paul Giamatti let it hang and it's a hurry. He would probably say it's easy, but he really does a great job and has something to gain. We had a DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this over and over again and humor is so adult that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I'm running on TV for really funny parts) ). Simple moral message, lots of decent actions and grotesque, "bad" adults doing cracking to get to the edge, minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes is hard to beat the family standard.
