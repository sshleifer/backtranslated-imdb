Before I rented this movie, I wasn't sure, so I made sure that Hilary Swank always performed excellent in her films. He seems to rely on restraint to get the emotional impact he does. And in this movie, I couldn't prove wrong. However, the film also had fantastic performances by all other cast members, both speaking and speaking. I have to choose Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main protagonists - for their outstanding acting skills and portraying real human feelings and failures. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. I must applaud Tom Hooper as a director and Avril Beukes as an editor to keep the multi-layered story smooth, while dialogue and action move in plain language. fashion. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was remarkable and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photo. Why does a movie like this never get an international award. It seems to me that I came across a button with a high rating in all numbers. It wasn't just a movie, it was a real life experience in a country that comes from apartheid. The life of poverty was all around, but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
