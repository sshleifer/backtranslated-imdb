People with gore aversion can find some scenes hard, but The Thing is far from being a horror classic. The fact that extraordinary special effects oppose state-of-the-art daily CGI is just a small part of why this film is rightfully considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in your camera work and editing, superbly written and fiction, one of the best holes, one of the finest endings, tensions and paranoia that have been kept all the time (with countless views), excellent soundtrack and open to many readings and analogies , there just isn't enough superlatives to do film justice. Absolutely necessary viewing.
