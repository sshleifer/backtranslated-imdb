As I said in the previous notes, some programs should be "Light Entertainment". So I'm somewhat frustrated when commentators expect a program that reveals the meaning of life to get out of Cleopatra 2525 and is not expected to offer it. You get a girl who was frozen and is 500 years later brought to life and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not settle in 10 minutes as what happens to other time travel adventures, and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to take all comers. most of us would be. However it is easy to play, stories have a start in the middle and end in a quick time and their are some surprisingly good moments of acting. An episode where Cleopatra's pair is particularly mobile and Jennifer Sky thinks it gives one of the best performances of a dying man long, and being a film and television enthusiast I know what I'm talking about. Finally, to prove my sincerity, I bought all but four episodes and am completely satisfied with the purchase. The only reason I don't have a complete set is that I bought more episodes before I realized there was one complete set of boxes. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio, and Cleopatra 2525 definitely enjoyed it for fun.
