Hmmmm. I'm a little lost here. I know I liked Death Bed, I know I'll spread the Gospel of the Dead Beds to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you read it, I urge you to see the Dead Bed, but I can't really say why. Maybe it's the secret of his spell. <br /> <br /> Fence? Somehow. There's a bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, trunks, and other things that come close to it) by sucking them into their digestive fluid filled mattresses. Among its almost unlimited powers, Bed has the ability to keep the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley trapped behind the image regarding and telling the film's events. Different people then close in Bed's abandoned mansion (Bed's habit of eating anything that was moving, giving this place a disgusting reputation) and laying down to have sex, or to nap, or because they don't feel well and eat, sometimes at first trippy dreams. Finally, we have a final confrontation between Beardsley, Beda's mom (you had to be there) and Bedem. It seems to be quite simple when I said so, not well, except for the Aubrey Beardsley section. But something feels constantly off-kilter, and the story seems to slide sleepily from one scene to another, even if it indulges in cheap laughter or strange gore effects. Imagine that Bunel switched to Bergman, then he got wet in the great tub of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story goes from horror, fairy tale, comedy, existential meditation without breaking a step - an incredible success for a film without a budget for students shot in Detroit. All in all, a stunning little movie that, apparently, no review can ever completely do justice. You see it yourself.
