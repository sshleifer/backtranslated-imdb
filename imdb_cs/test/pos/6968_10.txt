Well, I have to admit, I'm a bit like Peter Liapis and I admit it's not the best ghoulies continuation. Yeah, it had its drawbacks, like NO GHOULIES. But the two Ghouli who came to the ground were really funny, I think they were called Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the movie plot. And even at the end of the film, both Ghoulies indicated that it would be a sequel. I'm still waiting. lol. Peter Liapis repeated his role of Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or tense, but it's definitely funny. I thought I would comment on this movie and say - it's not that bad. It is worth watching, even if there are no Ghoulies in it.
