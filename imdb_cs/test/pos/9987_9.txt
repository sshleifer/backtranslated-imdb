THE BIGGEST PLAY EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an incredibly uplifting, contagious movie that never (indeed) turns into happiness or cumbersome. Yes, it takes a few freedoms, as most Hollywood movies do, but the freedoms are forgiven because they actually add to the film, not downplaying it. In fact, there are plenty of true moments in it. You can really say it's a "Rocky" movie from the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Driven by anyone but Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), It's professionally done and extremely careful! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, dick and class superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a working-class Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 19th century. Ouimet qualifies to play in the 1913 US Open. His competitions include the legendary Harry Vardon (played with a huge class, dignity and fury by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the second cheater in this movie! The film begins in 1870 in Scotland, where ground developers say a young man is building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game that isn't meant for someone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudices as a boy in the early 1900s by Brookline. The stories converge in the 1913 Open. Ironically, even as an adult and multiple chief champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society because of his upbringing. Francis learned a lot about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject, and Vardon is his idol that grew up. Vardon failed to actually meet in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won the Open that year, was on tour when Francis was just 7. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, the entrances in The 1913 Open includes Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (stormy Stephen Marcus) and classless, chest, double champion champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. Redheaded Marnie McPhail is incredibly calm and overwhelming, as Francis' supportive Irish mother and veteran Elias Koteas gives strict, reserved, silent performance to his French dad. In addition, the clever young Josh Flitter (as Francis is pin-10-year-old Eddie) almost unilaterally steals management. <br /> <br /> Paxton throws into many modern details, such as special zoom effects- in shots to show the location of the players table and CGI for plenty of golf shots to make the film exciting and brisk at a pace to avoid the film too much period piece . However, the film still convinces us of a particular time and place. What's interesting is that while Rocky-like all comes out of a real story! So the end is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining movie about golf from the early 19th century ... Wow!
