This movie has it all! He has a good story, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some great gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe The mega successful company 'Callaghan Auto Parts' has to go on the road to stop the company that will continue after Big Tom dies. The trouble is that Tommy knows nothing about break pads and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts Richard's worker (David Spade). From the moment two dorkers hit the road, the movie is so fun. If you like a slapstick with a big story you'll love it because gags keep coming fat and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but the merit of his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
