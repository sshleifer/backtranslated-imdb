Although not the most technically advanced film I've ever seen, it was a fun and enjoyable few hours. The main characters are sweet and really like them, and feel something when Susie Q. has to go, but again she feels good when she returns as Maggie. Lots of stock market dialogue and conspiracy inventiveness, but above all LOTS OF FUN.
