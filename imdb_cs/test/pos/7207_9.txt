For those who don't know, Asterix's books are an extremely successful series of comics about the village of unreal Gauls who resist Caesar's invasion with a magical potion that makes them invulnerable supermen. There have been several animated features (only one of them, the twelve Asterix tasks really capturing the joke and the spirit of the books through the original screen story being) previously perfectly cast by Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu assumed leadership roles in two live actions adaptations that proved colossal successful throughout Europe, but they did not give any impression at all in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The uncontrolled French version is great fun, but unfortunately it is not available in the English subtitles version outside the UK DVD. Although there are still no signs of US theater or DVD release, Miramax Asterix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre is also on this DVD (and played on British TV) and you will never guess what - it's completely new edited (min. 21 minutes) and dubbed into English. Perhaps Harve hadn't prepared it for the Hong Kong movie - after all, he had never seen a foreign film he didn't think could be upgraded with heavy adjustments and shelves for years. While Asterix et Obelix Contre Cesar has been lovingly dubbed into English from Terry Jones' particularly good translation script, but has otherwise remained unchanged, this is not the way of Miramax. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get a book of mixes of slapstick, anachronisms and highbrow classic funny aside on the screen, but plenty of classic links are gone (eg, Grand Raft Medusa gag gaze or Cyrano de Bergerac links from Depardieu), besides everything that seems too French or it could slow down the image, with the result that the first 20 minutes is now a real slogan. A few punchline sequences are missing, Depardieu's part has been trimmed (part of it has been relatively small due to its serious health problems during filming: the US version has been partially digitally redesigned to change the unhealthy facial paleness of the original!), And as usual with dubbing because literal translations into English are not right, the lines are either rushed so much that they are no longer funny, or the dialogue has changed completely (while a few of these changes are funny, as one character dreams of a world in which to move lips in French and hear words in It is not a total disaster, but it is very disappointing about how good the full version is, it would be nice to think that Miramax would make Shaolin Soccer and release both versions, but because both films postponed for two years, paid $ 45 million for them (another classic case of Harvey's notorious reproach for witnesses) ronic buyer: Gee, why would Disney be so p **** d to overcome them) and still have no plans to release that might be too wishful thinking. It's really a shame that such an accessible and entertaining movie will now be available for non-French speakers in such a clumsy bowdlerised version. The hideous Gaul seems to have been able to defeat the Caesar legions, but they don't match the Miramax race.
