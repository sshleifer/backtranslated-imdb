All three of the main characters are hopeless and you are sorry for just one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. That was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and no ditch of no good Harry, no success. Then there is satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a big role as a transvestite and Moving Story Harvey Keitel about his outrage playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino makes half a monologue and Anthony Quinn turns Ernest into a rich man. <br /> <br /> Great moments reappear in the story, but it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn't have a happy ending or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right. This film is strange, but then I am; No wonder I liked it.
