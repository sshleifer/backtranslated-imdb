I have a little hobby to find really cool photos out there that are largely unknown-and then let people know about them This one is on top of my list to get the word out in the summer. This indie movie (and indeed I think indie - not miramax, fox searchlight india) can be easy to overlook in the big maze of celluloid, but if you want something completely different - you have to check it out. Basically I thought it was absolutely great. I should have known from the DVD case, both front and back, that it would be something completely different, but everyone says their things are different than hanging them up. Well, this is really completely different. It's in your face: beautiful and frightening and shameless to tell you to wake up. War, Peace, September 11th, poetry, even the horrifying kind of music video set for an old "patriotic" song and a weird guy in RV. Do I need to say more? Just see it.
