I'm just beginning to explore the beautiful world of Monsieur Ozon. I have seen only 4 movies so far, and the last in the series has struck me that everyone was in fact lonely women and their actions. It is not the only lone female figure in 12, and all of them have a hard impact on their surroundings. This film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is good. Br /> <br /> The homosexual theme is almost a standard part of the background for ozone films, so it does not emphasize accent (even though the character's appearance may be). Pay attention to feelings, not to their objects. Very nice and ephemeral, really like summer romance, and at the same time relaxing for the mind and mind, giving some food to the soul.
