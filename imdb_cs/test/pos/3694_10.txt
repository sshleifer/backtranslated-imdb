You know, people who make comedies often forget that it's really ok to be outrageous. Not this time. Unconditional love has it all. Barry Manilow and the dwarf in the movie with Cathy Bates as a romantic lead ... and it works. Not only does it work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard that I thought I was hurt, but the main characters were so human, so honest and so real. But isn't it where the big comedies come from? Do the characters need real feelings, real emotions and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do it in this movie. Unconditional Love is a movie you shouldn't miss, especially if you need a really good laugh, or are you wondering how to see a psychotic dwarf in a red cloak.
