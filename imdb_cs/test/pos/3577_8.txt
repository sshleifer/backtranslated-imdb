"Bad dreams always come back as unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who, with her step-sister Laura, lives in a large Victorian country house. â€œAnd last night I was in the Limmerid Cemetery. Normally dead are dead, as are usually criminals who are more likely to be closed than victims. "And we're on the first high-class Gothic story of madness, deceit, and villains, based on the great Victorian mystery novel Wilkies Collins." It's a good idea to pay close attention because there are land on the land, but they all focus on a cunning and reckless system that includes what else, money, a lot of money. Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell), are dedicated to each other. Marion is wild and protective; Laura is softer and more romantic. Marion has no own money; Laura inherits wealth when it comes to age. Marion has no prospect of marriage we know of; Laura was promised sometime to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), a completely overly charming aristocrat. They are their uncle's wards, a crazy, condescending, extremely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). Everything seems to be quite routine, but then the young artist Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln) deals with drawing and art appreciation. And when he arrives at the local train station at night, there is no carriage so he walks to the estate. In the dark woods, she encounters a strange woman dressed in white, wandering and talking about things she doesn't understand, who then disappear. Are we concerned? Yes, and so do nurses when they realize that a strange woman looks like Laura. Later, love appears between Walter and Laura? Does bud have a flower? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and leads Laura to marry Sir Percival? Does the drone drone? And slowly, the secrets of relations between Laura, Mary, and the woman in white appear ... we will learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions ... to come to enjoy the style and ways of Sir Percival's close friend Count Fosco (Simon Callow) ... and finally, we realize the depths of corruption, as well as the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian mad asylum, see falls from tall towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and look for revenge that comes in the midst of the roaring flame of a locked church? Well, of course, and it's a great way for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program delivers fine performances and outstanding production values. In order to get Collins' novel 500 plus-page to a television show of less than 120 minutes, good business had to be shortened or shortened, and some of the changes were most likely achieved in the short time available. However, in my opinion, the production of The Woman in White works very well as a moody, romantic, dark TV story. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives command performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever performance that allows us to let us see the spoiled slime beneath the skin, which still has the magic in the village. Ian Richardson as an uncle of young women almost steals the show. It gives such a panic and pungent performance that it almost does not match the story every time it appears. Perhaps the weakest of the major parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster, yet very civilized and charming. Collins described him as being a huge circuit. Callow does a great job, but he misses a little evil for me. At one point Marian tells us: "My sister and I are so in love with gothic novels, sometimes we behave like we are in them." Little did she know what was for herself and Laura.
