In the genre itself, this film has a limited audience and close appeal associated with a subtle undertone that penetrates the entire production. But it is a remarkable cinema that is as timeless as a rare piece of art. The capture of time in Quebec rarely seen in movies, Mon Oncle Antoine's power lies in the depth of his characters and the wealth of settings. Duplessis' Québec, a parish and feudal, is brilliantly occupied as a background that could not be achieved by anyone but the pure lace of Québecois. It would be too easy to resort to stereotypes, clichés and unanimous myopic statements in this story. However, the director decided to skip forced pictures and instead focused on the essence of life in rural Quebec of that time. As a result, this film is exceptional with its authenticity, without being demanding in its presentation. If only more contemporary filmmaking efforts would do, the public would not have to choose amongst the exorbitant Hollywood Pablum that would follow the "Must See". Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. This leaves a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived in - or visited - Quebec. Classics. ********************************************** <br /> <br /> Watching: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reading some comments, it is worth noting that Mon oncle Antoine is NOT - and probably was not MEANT to serve as a standard Hollywood / American cinema for mass market sales . The story of the age story, yes, but much more than simple memories of adolescence in Quebec in the 1940s. Viewers looking for pure entertainment at the expense of complex character development will be very disappointed. Check out the action / adventure / romance / comedy to be entertained. Watch Mon oncle Antoine to be drawn into a rarely visible but totally remarkable company that has been overlooked and ignored for too long. Grapes of anger are hardly a marginal thriller, but the story and characters are what makes this American classic a permanent film. Mon oncle Antoine is in the same genre.
