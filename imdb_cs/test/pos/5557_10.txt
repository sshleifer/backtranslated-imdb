Faqrscape is really one of those shows that have it all, great acting, great casting, great writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... it's all and then some, except home. It seems that this fantastic series has everything but ends. It seems that TPTB thinks it is a series that is a consecutive show of individual sets, where everyone who watches is an ongoing, one epic, love story that has an end that must be seen. If you've never seen Farscape, do a favor and check out the DVD when the October 1 season is released and Season 2 is the best! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up, and then the new season starts in January-March, when most shows are going to hiatis and definitely watch. If everything goes well, we'll get our end!
