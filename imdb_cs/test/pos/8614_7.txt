Catherine Breillat, who was selected during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, this year 2002, is masterfully divided into her autobiographical film, where her main actress, Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson) embodies the admirably film director Intimate Scenes. This is an actor's comedy. Creation? Movie genre? Pornography or Exhibitionism? Sex is a comedy is a post modern film, with its screenplay based on film inside the film. The film is, as an implicit story of a minimalist love scene, built with constant solidarity of forms and spirit, in which Breillat constantly smashes and analyzes taboo. Catherine Breillat uses visual coding and a sense of formulation and carries out her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside the society to be communicated through the heart door. Therefore, Grégoire Colin (Good Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Dream Life of Angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of Actor and Roxanne Mesquida (Fat Girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie of Angels Bay, Manuel Prada), actress, are actors who are bringing up, explaining in the interview. Breillat watches the man before him, even the chaste man. Then Breillat films shame and sexual mutilation, but also great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, nudity of feelings, half of exhibitionism, playing one. The director is finally expected to lead the actors to give their feelings, their body and soul. In this way, facing the problem of the "who I am", the Breillat actors put on inorganic vitality to connect with her ongoing work. But for what is the form of incredible exorcism, for actors, Breillat asks many questions. It takes great suffering at the same time, the actors seem to be looking for this loving transport to be part of the eternity of their work. Breillat is a scientist who is supposed to know how to engage in a dialogue to remove the borders of intimate scenes. Join the make-up, erection prosthesis and syndicates without recalling what pictures and scenes of Jan Sten and Rembrandt can be in the anecdote and day of the characters on the set. While the moral category disappears from the background of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat manages to reveal the loving imitation of actor power in the landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
