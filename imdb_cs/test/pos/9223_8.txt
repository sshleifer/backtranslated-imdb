I first saw this movie when I was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was around the age when the 80s cartoons were big. My mother once recorded it and thought I liked it. I've never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie. When I saw it (on one of the old BETA tapes ...), I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it's badly written, and all that, but it's a children's movie and such things don't matter to kids. I loved the story and especially I liked the songs and all the female characters. Of course, I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Rat and they were repelled, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could totally relate. The story was basic good vs. the evil children enjoy, and there were plenty of happy moments to balance the scary ones. The world is a fantastic place to inspire the imagination of every little child. I am very glad that I had the opportunity to see this movie when I was little. This made a big impact and watched it bring happy memories of childhood. I would recommend to every parent with small children to rent this film. Launches their imagination and provides a lot of fun. You're just a kid once, so don't miss out on this!
