You can read all kinds of links to the world of idiocracies. A futuristic world populated by a pampered, confident spoon that feeds on past-era technologies: this idea has its precedent in HG Wells's "The Time Machine," and among other satires is "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley. At the beginning of the film, the narrator explains the rapid degradation of mankind in five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps from which all futuristic technology has come. Most criticisms of this very entertaining (and humorous) film seem to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic." As if "realism" was sometimes a necessary quality of satire. Is "Brazil" Realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? How is Gulliver's Way? I thought not. "Idiocracies", though perhaps not as if it were the best of the genre, hits the same notes and overall does so successfully. Besides, I didn't consider futuristic technology a problem. It's pretty easy to find out that Mike's judge is satirizing the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces so even total idiots can use it. As in the "brave new world", the film seems to have reached the point of automated self-sufficiency at some point in the past (apparently created by the now defunct "clever people" to calm the ever more stupid population), he could indulge in all the worst, the most selfish stimuli with which they can come, and even more stupid. The film is taking place during the last breath of humanity because everything is beginning to crumble. This may still be "unrealistic", but if so, it is a remarkably well-presented brand of unreality. Of course, stupid people take up most of the time on the screen, but they're just victims - they don't know anything better. Mike Judge will save his real hatred of intelligent people who are dead when the film begins, but which is currently very lively in the 21st century. People like scientists who pursue "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no reason other than the possibility that they will benefit from their snake treatment. People like politicians who let corporations simply buy FDA and FCC. People like media managers and their yuppie stooges who promote stupidity - who allow the destruction of all culture, morals and health to make a fast dollar. After all, who is really to blame, Morlocks or Eloi? Paris Hilton in the world, or great managers and advertisers who have put it on TV and reduced our cultural standards to leave it there? But all this is in "Idiocracies". A line here, a hint there (a cheerful car-witness witness who literally does all the work in the health care system). It is one of the few aspects of the film that unnecessary narrator did not release into the country. It's just for the viewer to pick up or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. It is a pity that so many people will let the film think it's just an excuse to show the backs of farting and people hit in the groin. Not that it wouldn't be fun either, and maybe it's a little panding. But in "idiocation" it just isn't as easy as it seems.
