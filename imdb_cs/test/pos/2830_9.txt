I would suggest that only Valiant is one of the most original and interesting and in some ways strange films Peck has ever done; bold, surprising and one of his most beautiful westerns (- no, of course, not western, but a military chronicle that is sometimes better -). It's a relatively low budget, but oh, very original and striking. It's one of those gifts that ever gets a real buff; movies that no one has ever said exist. You say it sounds interesting or interesting, and exceeds your expectations. Overall, the scenario shows a level of maturity unusual for Westerns? oblique, ULZANA; is it also direct not? senseless tension. Peck looked like a young and hard, somewhat grim and stoic officer; and there are many unexpected touches - like the blonde, kissing and flirting with the one she decided not to marry, perhaps the feeling of her justice and retribution. <br /> <br /> Even the genre, ONLY ??? it is much more than a military story - it is also an action drama, a thrilling film, a commando / action thriller - the most weird combo imaginable; a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to avoid and stop a possible Native attack? - a crazy decision does not take all available soldiers to a place where these natives can stop, but only a few people? - and this plot never takes crap on the route? Interest in people, people and their reasons and actions will never disappoint. An Important Word About Peck; he performs with brios, and although his most famous and most interesting films are mostly in those little trips, I notice Peck's dark and even cool charm. It was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this extraordinary movie.
