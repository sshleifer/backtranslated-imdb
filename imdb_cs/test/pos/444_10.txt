Uncle Frank is the uncle of everyone. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience. The director has done an incredible job of capturing the small and big pieces that made up their lives. Thanks to all who helped create this movie!
