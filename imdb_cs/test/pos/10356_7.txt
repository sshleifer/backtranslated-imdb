The American-made final entry in the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror movies concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the ruler of the fictional country. He dies of cancer, but figured out how to bring him back: put the brain in the body of the donor. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) is built in a very unlikely body: a facial scarred giant servant named Gor (John Bloom). A friend of a friend's ruler tries to fix matters and end the plans of mad doctors. Partners of Samuel M. Sherman (Producer) and Al Adamson (Director) Corral Several Actors I worked with him, including Taylor, Adamson's sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angel Rossitt, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to build on the previous records of "Blood Island", but it can be said that it was done by the state. Although it is not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a lot of fun elements that can contribute to a fun whole movie. The Wicked Dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, somewhat unconvincing make-up work on Bloom, political intrigue subplot, cave full of cobwebs, etc. The story is actually quite coherent, with plots throwing here and there. I think it might have been a little trimmed; drag some scenes. But it has fun moments and end people don't expect. <br /> <br /> Acting is not too bad for this kind of thing. Taylor and Rossitto are fun; The second one seems to have a good enough time in his role. Volante is pretty appealing and Williams is O.K. in a heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all these familiar faces in one of these movies. Absolutely nothing special, but as a cruel B "horror" (I use the word freely, none of this is a scary movie), it certainly does. <br/> 7/10
