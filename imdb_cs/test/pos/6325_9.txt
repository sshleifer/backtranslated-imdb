The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman who washed on the shore, abandoned by Jim walking on the beach lost in dreaming and returning home at night, ending with murder and secret. Yeah, this is an atmospheric small number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to reveal what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of a woman missing 20 seconds after entering her home. Sure, any explanation is a bit fetched. Why, for example, go to the length of a woman's replacement in the middle of a car when she just rubbed her and her companions out would be so easy and left less traces. However, these niggles aside, it is a memorable TRF episode full of invention, although YA AGAIN Jim gets into the frame still suspicious police department. I mean, they have ungrateful so-and-so is sometimes sat and counted how many of theIR files have been resolved by expensive ol 'Jimbo?
