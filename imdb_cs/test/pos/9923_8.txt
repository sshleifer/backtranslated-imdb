'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Screenplay: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (Church, Dreamless, Demons) Photo: Ronnie Taylor (Chorus, No Sleep) Music : Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, 'Goblin') The Story: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is Lady Macbeth, who is a very stylized production of Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's time for dawn comes when a diva star breaks her leg before opening the night when she is hit by a car running away in excitement. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turnaround when the number of bodies begins to rise. It looks like Betty gets her first fan through a stalker who ties her up and her needle tapes to her eyes to witness her horrible murders around her. Story: 3 of 5 Acting: Acting in many of these Italian movies can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes be in the same flick because they usually speak their native language, making the dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. As a result, I usually shortened them in this area. Acting: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Directed by: Giallo maestro Argento re-enters the genre that has helped the pioneer. 'Opera' shows on top of your game with an excellent blend of gore, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This must be one of the best Argento movies. "Opera", beautifully filmed by Taylor, includes stunning and inventive camera work that keeps the film fast and hard and keeps the eye happy. The camera always seems to be about whether it is an amazing shot of a camera going up a spiral staircase or a succession to the end of a bird's eye view of the aforementioned bird circling in the crowd in the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 Audio: The frequent collaborator of Argento Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo efforts) compliments the action on the screen with zeal because his score touches on classic (Verdi) metal. (with a little help from Brian and Roger Ene and Bill Wyman) and lends musical muscle to the bloody cartilage of the screen. The sound design gives you everything you need, from stabbing to shots, screaming fires, and masterfully remastered on Anchor Bay's anchor 6.1 in a wonderful 6.1 for every crunchy and cow. Sound: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical: Adjustments keep the film flowing and amazingly moving. Combined with working with the camera, editing helps to save an unreal dreamy image. The excellent opera house is one of the hellish places and ideal for the horror version of Macbeth. You can't finish an Argento movie without commenting on the kill. Argento sends the characters with pleasure this time with a brilliant sting sequence, wrinkle-wrinkle wrinkles, and film-tipped guns that penetrated the keyhole into the eye and back of the head, sending Argento's former wife Daria Nicolodi to the movie morgue. Invaluable! Technical: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Wrap-up: Almost flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that brings all the visual excitement that Argento fans desire. <br /> <br /> Total: 4 of 5
