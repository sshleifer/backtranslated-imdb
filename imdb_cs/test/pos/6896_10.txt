This movie was very fun with just a little gore. These are two grave thieves who go about business as usual when they find that there is another client they can serve. This will change the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is narrated by the younger of the two, as the business of the priest explains before being sent off. His partner was already beheaded. The priest must get rid of the last confession and take the form of a story. There is some animation thrown into which puts Tales from Crypt feel. In the story, we meet another group of criminals who are afraid, but at one point the younger of the two is offered to work on the execution, so it reassures part of the hostility between the groups. When a woman joins both men, she crosses her boundaries and gets into trouble with the dreaded grave robbers. The story leads to a meeting of two groups that led to the arrest of a man who confesses and a man who has lost his head.
