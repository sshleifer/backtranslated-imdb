This movie has really impressive action scenes. Humor and action are well mixed, although the film's intensity will not be maintained until the end. The last scene is a slight climax in terms of the quality of the action and the amazing explosiveness of the scenes that precede it. Humor does not seem to be as ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hong Kong films, and this film is completely different from most American action comedies of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero who sends invalid orders from incompetent police superiors. The film's dialectic is based on superhuman coldness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, a humiliating police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with various machine guns. Leaving lots of corpses in the wake. Yu Rong-Guang is especially impressive as an ultra cool, ruthless gangster in this Woo-like piece of action where the guys are really dying.
