Dear Readers, 2001: The Space Odyssey is Kubrick at its best ... although I really can't say Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever watched. But it's still a good movie. Strange but good. The film is in three acts, much like a novel ... which is not surprising because the author wrote the script. Anyway, we start with a simple but spectacular opening, and also with Sparach Zarathustra. Then comes the boring sequence without the "Dawn of Man" judgment. Then there is a strange sequence on the Moon, "The Search for Monolith", which played on Strauss' Blue Danube. Eventually things get in order with the spaceship and HAL scenes that spread and kill people. After things die and we have 'Entering a Monolith' sequence that was too long and ultra-odd. Despite 2001: The Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator, or Abyss, but rocks. My compliment to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, Constant DVD Collector
