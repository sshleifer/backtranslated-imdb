For all those people who believe that dialogue is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is smart enough to take you seriously, this film will surprise you. It's not "whodunit" for people who can't follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). Cornell teaches in Southern California, near a tar pit. In four years, he has not published a novel, his wife is divorcing him, drinking a little, and being blessed or cursed by a caustic wit that frees his students. He recommended a friend for the procedure and one clear young student handed him the manuscript as a separate project. Cornell doesn't want to read it, so he gives him "A" and pushes him to the side. He leaned back with a drink in his office and stared out the window as a bright young student walks past a window on a meeting path with a walkway in a meeting with icons. Hal comes to talk and talk, drink more. Cornell realizes he has now read the manuscript. When he goes home, his wife waits with divorce papers. He drinks more. He leaves and goes to the faculty affair just to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, he faints and finds out he has an affair with the student. This, of course, forces him to do something more serious. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm of one of his students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan). He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned, is irreversible and has 24-48 hours of life. He doesn't have much time to figure out who killed him, and at every turn there are partial parcels, motifs, relationships, and surprises, though everything is meaningful at the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are decorated with sarcasm, dry wit and enthusiasm. Let's say this film will give new meaning to the publication "publish or perish". There's no bad performance in this movie. There are repetitive images and symbolism used at cautious intervals. Beware of cracked glass and images distorted by glass. Some of the camera images are revolutionary for 1988 and some of the violent actions are carefully and skillfully choreographed. Music is inconspicuous and appropriate, even though it sometimes makes its own claims, in song lyrics. The visuals in this film are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there is a failure, it is that opening 20 minutes will move a little slower and almost put you to sleep. However, the stimulation increases rapidly, with the exposure amount being different between the individual action segments. There are no explicit sexual encounters, even if there is violence and some bad language. This is a writer's film and will be best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you're already in trouble.
