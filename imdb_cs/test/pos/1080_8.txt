I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2004. Since I work in a winery, I was very eager to see this document and I was not disappointed. According to reports based on more than 500 hours of recording, it is good news that Nossiter will not only release a theatrical cut, but a ten-year-long ten-hour DVD movie (ThinkFilm distributes it) next Christmas. The bad news is it's still a bit clumsy animal. When it was shown in Cannes, it was almost three hours long. It is shortened to half an hour for Toronto, but it still takes 135 minutes. It's okay for me. I love wine and I like to hear about the conflicts that rage in my business. But not everyone wants so much. Nossiter plunges around the world, from Brazil to France to California to Italy to Argentina, talks to winemakers and PR people and consultants and critics about the wine world. The topic that arises is that globalization and the disproportionate influence of Robert Parker's wine criticism bring something similar to wine. Small local manufacturers are either purchased by larger conglomerates (American and local) or are being exerted by market forces to change their wines to suit Mr. Parker's floor that dictates the taste of most Americans (and the world). ) markets. It's a complicated matter and I understand why Nossiter wants to let his subjects talk. There is Robert Mondavi, the patriarch of Napa's wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc have faced the resistance of local vignerons and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker Daumas Gassac, an iconoclastic opponent of Mondavi's plans and a crusader for wines that express local fear. There is Robert Parker himself, expressing some discomfort with his influence, while refusing to stop writing about the wines he favors. There is a "flying winemaker" Michel Rolland, a consultant for dozens of wineries around the world, advising them on how to make Parker-friendly wines. There are many other fascinating personalities in this document. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will want to look for a ten-piece series and a theatrical version of this movie. But even if you are not for wine, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization change many of the world's oldest and most developed traditions. Impacts on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
