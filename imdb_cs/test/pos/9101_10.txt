I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies ever since Up in Smoke. This film has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What more would anyone want? I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to sit back and forget all the problems in the world and has a good laugh. Although the film does not do well in theaters, it is certainly a cult classic. I suggest that someone see the movie pick up the first D album, because many jokes are just fun if you heard songs (such as JB Sasquatch's obsession and epic battle against the devil). Laughter is guaranteed even if you haven't heard their music, but the songs are so great that you can't pass them.
