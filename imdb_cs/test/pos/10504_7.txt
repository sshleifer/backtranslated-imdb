<----- Minor Spoilers -----> <br /> <br /> A woman gets pregnant but not a husband. It develops "something" in it, or at least what her husband thinks. She goes through a lot of hard times while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her husband contacts Professor UFO and tries to find out what's wrong with her. Minor Spoilers ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better or at least less predictable, but the movie is catchy and it's me and mine the nurse hooked the whole movie without any problems. Acting is very good and filming is much better than usual if you compare it to normal b-extraterrestrial film. The effects are good and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really nice and apart from a silly sister in that scene they are very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie and I can recommend it if you like an alien / monster-abduction movies! 7/10 - The story could have been somewhat less predictable.
