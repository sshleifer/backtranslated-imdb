Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A nice high school student is described as a relentless terror in this tense filled TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in the city. He makes friends, he has a friend and everything seems to be going. That is until she gets a menacing and scary phone call while babysitting. She is raped after more phone calls. in most of the film, she seeks to find evidence that the person did rape her. Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS release from Goodtimes Stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Accessories: No videos from good home videos. Final Thoughts: This tension filled for TV film was done in 1978 so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty bad. This may be a little boring, but if you're patient, the end is pretty good.
