As a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I must say it's one of the best I've ever seen. There is nothing special about the plot, but you enjoy it. Like most genre movies. This movie is packed with action and not a spectator of its audience. It's such a damn fun when I watch my smile all the time. It also has an impact on future films like Kill Bill. (Many Kill Bill sound effects come from this movie, for example.) This is necessary for all known Kung Fu viewers. The form open to closing this movie is full of fights that are really some of the better I've seen in the genre. There are few Kung Fu movies out there that measure up to the sheer magic and entertainment of this film. So if you're looking for the Great Kung Fu movie for sure.
