I'm a huge fan of big, loud, cheesy, totally stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air, and so on. In a series of fires he tells a story and tells it well. With credibility and excitement, she also addressed several important moral issues that really convince you. The final shot of the film is Eastwood and Russo, who sit on the steps of the White House and watch the pigeons to the soft, calm music and feel a deep sense of satisfaction. It was because I took care of the characters and I was happy that their story came to a happy conclusion. It was like a real story. Clint Eastwood is like an aging secret service agent tortured by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, fantastic. Brilliantly expresses his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, a scary predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 with an open story about his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, does not lie to him, does not laugh at him, but tortures him with his unbearable friendliness until the last moment. Like this exciting main plot, there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have excellent chemistry on the screen and the director wisely doesn't allow it to dominate too much, but keeps it as part of a background that works nicely. To sum up, I love this movie because it has a mind.
