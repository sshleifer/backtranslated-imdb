I saw this movie when it was released to theaters. It certainly doesn't matter what I remember that I forgot about the title until recently. One friend found him through online search. One dark night is somewhat unusual for the thrilling / horror genre of time in that it contains no blood. It's a teen variety fear, but teens are decent in their own way. It's a nice, old-school movie with props and scenes that reflect times. For example, our hero rides a motorcycle without a bucket for his brains. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative value was not available for going to DVD. Some reel changes are a bit harsh, but they won't be removed from the story. As already mentioned, the colors are bright and the lighting is very good. Adam West plays a somewhat smaller part in this film than RayMar's son. Fortunately, his role as a revolutionary and indifferent husband is short. The story follows the course of the film. Unlike many horror movies of that time, one dark night is a great thrilling story that gives the viewer time to absorb what's going on. unforgettable. RayMar's telekinetic skills are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull out coffins, open them, and move bodies. In the final stages, attention was paid to great detail. Rotting, worm riddles of the dead look quite real.
