This film had everything that one wanted when he saw it originally, at the end of the decade of the 1960s. It was extremely entertaining and provided a contemporary look at the many changes that took place during this period - and continued - in connection with the Black Power movement, Vietnam and the unstable movement that followed the quieter, pre-war post-war 1950s. Br /> <br /> All this and one of the most fun movies, then or now. I recently looked at it. His humor is so funny and his message is so strong. And when you look at it now, you get it all, and at the same time you get more enjoyment from its "period work." and an excellent record of this historic, turbulent era.
