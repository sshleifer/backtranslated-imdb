Batman returns is considered to be good when he talks about superhero movies. His predecessor, Batman, in my opinion, is by far the largest and most interesting of the comics genre. For one to say that Batman returns was disappointing, he or she fully watched the movie and considered playing Danny Devito as Penguin. Devito and Walken offer some unforgettable moments. The story of Batman is supposed to be dark and Tim Burton fulfilled as a comic depicts Batman. Batman returns provides comical relief, action, tension and imagination; and should not be considered "stupid", even though we are all entitled to our own views.
