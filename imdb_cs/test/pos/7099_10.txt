This film has the appearance and the impression that it has been compiled in a matter of days like Plan 9 from space. Despite this, it is still a classic position among my favorite Creature features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, come to the Dr. Lab Edelman seeks a cure for their nighttime anti-social behavior, such as killing people. In the meantime, kindly Dr. Edelman discovers the body of Frankenstein Monster. Being obsessed with bringing him back to life (a common sign feature between scientists, madmen or otherwise) goes against his better judgment, resulting in the chaos of monsters and madness. One of the finals of the universal classics of his time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), evaluates 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven stole the show when a good doctor broke down after being infected with Dracula's blood and became a half werewolf / vampire creature who got to the tragic end. In 1 hour 7 min. packs a pretty blow. A good addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** off *****
