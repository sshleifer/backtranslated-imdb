At first I am a huge Buddy Holly fan. I grew up to know who it was, and I knew all about that fateful plane ride that just quenched three incredibly bright flames. But I never really listened to his music. I heard a lot about it, yes, but not until I sat down with the intention of doing some of it, so I really came to see the real Buddy Holly. And let me tell you that my world is different now because of him. Because of this adoration for such an incredible man, I bought The Buddy Holly Story without seeing it before. I'm torn for my opinion on this movie. Maybe it's because Buddy feels so alive that I couldn't see Gary Busey in this role. I admit he did a nice job, but his singing sounded so forced. It seemed as if he knew he didn't sound a bit like Buddy, so he used too much energy to try a similar sound. He succeeded in some parts of the film. But others .. Ouch. The film overcame a few years, but I feel that displaying this time span could have been handled much better. I had a hard time differentiating at what moment certain events were happening in Buddy's life. I also had a serious problem with some historical inaccuracies. I think the worst thing was showing crickets. I understand how their real names could not be used, and how for simplicity there were only two of them in the movie .. and maybe it was a good thing. Because the background vocals were mysterious and I didn't like the way they were displayed as an obstacle to Buddy's career. Something else that really didn't make any difference to the movie, but it bothered me was Gary Busey's teeth. They wore me! Buddy Holly had much better teeth. I don't know why I noticed ... but I did. I'll finish this review on what I felt was the best part of the movie: Buddy's Last Performance. His last call to Mary, the performance of Big Bopper, brought him and Richie Valens to the podium, followed by the frame. It scared me, and I feel it effectively shows the audience how Buddy Holly was so vivid and energetic at one point, and that his flame was radiating in the blink of an eye. It was a beautiful way to portray this terrible tragedy I think. Good movie, despite obvious problems .. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Some obvious flaws that could use some work ... but not wrong.
