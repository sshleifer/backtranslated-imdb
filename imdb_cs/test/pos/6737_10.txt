I love this movie. The cast was amazing in displaying their different characters. Judith Ivey so well portrayed a weak, dreadful, addict who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self-confident character that it was a relief to see the figure's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was as appealing in his role as a somewhat decisive Jewish mother, devoted woman and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz played their roles as well. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that go through challenging times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you'll love the movie.
