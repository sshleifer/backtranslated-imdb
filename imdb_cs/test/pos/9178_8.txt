It was a romantic, simple, fun movie. I really enjoyed it and I would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it, Will Smith was funny, nervous, nervous, sweet and just a simple boy who was hit by love. It was nice to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost, what to do or say. It was great. He was great, as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I expected to be just as good, I thought there were moments in the movie when Will got the shaft, doing everything he could to be a good guy and still being wrong. The end was romantic and happy and it was great. I saw it several times and I would watch it again. Funny, movie, something you can't see. She felt that the old age was a fresh new look.
