It's always a well-known and important overhead device for setting the film's atmosphere within the first 5 minutes. In decisive introductory scenes, the film should push through and make viewers aware of and interested in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find an example of the best. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Scene * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens with a very Hitchcock scene of a pretty blond lady in her apartment, with a radio. He wanders, applies lipstick, rises up, and ignores the serial killer's free space. Of course, the serial killer is in her house, watching her movements, the knife in her hand. He hears the noise, looks into the room and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the very moment of his screams, he turns and struggles with a maniac controlling a knife that stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and frightening act .... <br /> <br /> ... then something happens. When a woman in her deadly cramps, the killer sits and pulls out a cigarette to watch his victim die. Before he finds a lighter, he lights a cigarette ... from someone else in the room! The camera comes out and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some make notes, some shoot, some record death, and that lady takes a lot of time to die, and does a very hammy job too. When viewers realize what's going on, and the scene is part of the film, the thrilling and horrifying scene takes on the element of humor. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler at the end of the scene * <br /> <br /> I emphasized this opening scene for several reasons. First, it perfectly displays the atmosphere of the whole movie. Hitchcock or De Palm-style Thriller, with some very disorienting and even black humorous moments. - It represents a central theme (the difference between "movie screen death" and "snuff death", a problem that is further elaborated in the film), and ultimately introduces the viewer to the characters, all as quietly as possible. The story of Mute Witness Center extends around Billy Hughes, an American specialty make-up artist who works on a film set and is shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. . Billy can't talk, but he communicates in sign language through his sister. After the evening shooting, Billy accidentally finds himself in the warehouse accidentally, and while trying to escape, witnesses that two crew members are doing what it seems like a porn movie. film. Suddenly, her escape from the store is a matter of life and death. The first half of the film is undoubtedly powerful and completely closed. Billy's saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she is unable to pronounce the sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the movie is the fact that it is not crowded with women screaming). There are some absolutely distracting moments, and some wonderful set-pieces of real tension (corridor, and elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is smooth and the entire first half is in itself an incredibly satisfying experience. The second half of the film presents new concepts. While there are still some exciting moments, the emphasis is on the twists of the plot. New characters are introduced that are ambiguous on whose side they are. While there's nothing wrong with the second half of the movie, it's not until the first half. There are some elegant moments of black humor that perfectly blend together and cut off some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically Billy's sister and her fiance who happens to be the director of the movie Billy works on) that they almost destroy the movie just because they are poorly positioned and / or misspelled and destroy the pace. - Eventually, the twists and turns of fire are fast, and the film's climax is reasonably tense as the first half. There are a few things the movie really does. work. The barriers to communication that Billy has to face, either as a mute or as an American in Moscow, mean that an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress, who plays Billy, Natasha Zudin, does a great job in the movie, with eye-catching on-screen surveillance and great performance, and finally, as a whole, but especially in the first half of the film, which is a study in Alfred Hitchcock's impulse / thriller. <br /> <br /> As I said before, although there are some horrible comic moments in the movie that really don't need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective strip of dark humor that appears in the film without the need for Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (sister and filmmaker) to turn their scenes into an unusual sit-com. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly pleasing thriller, and perfect for a group viewing on Halloween. (Definitely better than the usual horror movie ...!)
