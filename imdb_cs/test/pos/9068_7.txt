The story in this movie is quite an unlikely B grade thing, but the script called for the fearsome guy to play lead, and in 1940, it meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is in his most beautiful place on this island as the owner of Stephen Danel, who gets the prisoner in his custody to work on his island diamond mine. On arrival, they find out they are slavers who can be defeated or killed at the whim of Danel. Only two things seem worse than slaves; Danella's wife and monkey. The monkeys will check it off so much that its violence against them is likely to lead to the only mass that slaves get. Lorre is perfect here in his role and crawling across the screen in industrial power. Although the scenario is not Casablanca caliber, the cut is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very attentive story, but I'm not sure what niche this movie has filled. Too long for a short subject and too short for a feature film, I'm not sure how it was sold to theaters. <br /> <br /> I first caught it for the first time at night / early morning showing TCM. Lorre fans will not want to miss this if they haven't seen it.
