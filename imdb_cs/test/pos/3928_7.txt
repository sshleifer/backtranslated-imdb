I don't think this film deserves a low rating that most of them give it. It's one of the best "teen" horror movies I've ever seen; and it says a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to support it, characters and conspiracies break innumerable horror stereotypes, and it has nothing to do with the other horrible pieces we've recently submitted. (A clear example is the thoughtless "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes can be downright boring, except for the beginning, although some minor light errors can be easily seen. But when the village arrives, the horror begins - another, twisted, horror movie. <br /> <br /> With the fence and details are small things; the characters are this film's strongest point, given that so many clich√©s are broken in it. For example, two major male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means the idiotic we're used to; although Dalton might be better off in this stereotype, he is the only one who pays for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are really, terribly terrible, creating tense moments scattered throughout the film. Finally, even though everything is politely explained, it is easy to understand that things that do not help survivors will not be so easy. The only mistakes I see and that do not mean continuity (IE, Carly, who has not found her own finger in the unconscious Bo Pockets) is the illumination that is uncomfortable for the first 30 minutes. Although it is a conspiracy and effect, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters in Ambrosia, the little village in the middle of nowhere, so I will. It was quite argued that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a wax house?", "Where do they get all the waxes?" If people pay more attention to the film, it would not be a rebellion. The Sinclair brothers did not build a wax house; their mother worked on the creation of real wax figures and exhibited in the museum. And the scenario where the unfortunate Paris Hilton character encounters her premature death is the answer to the second question; what about all the personal items (cell phones, cars, clothes) of dead people? Using their third brother as a connection to the exterior is quite debatable that the Sinclair twins should get the money they need to buy a wax by the WWII fashion. So, aside, I think the film deserves much more than it gets, and no one should lose the chance to look at it. So go see the Wax House. Now.
