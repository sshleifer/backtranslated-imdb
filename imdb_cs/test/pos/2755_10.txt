In my opinion, Flatley destroyed his first show with his absurd ego. He was disrespectful of his dance partner, trying to encourage each of them and not knowing the Riverdance spirit. It's good that he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new man's lead, is great, and when he and Jean Butler dance, it becomes a spell! Eileen Ivers 'fiddling is overwhelming (as Noel Eccles' percussion) and Maria Pages 'Fire Dance' is worth the admission! When the pages and Ivers get wide open at the end of a music duet show, it's a real treasure. I agree that editing is not free, but no technical flaw can suppress this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one who gets. There was never anything like Riverdance! That's the right one!
