I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but unlike my German colleague, whose review appears here, I think he was perfectly cast as a neurotic, drug-like character in this movie. She has all the nuances of perfection and reminded me of a few acquaintances who had a similar taste in "recreational chemistry." I saw this movie, but once, 10-15 years ago, and that's the only part of the movie that was indelibly engraved on my mind. I'm not saying it too often, but in this case I'll be: Bravo, Sean Penn! As far as the story is concerned, it is based on reality, so it is a tragedy that people will sell their country's secrets to the then enemy. Penn showed again what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use the freedoms you have, paid in blood; do not violate the law.
