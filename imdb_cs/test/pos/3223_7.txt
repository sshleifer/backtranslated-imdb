Every time I watch this show, I just want to turn it off and curse the creator to lose their weekly week. Dialogues, or monologues, rather than just bragging about infinitely about anything, are just boring. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly endless commotion about how a particular food (I forgot what it was, maybe pasta with meatballs) can always turn dinner into the Gilmore family into total war. And that was just a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a lot of completely zero-content lines every time. The scripts they use must be huge. But then once in a while something happens. Babbling stops and suddenly these amazing silent, emotional moments are. For example, this week it was Lorelai's break-up at a real estate agency. I just thought it was the best piece of television I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is worth it.
