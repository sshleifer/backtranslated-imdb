Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The storyline is simple but effective. The actors are good (two inches for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialogues are even very clever. From start to finish, action leaves your breath, you just can't escape ... There's blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a perverted feeling that goes far beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Certainly not: "Grandma" is not another slash, it's actually a classic of its own ... It deserves the success it had and is even more successful when it comes with re-release. Congratulations!
