As a child of 90 years I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say I enjoyed it and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why; the cartoons of the early 1990s had something special; I don't know if it was an atmosphere of uncertainty, a generational change. But "Tiny Toons" retained the vibration of the 1990s and added one of the most popular, humorous and underrated cartoons ever created. Memories are dark, but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show. Easily, no other caricature made me laugh in a tender way (before they get into the dark teen-oriented sitcoms). The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a real leading character. Each individual character was cheerful and deserved to be called a leader.
