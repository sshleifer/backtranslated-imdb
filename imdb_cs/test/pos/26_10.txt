This movie has its critics, and Courtney's fey dresser can offend some people (who, frankly, need a good smack upside down) - but the film's top notch in every direction: engaging, engaging, relevant. Finney is naturally bigger than life. Courtney is the ideal foil. I thought the performances were terribly powerful in both leaders, and Courtney's character provides a lot of dark humor. The period is well captured, the support cast well chosen. This is to be seen and enjoyed as gentle cordial. I wish it was on DVD ... (* sigh *) ...
