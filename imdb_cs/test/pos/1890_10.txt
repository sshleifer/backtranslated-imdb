The screaming man, shot exclusively in Bulgaria, is a cheerful love story between two rich ugly American types and a murderous hotel maid of gypsies. William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a taxi driven by the cheater Yegor. Things start to frighten when Tatoya, the maid, Yegor's murders, and William and the mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain into William's head. The robots eventually get involved, as well as gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with prissy little streamers, and an All-Of-Me-style physical comedy figure in a war with a voice in his brain that controls half his body . The screaming man is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most strange tracking I've ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab, is complete with a giant scar on his forehead and blue pajamas in the hospital, runs square and scares the crowd) and falls down. -steps of a murderous scene that had a whole screening of audiences screaming to laugh. The whole thing is a damn rebellion from start to finish, and I'd recommend it to every physical comedy fan, Bruce Campbell or B-films in general.
