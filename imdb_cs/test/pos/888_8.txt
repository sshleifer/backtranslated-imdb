Well, SWORD IN MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, despite the most negative reactions I've heard about it and the suspiciously tardy DVD release, I couldn't help but pick it up - any movie is better than most of the other movies in my Eyes: D Perhaps the low expectations of the advantage was because I was quite pleasantly surprised when I found the movie to be quite enjoyable. The attacker kills a number of ministers who have been involved in the revolution that has seized the throne, and the government's chief swordsman has the task of identifying the culprit. It does not mean long, but the answer is not the one he wanted to hear. Despite prolonged flashes, we learn why, and the history of the fencer and killer, and the revolution. The film is typically melodramatic for Korean film and definitely a serious tone - no HK style comedy here. The story may be difficult to trace initially, but in the end it makes sense. The film gets a little angry at the end, but nothing worse than Chang Cheh's movie, and for the most part I found it nice. Production values ​​are high to capture some good cinematography. Match scenes are not at the level of better HK wu xia movies, but they may not be intended - fighting is "more realistic" in that they are less like choreographic dance routines, but some are wire and occasional cgi that put the movie into "wu xia" . Unfortunately, the film does not have the best cast, with leadership being a tad lacking magic and sometimes difficult to distinguish. There is a young lady in the film, who I don't think I saw her before, but makes the best impression of some basic cast - not only because you see her nekkid ... or maybe she is: p The film lacks the magic and grace of better HK wu xia, and maybe even beauty, but I wish that HK made them half of the good one - TWINS EFFECT 2 doesn't give me hope that it will happen anytime soon, though Tsui Hark certainly still has it in him if he can get finance and cast. SWORD IN MOON is by no means going to my favorite list of wu xia, but it's a whole heap better than ROMANTIC SIZES or LEGEND OF GOLD LAKE - maybe even better than BICHUNMOO, even though I like the movie a little more on second viewing. It's probably nowhere near wonderful MUSY, but it's a completely different matter. SITM is likely to receive a second track within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it.
