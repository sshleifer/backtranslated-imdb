I had to be about ten years old when my uncle took me with my brother to see this martial arts movie at "DRIVE IN" on the Long Beach circuit. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD", from which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember are the different scenes that left my imprint on my mind. My brother always reminds me of a movie, though it has been forever because we've seen a movie. From time to time throwing a flight I would take a look at it in the rentals and from time to time I would check on the web and for some reason it seems that it is never available or no one knows what movie I'm talking about. If I knew that if it was available, I'd like to buy the movie. If anyone is aware of its availability, please inform me.
