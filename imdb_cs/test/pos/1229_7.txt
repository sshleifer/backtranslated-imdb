In my opinion, directing, editing, lighting and playing (minus Franco) were very good. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised and overwhelmed by this film. I didn't expect much like camera angles, sound, etc. But in these areas the film wasn't bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, I personally felt frustrated with both characters. because I wanted so badly that these two characters came together. And I felt as if Travis (Franco) character was not eventually hit or altered after Terri commits suicide. Although, this is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco to express emotions (of some sort) very well in this film. I saw a couple of Frank's other movies and he just can't pull me out when the scene calls for real emotions or facial expressions. The only thing he brings to the film is the possibility that more people will watch this movie. On the other hand, the portrait of Rachel Miner Terri was good and seems to have a clear future ahead. I really saw and felt sadness and emptiness in her nature and I felt to her. I just wish I could see more of Terri's life before the film was over. <br /> <br /> This movie was good for a short film, but it doesn't want you any more at the end. I wish it was just a little longer for the characters to develop a little more. Still, I hope to see more director and crew films in the future. :)
