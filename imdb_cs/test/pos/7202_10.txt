I have to admit I slept in the cinema watching the first Asterix movie ... but this is just FANTASTIC! It's really funny and leaves the first kilometer away. He has a lot of gags and funny situations that made me laugh from the first minutes of the movie and I stopped laughing when I got into the car to get home. I repeat: this movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real girl !!
