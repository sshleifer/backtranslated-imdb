There are many factors for comedy to work with: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't be afraid to take risks. 2. If somebody or anything deserves to be fun, do it and continue to do it, but mainly: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUNNY! !!! "Chaser's War Against All" succeeds in all these three things. In fact, the show proved to be so popular and so humorous that just months after his first episode, the DVD of the first season was released. I picked it up in a few days from its release and hitting the floor with laughter and had so much fu # @ tears in my eyes - that's good, good! In short and save me blabbing on about the show- watch, buy, podcast what will make the watch fu $ ing ing the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go CHASER !!!!
