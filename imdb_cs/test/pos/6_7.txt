I was fortunate enough to have seen this movie on the eve premiere, and although I didn't expect it, I really liked the movie for the most part. Rescue and Sea Effects have been amazing to watch and certainly provide the edge of the seat with tight moments, probably all the more that they know there are guys who do it for a living. The weaker parts of the film revolve around stereotypical scenes. I won't spoil the movie, but it really follows the line of the officer and the gentleman, and those moments give him a bit of a cheesy aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said over this movie, it's pretty good and it's worth a look if you can get through the clich√©s.
