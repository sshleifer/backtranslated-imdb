Since this cartoon was made in the old days, Felix speaks using cartoon bubbles and animation style is very rude compared to today. However, compared to his contemporaries, he is a pretty good cartoon and still holds good. This is because despite his age, the caricature is very creative and fun. Felix meets a guy whose shoe shop is made up because he can't sell shoes. Well, Felix needs money to go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy in the store that he gets every shoe sold. Felix spreads chewing gum all over the city and soon people get stuck and leave shoes - hurrying to buy new shoe store. Grateful, this guy gives Felix $ 500! But the owner, Felix, wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix makes up the way to get there. When Felix finds himself there, he walks into the studio and bothered a little. Along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. Eventually, however, Felix appeared and offered a film contract. Hurray!
