That was a great movie. Is it heaven? hell? or something in between? I disagree with the many reviews of this movie that says it's a display of hell. It's not clear whether the opening scene starts with a movie or it's a flashback from the end. Furthermore, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but perhaps somewhere in between. The review I read on IMDb says it's hell, but I disagree. Note that perhaps good people who commit suicide may not be condemned to hell ... this is just one religious belief. This is really a thinker, and I / I recommend it to anyone who likes this type of movie. Definitely worth it!
