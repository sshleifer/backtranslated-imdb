Great movie, very good 7/10. Tom Hanks was at his usual best, heavy drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from his Communist oppressors! Based on a true story, he tells us how the West is throwing money and weapons at a problem and expecting them to leave. Well, it was gone, though temporarily. See who we (the British, among other things) are now fighting with the same people that the US gave weapons, training and money in the 1980s. This film will always evoke political ideas. people watching it, but showing a very nice story. However, as soon as the main goal, ie the deprivation of Communists from Afghanistan, is reached, it is seen how quickly the people's situation is forgotten. This movie was good, it was deserved 7/10. This told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the ensuing secret US operations in some detail and was dramatized well. While it's a good movie, I recommend it to people, but some people won't enjoy it, it's a serious movie about good (US) in evil (Russia) is not your thing!
