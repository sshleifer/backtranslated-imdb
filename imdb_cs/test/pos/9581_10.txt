Another masterpiece that needs a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and it's worth looking. Just a great game about many things, especially about euthanasia, "decency", religion and basic human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with a problem like a heavily handicapped child, but to bind parents in their love for "Jo" and themselves. As the couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman fit perfectly into both acting virtuosity and bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life. I recently saw the great performance of Bates in "Butley", who was released as a movie a few years after "Joe Egg" and plays a teacher both in cynical, intellectual and funny, though Butley is much darker than his Brya character. If you throw in such great performances in "The Go-Between," "Women in Love," "Whistle Down the Wind," "The Caretaker," and "Georgy Girl," not to mention what's more obvious. "Zorba the Greek" and I would say Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and other great British actors of his time. Director Peter Medak is also one of my favorite favorites, "The Ruling Class", released in the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which consists of a career year in every book. He had a little fake filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two gems will mark him as a great director.
