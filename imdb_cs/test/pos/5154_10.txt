During this film, I laughed a few times loudly, even though I looked at it briefly and thought it was completely different. I adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as presented by these stunningly beautiful boards. Andersson gives us something else here. It shows us something I haven't seen since his last film. It is exceptionally compositional and, thanks to its method of camera fixation and the action that takes place before us, opens the door to humanity and follows a place that reflects our own lives, our little lives. It's a powerful thing. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to take place, creating the opposite sense of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is nothing but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe most of the scenes, if not all, are, according to his designs, from scratch. I can't recommend this movie high enough. For me it took place and I came out of it when I witnessed a world that was frayed and beautiful, stiff and painful, barren and gorgeous. Suddenly a stranger and familiar. This film is brilliant and life confirming. I know because I came out smiling and felt amazing. It took him seven years. If he did this movie, he would still be there with greats.
