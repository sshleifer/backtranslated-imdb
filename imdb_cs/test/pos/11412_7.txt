When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I've never seen the original, so I watched it was unique. When Stranger Calling was advertised on TV, the trailer ended. I've never seen a trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised how well it turned out. One day I followed him and decided to buy it, and now I'm lucky to have done it because I thought it was a very nice movie that is a nice little movie we own. It's a lot of unfair treatment, and if you're interested in this movie at all, don't listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not as bad as an actress because they all do it, and she did a great job in this movie, so everyone who hates, walks through, lightens and actually tries to enjoy this movie for what it is; Funny, lousy bopper, popcorn flick. If you haven't seen it, please do it because it's much more fun than many other slasheres that were recently made ...
