*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** This was an incredibly honest (uh-huh, uh-huh) picture for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions had a chance by doing so, Motion Picture Association of America defended certification a film that openly shows a heifer pushing a syringe full of heroin into his arm. Frank Sinatra had a chance to play an addict musician and fall on the face in a role that required at least twice as many games ever. All these wins have paid off, the movie is a classic, though it's not perfect. Nelson Algren's novel may be great, but it has too much time to fit comfortably in the two-hour movie 'The Man with the Golden Arm' is 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However, in my opinion it is not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) who makes the movie, but the other characters and their sub-conspiracy, all includes Frankie. In the end, it's not just Frankie who has addiction, everyone and everything seems to be dependent on him, and he feels very enthusiastic about it. When the pressure is too high, the drums start pounding the soundtrack, and Frankie goes down the street with her well-dressed "friend" Louie. It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatry's musical career was in fact really so, but in the early 1950s he was in limbo between the days of touring with big bands and the Las Vegas era. "From here to eternity" introduced him as a serious actor, and his singer career also bounced, but "The Man with the Golden Arm" was still a significant challenge, the show sank or floated with performance. It reaches with such skill that for a few minutes when I forgot, I followed Frank Sinatra, had to know junkies and use that knowledge to the maximum. Wilder's masterpiece "Lost Weekend" puts more emphasis on the sociological causes of dependence in "The Man with the Golden Arm." While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in "The Lost Weekend") seems to fight mostly against each other, Frankie Machine is plagued by outside forces and attacks the needle. Neither approach is entirely correct or wrong, mostly because addiction cannot be fully explained, but this film seems to have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's inner struggle. *** Spoiler ** One of the problems I have with this movie is the clich√© of relying on the "cold turkey departure". I realize that the 'Man with the Golden Arm' probably set the trend rather than follow it, but that doesn't mean it would be better. At the beginning of the film, Frankie kicked all his performances with the help of a physician and a medical facility of some sort. Of course, the drama of the movie requires him to jump down, but I found the All-American ideal that one has to face his own problems (or maybe with the help of a good woman) from here. Going cold turkey and going to sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of "The Lost Weekend" was similar, but in my opinion it was a little less rosy.
