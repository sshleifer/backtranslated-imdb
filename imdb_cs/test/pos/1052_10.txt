"Christmas in Connecticut" is an absolute jewel and must see Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, the forerunner of Martha Stewart, is a journalist and not a ultra housewife - the perfect wife, mother and home goddess. The only thing is that there is none of these things - total false. Unfortunately for her, she'll find out. Its publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant Sydney Greenstreet comedy tour), will have a clear idea of ​​inviting the famous war hero to Elizabeth's "perfect farm" for the Christmas season. The only thing is no farm, "perfect" or otherwise. Comedy includes how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under the wraps so she won't lose her job. Elizabeth is a colleague, John, happens to have a farm in Connecticut, so she solves this problem. But he wants to marry Liz, but he doesn't want to marry him. He offers his marriage, even though he knows he doesn't feel like him. Even so, he makes an offer and assures her he is willing to wait. And here Barbara Stanwyck, like Liz, adds one of the most destructive handcuffs I've ever heard. With perfect innocence, he says, "Could you wait so long?" OUCH! In addition, the scene between Una O'Conner and S.Z. Sakall are cheerful. They don't seem to resemble each other (even if they actually do one suspect). They are housewives and S.Z. Sakall's shattered English is offset by Nora's strangled pronunciation of his name ("Mr. Basternook"). "My name is FELIX!" It's amazing how these black and white movies are Christmas. Great character work of all involved. Don't Miss This!
