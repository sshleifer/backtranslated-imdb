Above all, I must say that I am a huge LOST fan. Everyone who does the show, I love them. It's all in it, really. I'm glad they have great people doing it, for example Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe J.J. Abrams. And of course full recognition of Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. Anyway, the final of Season 2 is definitely one of the best episodes of LOST ever !!! Living together, Die Alone focuses on the story of Desmond David Hume on how to get to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick plays that character! The creators of the show would be very stupid to let the old people die on us. So in LOST there survived the 65 day aircraft crash. 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been there for sixteen years and others have been there because God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. I hope we get the answers we need in Season 3. My voice is nine.
