"I'm ... proud of my head," said Mike Nesmith. It should be because this film, which many of us mocked or studied and studied by film professors, works on many levels. Yes, it's unusual. For many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers were filming a movie and trying, "You'll figure it out." serving the public. TV shows mainly concern the sale of soap and toothpaste rather than entertainment. That The Monkees went out of the box for a short time so that "Head" is proof of the band's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite where your head is. Get one thing straight: "Head" is not the Monkees TV show. So here we have a "psychedelic document" about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on this subject. "Head" is a movie that could only come from "inside the box". 1968, The Cast of the Monkees and the crew were seasoned and tired of the professionals who saw their share of promise and disappointment. The film was a deliberate attempt to relocate the market. So he did three things: Make a movie as Monkees imagined. Most importantly, rediscover the group to a person who is not subordinate to their old bosses - and yas, hipper than before. Make a movie that reveals US attitudes to disseminating information. So the "head" is about media manipulation and its net result: fraud. The media should inform, educate us about what is happening in the world as a whole, and finally ask us to form opinions on these events that can form ideas into positive actions. So we assume that the information we absorb is complete and undistorted - otherwise, how can we create a valuable conclusion about any idea that a book, a newspaper, or a TV show represents? In one of the street talks in "Head", a man admits, "I looked at newspapers or TV in years." Is that smaller or better man? Even drug parallels are a subtle veil of "things are not what they seem." Remember the old joke: "Everything you know is bad"? The scenario begins with the public admission of Monkees that it owns a "produced image" and runs with football - literally. Is the football scene in the film a visual expression of the whole idea of ​​"Head"? Is the film a stream of consciousness? Is the film the culmination of smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences that appear in a film that suggest something else. My guess is that "head" is the culmination of motivation somewhere between intended and unintended. The insiders responsible for the "head" seem to be enjoying the merriment that takes place in the film, but there is anger - the anger at the chaos that characterized the late 1960s and anger at the way media, especially television, has changed culture negatively. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 1960s and still are, but producers of "heads" want you to know that poor "information" is a much greater danger. Wars were attributed to fraud and lies. What is the perfect way to spread misinformation than through television? The mysterious black box is repeatedly perceived as an obstacle for The Monkees and apparently all of us. In one scene, Peter sat coldly in the salon, holding a cone of melting ice cream, and asked by colleague Monkey, "What's the matter?" "I bought an ice cream cone and I don't want it." The film suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform but massively sell en mass. "Head" goes on: put some thought into someone's head and he happily goes. <br /> <br /> The creators know this and the danger is real. "Head" is one film that creates itself "how we go along", or is a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot meets advertising" as critics dreaded in 1968. Jokes are on The Monkees and us. Be careful what you ask, you can get it. Cheers: Real Guilt Joy. Very funny. Intelligent. Delight fans. Find the fabric, it's there. Incredibly weird. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tunage. Length is appropriate. Lots of great steamers, including my prophetic favorite: "Your time tragedy, young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Warning: Date. Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any ideas separately. At least twenty-five stories that blend in stop-and-go fashion. So he can easily thwart. It may seem that some are demanding. People who can't stand Monkees do not have to watch, although this in itself is not a reason to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill your ailing image tube or your sour burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Match, cut.
