The "two sisters fairy tale", disgusted as an Asian horror film, is in fact a complex psychological drama that engulfs the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised by the depth of this film. The decision of director Ji-won Kim to focus on telling the story rather than providing cheap terror has proved to be correct. Creating one of the most urgent new horror movies. "The Story of Two Sisters" tells the story, as the name suggests, two sisters Sui and younger Su-yeon, who, after spending time at a psychiatric institute, returns home to their father and apparently a gross stepmother. Since then, we have seen nurses deal with the gradual aggression and erratic behavior of their stepmother. To say what would happen next would be to spoil the whole experience. So I just leave it. The storyline is very tight. With characters nicely refined. Ji-woon Kim's focus on the small cast offers a much more detailed look at them and their relationships. In addition, each of the four main games has a completely different role and character. From the protective Su-me, the weaker Su-yeon, the visible uninterested father to the frantic and later lethal behavior of the stepmother. There is a great sense of mystery, with plenty of conspiracy not revealed to the end, even after the film still leaves much room for interpretation. Even after watching him once, the viewer will be forced to see him at least once so that he can understand him better. <br /> <br /> The actors fit perfectly into their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great pleasure to create them and it is an excellent example of such an act. Ji-woon Kim's direction is a slow pace and grip, building tension for horror movie scenes. While few of these moments are strong and frankly scary. Cinematography and score are a top step that further contributes to creating an atmosphere consistent with psychological film. "The Story of Two Sisters" is an example of how the horror genre is actually much more than a simple ride. With his strong focus on character and mystery, this is one complex movie that can easily seduce you when you watch it over and over again to better understand it.
