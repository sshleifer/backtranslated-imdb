As often happens when Manga is translated into live action, it is a bit lost in translation. However, this remains a highly entertaining film. The space is unusual and is presented in a quiet, decent style that prevails in Japanese movies (ha!). Special effects are a small 70th camp, but adds a film feel to the comic. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you're familiar with other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", this movie will appeal to you.
