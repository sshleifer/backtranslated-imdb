A good movie. <br /> <br /> I picked it up on a DVD at a local store. Â£ 2.99 looks like a good deal and is. Thing is a movie called "K Kill For". It took a bit of detective work to find out it's the original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK, it was rated 18 and right, although the standard of movies depends on the "ability to sell". When I saw Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, it should be 18. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's wonderful, Traci Lords, tends to make the scoreboard up to 18 years. Such shame. Traci is a great actress and should get a chance to appear in bigger and big budget productions. The ability to reverse what is referred to as B-Movies, at Fine Performance, is nothing short of amazing. Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress have long lived.
