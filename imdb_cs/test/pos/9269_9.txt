I went to "The Closer She Gets" knowing it was the story of a cancer filmmaker's mother. I expected it to be a very rough, depressing film. And while the subject is certainly emotionally shocking, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. This shows that the family is determined to face the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to lose faith in themselves, even in the darkest moments. The most moving moments for me are when this belief is revealed. Small notes that mother and family reveal to each other and reveal her (and their) will to survive and their defiant emphasis on love and family cohesion. In this way, it is an uplifting and deeply hopeful movie. We should all be so happy that we are surrounded by such a family at a time of serious illness.
