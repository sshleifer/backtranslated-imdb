What can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no "stars", with absolutely no bad performances, not one badly published dialogue line and cold violence on one side by the balanced warm "heart" of the protagonist in the story? It's a gem, a diamond, a small, precious western jewel that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. The West did not arrange great heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by spreading everyday men and women, farmers and ranches, merchants and miners and lumberjacks, girls and barkeeps and daytime entertainers, some perspective for wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. It is perhaps a very spiritual story, though it does not support any particular religion, even for non-Mormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.. The story, regardless of religious affiliation and belief, and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the train car comes to stranded medicine to show people. And in a true biblical spirit like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are guardian angels sent to a wagon train who must eventually head to the head with the evil incarnate Clegg clan who compares them to a snake in the garden. Eden, and regret what they have to do afterwards. It is the sweet folklore story of the West that hits every goal John Ford will focus on. Currently I have western Santa Claus, whose red outfit is covered with denim fur coat, whose red cap is replaced. Brown Stetson, carrying a burlap sack of gifts and a coil of rope. I added a Winchester rifle to my Santa with a curtain to put one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver in his waist. When people in the office ask why my Santa should carry weapons, I will simply say, "Snakes!" After all, it's not the spirit of the Christmas season where everyone should get what they deserve? Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes that characterize the story of this film are still as important as in the past.
