A few years before SCREAM spoofed slasher / horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young stuff know every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a risky situation, a small film made in Russia hit theaters without any grandiose claims. This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Playing the cast of strangers (except for the extremely short portrait of Sir Alek Guinness, whose scenes were allegedly shot eight years before the film was filmed), he told the story of the silent artist Billie, who is working on a film about a location in Russia produced and directed by her sister Andy's friend. She does not realize that the file has closed when she goes to retrieve her stuff and inadvertently encounters porn filming that becomes extremely bloody. Overcome with horror, she warns murderers of her presence, follows persecution, and eventually rescues Andy, who takes her home when alerting the police. The trouble is ... there is no body, no evidence that anything like that has happened. Still, the mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side of the story .... <br /> <br /> And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is a kind of film that requires observation similar to the most complicated, clever thriller, because just as it is a convoluted thriller, it's the one that pays its fees to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its selection of camera cuts, humor, Americans reacting in strange countries where they are helpless and angry with tension until they seem to have to snap. Although the story becomes too unlikely given that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of even more conspiracy, the film fails to deceive viewers with inexpensive footage (such as the sudden appearance of a person). the camera accompanied by violent violent waves) but with fear of the unknown and that death is just a shadow away. Very clever.
