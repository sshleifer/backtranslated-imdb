A fun, funny movie about German World War II spy (Julie Andrews!), Who falls in love with an American pilot (Rock Hudson) and tries to get a secret from him. For some reason this was challenged by critics and avoided the public in 1970 - I can't see why. It is beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting air combat. Also it has Andrews to do strip-tease (strictly PG material) and sing a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The film has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get into this movie - and it shows. Their love scenes lack sparkle and have zero sexual chemistry. Yet, he will present himself in OK. The film is a bit long (even directed by 105 min of the director I saw) and is too dark and serious at the end. Still worth catching. Try to see the directors lower ... the other one runs half an hour longer!
