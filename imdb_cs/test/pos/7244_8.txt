As always, Joan Hickson is amazing as Jane M. Subtle, sharp and conscious. I do not want to devote myself to her game skills because they are praised enough on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts because the rest of the cast seemed to be manually selected by director David Tucker. The performance of Liz Fraser as Mrs. Bent (Mother of Miss Nora) is a pleasure to watch. Subtle and deeply moving as a grieving mother addicted to alcohol that desperately loves and misses her daughter. Good long shot of her monologue (thanks to Tucker!), So you can enjoy it to the fullest. I moved when I first saw it when I aired it and I moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. Joanna Hole as Madge the tour-guide Very fun. She is on the verge of exaggeration, but her role may be. It's so funny that an overly organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on this bus is happy for me. Her reaction after she boarded the bus is great ... As always: to play comedy needs to be taken very seriously, and it does Mrs. Hole. I hope those two ladies have a good career (as I live in Holland I don't know if they have, not all theatrical productions can be googled ...) - their performance on screen deserves it. Pieter
