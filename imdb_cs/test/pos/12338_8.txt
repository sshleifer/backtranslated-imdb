Since Jason and his ilk have taken horror movies around the 1980s most every horror movie included a group of hormone-charged teens to be chopped into pieces with a focus on chopping and not tension. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early 1980s, doing what every good horror movie should do - bringing their worst fears to life while sitting around, just knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. Then you make the horrors that are brewing, just don't do it on a butcher's biology lesson. The story tells Mega Tilly before she had a short-lived turn with fame. The Big Chill "and then slipped back into the unknown in the early 1990s. Meg plays a frightened teenager just dying to get some of the classic girls' good graces. They tell her she can be part of their little group if they spend the night in The girls intend to scare her and cause her to leave the crypt, giving them a double reward - another torture of an outraged girl and an excuse to refuse her. \ t what she claimed to have discovered a way to go back from the grave and to return her great magical powers, his daughter does not believe it at first, but listens to the tape of his father's experiments that included his successful animation of small dead animals and his plans to emerge from the grave with the power to revive the bigger game and draw extra power from these animations.He also learns that she could inherit her father's power and may be the only one a person who can stop him if he actually gets up from the dead I think you know where this story is going, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same tomb in which Mega Tilly's character spends the night? I will mention that a commercial DVD containing this film looks somewhat humiliated compared to what you would expect from a movie that was made so recently. I saw it on TV in the mid-1980s and I remember it looks better than this. The problem is that the original film negative was never placed, so the DVD had to be printed. This means it comes with dirt and scratches. It's worth a look at all the horror fans. It was an independent film and an example of the kind of unusual things you could normally find on television late in the night, until the infomercial changed this period to a huge wasteland around 1986. This kind of film is only broadcast by the TCM Underground.
