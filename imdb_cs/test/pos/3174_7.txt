Extremely descending, well executed and reared "Rodeo" Western. They didn't need any curious stars, because all the cast members were ordinary people who told the real life story of the rodeo cheater and his entourage in the 1960s and 1970s. Hats, especially Slim Pickens for what I thought, was his signature, especially given that he was a rodeo clown in real life. His role far exceeded the mere clown role of deeply dealing with all the "ups and downs" of the hard nose rodeo and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Coburn were very well connected as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also, check out Anne Archer as Coburn Native American Love Interest in the second part of the movie. It must be one of her first roles. Not so flashy, perhaps as a "Junior Bonner", but also the rendering of the heart and its depiction. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel from time to time showing off this real film with insufficient ratings.
