This is a great movie. I read a brief synopsis and was unimaginable, but as I watched (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas), he grew up on me. It's such a nice change to see a movie where girls / young women aren't punished for their sexuality. Girls have a full license to explore and even make mistakes without ridiculous consequences. Some scenes are absolutely cheerful - and many of them are allegedly erotic scenes - which were not top or disgusting. Male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was great as a tousled piece - and what's great is that the movie doesn't make us hate so much. The other two younger male characters were also good without being exaggerated. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen that girls grow up and is quite capable of seeing their mistakes. But eventually pass and continue their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them.
