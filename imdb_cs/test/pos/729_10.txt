It might be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money on a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee it's worth watching), but I think it's completely missing a point. If your anticipated fast cars, T&A or a movie that will be announced for you then don't have to look at it, you'll be disappointed and amazed. This film was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think. The writer apparently gave many ideas and research behind this film and shows to the end, just remember to keep an open mind. Note: School scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of them were made in Toronto.
