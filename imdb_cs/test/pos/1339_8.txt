This is a hard film that needs to be reviewed because several factors need to be considered. Let's filter more judgment .. Are you interested in facts about the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you stand an independent, low-budget movie? Are you so objective that they don't like the film just because of its lack of stars or professional looks? Well, if you said yes, then you should have enough open mind to do this. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of the adult life of Dahmer and the subsequent murder murder, and is styled as an autobiography. It is not a charming, unrealistic account, which unfortunately was the theatrical film "Dahmer" (2001) was. The film begins with Dahmer, played quite convincingly by Carl Crew, sitting in a police car getting his flat raided. His thoughts on what he got there are presented to us in the past tense, narrative style that explains most of Dahmer's psychoses and motives that led him to commit murder almost 20 times. We know the character, both sinister and side that came slightly close to life. It is not anyone's fault, but Dahmer is that 17 people have died, but as a student of criminal psychology, I was more than pleased with his animal side, which was truly represented in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother and trying to find a company, but of course we are seeing his party, which everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual violence on the screen, most of which are suggestive in shots, such as blood splattering or a body that is hit by a blurry curtain. You see two deaths I remember, one of which is bloodless throat and the other is a man who is stuck alive into an acid barrel. Though you see nothing graphic, this cruelty and convincing performance of the crew and its victims make it a disturbing scene. And while the actual mutilation on the screen remains low, you'll see the results. There's a prop hand and a head or two, but it seems like it was disturbing the viewer and doesn't seem to be exploitative. In addition, these false anatomical pieces are where budget constraints are visible. Even though they are acceptable, they look like counterfeits to keep them from being distracting. The film actually ends before Dahmer's death in 1994, due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior. This is probably the only big difference from the real story, and the information that remains is, as I said, very true facts. The quality of the film might be better, the dialogue often sounds too calm and the action of several characters is a bit of a hammy, but it's not overboard. In my opinion, this is a faulty but ultimately honest and serious look at one of America's most remembered serial killers. I think it's safe to say that the movie is also unforgettable, and I respect it for overcoming my limitations, so that this story can be credibly backed up by a thoroughly excellent Carl Crew like Dahmer.
