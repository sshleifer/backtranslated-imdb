"Tesis", "Open your eyes" and "The Other" were proof of the talent and skill of Amenabar as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) were also defective films in their quest to outwit the audience, always offering one turn screw too much, favoring cheap excitement, twists and turns over depth and resonance. Luckily for all, Amenabar chose a theme for his new film that would not allow a surprising end to the characters and emotional ties that weigh them. <br /> <br /> The result is a small movie miracle, beautifully written, photographed, scored, acted and directed. Anyone taking part in this film delivers superb performance, behind and in front of the cameras, from a beautiful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film amazing authenticity) to the wonderful Aguirresarobe. lenses. <br /> <br /> The film effectively uses many relevant questions and emotions, solves the heart and mind with the same strength, and brings the ultimate strike that will stay with you long after the credits come back. This is a brilliantly made film that will not only dominate Spanish film, but will surely be a pleasant surprise when it opens abroad (Sony Classics has paid a record $ 6 million to distribute it). There's no stopping Amenabar ... Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
