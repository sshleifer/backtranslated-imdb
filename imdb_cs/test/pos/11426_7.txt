Seeing Laurel without Hardy in the movie seems strange, yet it's all fun. It's a great parody of what has become a classic silent film and shows the Statutes very well. While his photos with Oliver Hardy were great, these early solo efforts give you an idea of ​​how skillful he is in his craft and how big he could be if he continued the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as separate stars. The dance sequence with his real wife in the cafe scene is the best part of the picture, and has some pretty funny pieces to go with with Laurel's excellent dance steps. And the culmination of a bullfight is a gem, because even a bull takes pratfall. And I like the irony in the scene where he is buried in hats and wears his famous Laurel and Hardy bowler hat. Like I love the Laurel and Hardy team, and I feel that their comedy duo never was a fun thing to do, it's nice to see them once in a while (check out KENTUCKIAN's fight, which Hardy did with Duke) as another good example .)
