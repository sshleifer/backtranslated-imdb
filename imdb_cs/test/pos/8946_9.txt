Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor as opposed to other things from the Atlantic? How could I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6th for our late Valentines Day and we both enjoyed a good belly. Later we looked at another movie, but we decided we didn't want the movie experience to stay with us for dinner. Wait. This raises questions that are rarely discussed in the community, but I know three directors of funeral and humor is right about money. Without you, all the actors, directors and others did not work on Monday.
