This is a very underestimated film at least. As mentioned in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat relaxed and highly improbable scenario, but you'll find yourself saying, "Who cares?" when shooting with milk (or inserting a drink of your choice) through the nose. This was really due to the rare combination of actors in sync. While Kelsey Grammar is clearly a gifted actor ("Frasier", this film), supporting actors / actresses play their roles quite well. I found it interesting how they threw a part about Duane Martin, who shot a "big game" for the Navy basketball team. If any of you are a basketball fan, you will remember Martin from "White Men Can Jump" and "Above the Rim" and you will know that Martin had a short stint at the NBA with the Knicks. Nice how they threw credible character attributes like this. Rob Schneider's anal-retention character was a perfect move to Grammar's calm behavior. Lauren Holly played gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to succeed you. This is a movie that will make you laugh, even if you have seen it many times before ... comic pieces in this movie will certainly last. I was still laughing after 12 years. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my chickens?" "Uhhh ... no. This parrot ... from the Caribbean." "Well, don't let him fly ... it's dinner." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
