There are questions that sometimes move over us and have no answer. Two women gradually find themselves in each other's arms (as it sounds great, that's exactly what's happening) and fins that can't answer their own question of what defines their relationship when their own company has no name to what they have. they are. Deepa Mehta is somewhat mistakenly named FIRE, the first of the loosely coupled trilogies, linked here by theme elements and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as an uncontrolled erotic passion is not created here, because women - older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger, more masculine temperamental Sita (Nandita Das) realize that they share much more than ordinary thoughts. and affection for each other and for what they believe is their mutual passion despite the opposition facing their traditional husbands and families. As in water, FIRE is profoundly spiritual, although technically in the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, like the weight of a word, has a stronger meaning that ultimately goes beyond its definition). Yet it is a very beautiful image and a strong voice of a strong director.
