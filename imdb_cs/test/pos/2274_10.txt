In All Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for a woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a sense, a woman who saved the whole family. This is a heart-felt story about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. Such a stranger in a strange land. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, standing out like a painful thumb in Ukraine (apparently he would stay there like a sore thumb). But what he finds is much more than he had expected. This film will make you laugh and cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this movie, based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. From someone I talk to, this movie is somewhat different from the book. The book I collect is really good. However, this is a good movie, it has something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone tell an Oscar?
