Hollywood has transformed the mafia into a production line of production, from banal to superb, and despite some good acting and reasonable scenario (most of which is - for change - true!) This quest for "home entertainment" has to fall Slap bang on Wednesday. The script is not just obvious (all check boxes end with a check mark), but they spend a lot of time trying to create the best of others' pastiche. . The Godfather is most obvious, but there are other references. I'm not going to bother naming them. However, it is a good taste borrower! The producer seems to have set a quota for shots and murder (at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" I was told there are different versions of this production, so maybe it's just the version I saw. <br /> <br /> Gangsters don't make money to take money. Usually in fear. Some seem more murderous and chaotic about business than making money. They were the first to go first (in real life and here). "You can't make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano in one phase. One of the smarter gangsters, though all things are relative. He was a skilled white slave trader and drug dealer before being tied home to Italy. The old moustached Pete's school was chosen by new blood who wanted power and money for themselves and to break out of the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely doing business outside of themselves). The young Turk knew that they needed to be associated with other groups (especially Jews who knew how to wash money), and this is at least referenced and confirmed. What is not so clear is that most immigrant groups had their own mafia - but most of them made money and went legitimately. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man ready to kill if needed, but not unfair or stupid. His story was tragic in that he could make money in the world above and showed special abilities to avoid killing. With a little luck, naturally. Despite a number of decent names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), he is neither charisma nor talent. bring us and feel something. We are - only - passive observers in life we ​​are glad we cannot lead. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only sign was that it was more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can't get enough of a gangster genre that is better than watching the godfather 1 & 2 for the tenth time and it's even better - as a basic pastime - than a terrible failure that was Godfather 3.
