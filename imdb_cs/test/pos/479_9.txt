Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, a sexually determined suburban teenager fighting high school hell. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a middle-aged depressed man is still angry at the loss of his wife. Daphne attracts the world of prostitution because she promises to cure her with barely boredom and loneliness. When Buddy pulls Daphne out of his secret, he hires her to help him take the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Duncan Hotel, but details of the history of each character are revealed through dialogue and flashbacks. Their appointment will culminate in the final twist of the story. Both actors really understand and become special, bringing a convincing, honest performance. Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the whole movie, is real. The film dialogue is a natural, real life. The writer, Gorman Bechard, has undoubtedly done his homework because all the links are appropriate for industry and character. Daphne is intelligent but still eighteen. Buddy can be middle-aged, but it is still not a hackney naive type that is usually displayed in a movie. Daphne and Buddy's conversation is primarily concerned with their desperation and frustration of life, but at the right times it is still comical. Although the general mood is very relaxed, dialogue has its own liveliness, forcing viewers to become empathetic to the conditions of the character and uncomfortable in their straightforward vulgarities. The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scene and characters. Even existing independently of the film, the compilation actually expresses You Are Alone's central theme-of loneliness. You are alone is a less conventional piece that deals with concepts usually not spoken. Definitely worth seeing? it is the kind of provocative film that makes you question your own loneliness threshold.
