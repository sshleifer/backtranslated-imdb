Let's put aside the cultural aspects of this film for a moment, even if it's a very important aspect, and let's look at the simple fact that it is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands. He must live his sad days without any beam of hope. If each of these two women were alone, imagine what life everyone would have to accept. They were found and fell in love. That this love was against all social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief, that was enough. The reaction of individuals around them is a small fact that they have to accept, suffer, and then can continue with life, life. Very nice.
