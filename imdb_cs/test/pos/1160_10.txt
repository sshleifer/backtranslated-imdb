This is one great movie you'll remember for a long time. It's about history, America, the change of time, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, the kidnapped American and his children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the prophet in the veins. The film is based on a real story - like Jesse James was a banker. The American was kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines set off to Tripoli to save him. So much for it. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is a Berber chief and Muslim leader. Candice Bergan is a guy who was kidnapped along with his two kids; son is Rex Harrison's grandson, Simon. John Huston is Foreign Minister, with a great John-Huston-style straight line at the State Dinner, watch out for it. Brian Kieth JE Teddy Roosevelt, an all-American, all-man, character who is an interesting commentary as modern as today. The action and beauty of the desert and Morocco are beautifully portrayed in cinematography in this film that will remain with you, a haunted and persuasive memory. The score is as extensive and exotic as the images. This is a story about two cultures, both with great ideas and historical past, fighting for the future without mutual thought. In any case, the fight descends to a level versus ingenuity. Then there is a little boy at the end - remember a little boy? What do you think he thinks, right?
