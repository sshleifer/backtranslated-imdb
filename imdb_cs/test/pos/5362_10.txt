This is the type of film they used, fun, warm-hearted, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances of people without a nose, jobs, jobs, eye work, in other words real people. Shauna MacDonald plays a woman's interest in love, and she's so real that you want to cuddle her at least. Imagine, the real girl in the movie, what next? Hollywood will hate her because her freshness is a sharp reproach for every fake star in Tinseltown. This story has the same cheerful feeling as the classic "Whiskey Galore" by Sandy Mackendrick, with the gnomic humor of distant Scottish islanders who are prejudices of intruders from the outside and from time to time enjoying drama with time. short). Director Stephen Whittaker portrays a rare skill when he pulls it away, and is shocked to find that he died just 56 years before he released his film. Ulrich Thomsen is doing very well to play a German rocket scientist who in the late 1930s goes to Scarp on the Isle of Harris to build a small rocket carrying postal packages between the islands. There he falls in love with the tempting Macdonald's girl and she pays back her affection. The story is decorated with some beautifully colored local characters and the film is pure pleasure. Of course there is a looming war with Hitler and we find out that Hitler carried out 1000 rocket scientists who refused to build war weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from sight, but lips must remain sealed in a review of what happens in the end. This film is a great example of movies that people in Britain should do. But are they properly released? In a nation whose taste has been so damaged by the reality of TV shows where repulsive nonentities have become national heroes, is there still a market for such a film? After all, there is no grunting sex, there are no detailed shots of purulent wounds or genitalia of anyone, there are no drugs, there are no mindless celebrities hovering around who want to be seen, so one asks whether there is something interested in the public it has become so decadent and tired that only those extreme feelings can shorten the boredom of their senseless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the present-day emptiness of Britain can resort to this refreshing and honest film.
