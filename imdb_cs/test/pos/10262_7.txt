Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD-label that specializes in sadness and too violent cult movies? mostly Italian - from glorious times when everything was possible, from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. Selecting a label seems like a switch between "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably even borrowed a second name) and released some really rare sick Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer", "Killer Nun", " Phantom of Death "and" Torso ". The "frightened woman" was totally unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around the world, whose opinions I greatly appreciated, described it as one of the biggest and most interesting psychedelic films of euro-sexploitation of my time, I did not hesitate to pick it up. This is a very strange movie and probably not suitable for about 99% of average movie lovers. If you are part of this remaining 1%, but you are for a truly unique gift. Style, atmosphere and content are similar to "Succubus" Jessy Franco and "Venus in Furs" by Massimo Dallaman, but both are considered classics, while "The Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all a question of profiling and good marketing. The story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns more ancient cars and has a very impressive collection of art relics including a life-size replica of a doll dummy) with a bizarre and slightly unconventional attitude towards women. He sees them as a threat to the survival of the male race, and therefore spends his days kidnapping, humiliating, and sexually abusing a random person he raises from the street. Dr. Then Sayer kidnaps the ambitious journalist Maria, with the intention of crushing her feminine spirit completely, but it falls slowly on her. Only he begins to believe in real love, she strikes with revenge. This really isn't for everyone, but if you can appreciate the whimsical and ominously sexy ambiance, bizarre scenery of toys and psychedelic touches that seem totally unlikely and surreal, you might consider one of the best recommendations. Is it slow, stylishly slim and totally blind? Shameless fun, all right!
