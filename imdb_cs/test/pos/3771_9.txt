That's one of those rare comedies where you can, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh aloud. Powerful performance as Hyde is a purely manic genius. See if you can keep your face straight while doing your transformation. Good luck. :) On the other hand, there are times when the movie is deafening. It looked more than 90 minutes.
