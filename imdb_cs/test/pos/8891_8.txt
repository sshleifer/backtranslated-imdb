Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: His wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left it, he has a new budding romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), doesn't know how to start his book and his students class his writing The screen is alien than most others. But one student (Danny DeVito) is special. He lives with his evil Momma (Anne Ramsey) and can't get the courage to kill her. So before he goes to Larry for help, his life goes from normal madness to being crazy! Stu Silver should do more! Dialog, characters, whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito proved to me to be more than a great actor: he's a great director! His childhood film Matilda is one of my favorite family films, and now it's one of my favorite comedies. It's a black comedy, most of the jokes are about murder, but it's fucking funny! All actors make their full potential, whether they are the main characters (Billy Crystal) or just single-subject minor characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (Who's Not?) before you like it! 8/10 stars.
