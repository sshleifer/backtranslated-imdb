This film has a very deep view of the relationship between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that the look is everything. She and her son, who recently returned from Vietnam, will collide on some very tight questions. Relationship is not intimate, and it is a very accurate representation of what it is to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of problems. Kathy Bates has a great job of portraying a woman of false faith that is either oblivious to her cruelty, oblivion or simply not being confronted. Jeremy's anger is never afraid and leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers who love him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event that leads to despair.
