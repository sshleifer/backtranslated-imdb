The Beatles have just made a 'Magical Mystery Tour'. There was a general feeling that performance, peace and drugs went naturally. There was a film subculture in LA that knew something was up. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. Before deciding to become a serious actor, before 'Easy Rider' before 'Pink Flamingos' before 'Day for Night', there were several experiments with what was done. Important is the manuscript of Saragossa. That's another. Jack writes. He plays with circular narration, self-reflection, film legacy, self-hate performance, pain in creation, all on the edge of safe childhood. You have to see it, just to know about Jack. Some actors act by kicking themselves. It's a common technique. Some kick deep, but after a while they are bored because they are incredibly shallow. There's not just so many things to keep a career. Think about DeNiro and Hackman. Others are quite interesting people who seem to be more interesting over time. When they plunge into the barrel, they put things back for the pain of digging. You think Sean Penn and Jack. At the end of Jack's keg, spinning at the end of the thread, as the basis of each character is this experimental, risky writer / filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it risked. Watch the tear wipe with director Annette. It's a loving bloody thing about Brando, something I've heard Marlon laughed. This is one of the richest moments in Hollywood movie history. It's another reason to look at it. The music in the movie has a strong dance. The film revolution often relies on music. They will absorb the whole culture. The absurd giant in inventing how he now dances billions is Toni Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as The Beatles were in music. She was already in a good career when she was asked to work on it. But this is one of her earliest shows on the screen. You can see her work all over and she herself in a pretty cool 'Daddy Girl' segment, through one of Nilsson's better songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa's portrait.) McCartney would refer to this scene in his special TeeVee years later. The third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the movie: a character named 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then refuses to turn. She is credited as I. J. Jefferson but is really Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover at the time and LSD partner. Red Hair, Psychedelic Behavior. Charming. The scene tells me everything about how Jack feels about boys. Ted's rating - 3 of 3: It's worth watching.
