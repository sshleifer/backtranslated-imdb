That was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea. However, it was just a little disappointing that 'Twist' was a bit too predictable and just a little too early in the movie. As he watched, it began to be a bit bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable possible outcome was the inevitable conspiracy plot, but it certainly didn't spoil the flow of movies. There were excellent performances, never a dull boring moment, so it's worth watching. I was wondering to the end, and for me there aren't many movies that could do it these days. I highly recommend people watch this amazing little movie.
