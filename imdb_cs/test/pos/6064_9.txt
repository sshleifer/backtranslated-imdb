This is one of the best non-English series I've seen. It weaves interesting single and double crime episodes along with a personal aspect that you simply won't get into CSI. Individual characters have a personal life that combines well with their everyday work and occasionally disturbs them. In addition, the characters evolve naturally during the episodes. Casting is excellent and has been recorded all over Denmark, which is a good example of what a majestic country has to offer. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were produced, but they are high-end television stations. Here it is hoped that they are considering making other episodes of the same caliber.
