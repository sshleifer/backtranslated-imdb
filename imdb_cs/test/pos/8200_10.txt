I read some doubts about court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production went simply amazing to re-create all aspects of the period in which the story appeared. Fair behavior is just a few people out of court. Although acting may seem very stylized, it is actually as close as possible to replicating the behavior of individuals at their particular stations that the director could create. Facial facial expressions are a miracle, especially a duplicate of the Changxin and the king's mother. Of course, in the relationship between the king, his parents and his parents there are reflections of both Greek and Shakespearean tragedy. love. The juxtaposition of a king transforming from good to bad and the killer from bad to good provides many incentives to reflect on the evolution of the individual's nature. This film would provide much to reflect on in the university course on the humanities. At the same time, he is almost in a hurry, even in the slowest scenes leading to a relentless denouement. One suspects the involvement of large parts of the troop movements, which were quite amazing. This makes Lord of the Rings battle scenes pale in comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of people in the battlefield just for art. I remember one scene in which at least 30,000 soldiers can be seen moving across a vast plain. Logistics for such a shot would be overwhelming. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I just can't recommend this movie high enough.
