The journey to the far side of the Sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the Sun that shares the same orbit as the Earth, and has not been discovered until a spacecraft photographed it on the far side of the Sun. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) are sent to investigate them, but because of the breakdown they crash and find themselves on the ground for only three weeks on their six-week journey. Of course, they are excited (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is seriously injured) and grilled and asked why they turned to their mission, but they say no. Until Thinnes sees some very strange things about going home. This is great if it's somewhat talky at times, and the files and feelings aren't far from "Thunderbirds" territory, but they will live actors once. It's not a big star war production, but a quieter sci-fi that one has to think a little. It is worth seeing and it is punishable that the DVD is out of print. 8 out of 10.
