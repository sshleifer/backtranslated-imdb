I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best movies I've seen. It was very well directed and the acting was excellent, very convincing. The music was good and the film was beautifully shot. Take the hopelessness out of the Requiem for a dream and unnecessarily. An excellent depiction of the world of drug addiction and its consequences, which are given in a very open way that anyone can relate to. cudos to mtv for giving us a good movie to change from! * $ *% as Crossroads.
