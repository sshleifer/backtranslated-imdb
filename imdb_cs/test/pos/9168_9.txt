As I said in the title of this review, it bothers me when I say it, but the "snag" reaches the zenith of what Hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope to aspire to. I was a critic of both genres and it's a namesake as long as I remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, "Hitch" caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile plastered by my face. This film may in some cases be misogynistic and occasional, but it still has some humor whose subtlety can only be described as British. It's an amazing attempt by Hollywood to make (or possibly a remake ...) a movie that appeals to all our wishes for a romantic comedy that can both think and laugh at the same time. Reluctantly and most evasively, I give this movie 9 out of 10 ... Something I can hardly see in the near future for a romantic comedy or something, I hope.
