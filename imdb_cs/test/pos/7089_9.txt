"One True Thing" is a kind of movie where the audience is inspired by very strong inspiration. I'm not necessarily saying that the movie is uplifting because it's not. In fact, the film is depressed on the right. I try to say that it takes a lot to make the film create emotional tears from the crowd present. strong films from 1998. The figures were perfectly cast. The performances are all guaranteed Oscar nominations, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays the dying Kate very well. Her acting alone was enough to make the film stand out in the recommendation, giving you a new look at it. I also thought Renee Zellweger portrayed a realistic free woman who had to take care of her own mother. Other cast members including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott were also excellent. The screenplay of this movie was really fantastic. It's a bit funny how the movie concept is related to the controversial events in my local area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now there's a big problem with assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkian (excuse me if so) for the ways they were just banned. The public will vote on it in November. After watching "One True Thing", she changed my mind on the subject, even though I always believed it. Without revealing the end of the movie, I will just say that suicide is a remote theme in this movie and I think it fits perfectly into a beautiful story. Overall, this film has a more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Saving Private Ryan" or another tearjerker released in the last few years. I think it's because the main idea of ​​this movie is that it happened every day, so it's better for the audience. And that could happen to you.
