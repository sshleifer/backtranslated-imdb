When I first saw this film in mid-January (2005), I didn't like it. I thought it was too strange and I thought some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted on were unlike her. (Which is, of course, true) And then the next day I looked at the pieces when I was sending it again and I felt almost the same. Then I saw it again two Sunday (March 20, 2005) and I really enjoyed it and this time I recorded the whole thing. I even cried the first two times, but mainly because the actress was really crying and I was her big fan. <br /> <br /> It's a very well-functioning and finished TV movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she has a great job in this movie! I'm still watching it. It's a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it! It's not usually my type of movie, but I enjoyed it! A +++
