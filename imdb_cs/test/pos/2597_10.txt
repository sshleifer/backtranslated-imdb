There's only one movie I think might be as good or better than this one when it comes to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, the determination that is best is irrelevant - just watch both and enjoy. I compared it with ALI BABA BUNNY because they both have Daffy in his worst - greedy, ugly and very funny process. However, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because the mistakes are also pretty horrible - doing terrible things to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. The film starts Daffy leaving the rabbit tracks right into the Bugs hole in the hope that the hunter (naturally Elmer) will throw the rabbit away and leave Daffy alone! Not to be exaggerated, Bugs takes all Daffy's tricks over and over and turns them - and in most cases it includes Daffy getting in the face! It's all very, very clever and funny and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh if you don't grouch. I especially love the great and unexpected end, but I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the surprise.
