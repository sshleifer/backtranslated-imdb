Before I talk about the end of this movie, I'll talk about the plot. Some guy named Gerald breaks his engagement with Kitty and runs to Craven Castle in Scotland. After a few months, Kitty and her aunt went to Scotland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty discovers that Gerald has grown old and he has grown. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules were the same for 200 years). Gerald doesn't want them to stay, but Kitty insists she stay by apologizing. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of a monster running through the hallway. It scares her so much that she faints and (another apology) must stay longer. Kitty is increasingly worried about Gerald when he tries to go into the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even smaller for her. Kitty then sends to reinforcements, calling his doctor, who is actually their friend and his wide. Then, to make things look suspicious, they invite a few other friends (who don't really do anything). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt will end up in a maze where the story's greatest tension. Somehow they separate themselves and try to find each other. But the aunt comes across a creature ... here's the moment we've all been waiting for, lurking creatures in the shadows? ... it's a huge FROG !!! OMG what's better than that! After seeing my aunt, the frog was literally crazy and running, I think hop hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then jumps out of the open window. Then we go to the ground and see the frog to us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what's funny is a frog that falls out of the window is actually a toy because it's a 1/10 size frog before it takes a jump. It is then revealed that this was all evolution error, bla, bla and Kitty and Gerald marries. The last picture of this masterpiece is from the grave's grave in the maze, the only place where he was really happy;).
