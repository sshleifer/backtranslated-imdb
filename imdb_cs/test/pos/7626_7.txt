I was 9 when I first saw it on TV. on Friday evening. I remember the entire page of the ad in the Rex Image Guide. amazing how some things stay in your mind after 30 years. By the way, if your kid who likes monster movies this one is fun enough, especially with boone and keats raging at each other. Special effects are not harryhausen, but its value in an hour and a half if you find them somewhere in late night television. I haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade out of cable TV. If you catch it late at night, don't be too critical, just take some refreshment and enjoy it. it might be Syrian, but I thought it was a lot better than a konga remake that came out in theaters a year ago.
