Trilogy is very interesting. Some go out with a bang (The Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (Matrix), some lose in the dark (Blade, Back to the Future), but some keep the genius, a seemingly growing bright light, floats above the flawless surface exterior. Case and Point: "Trilogy Trilogy". This chapter in the last trilogy is most philosophical and provocative. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, more figure driven plot, in "White" it was a rather light heart, a story-driven story where we listened to more of what characters say than anything. "Red", however, is centered on "what if" and "how comes". It challenges our own destiny and focuses primarily on the past and the future rather than the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model that runs through a dog and brings it back to its owner. He soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who has tried his neighbor's phone calls through advanced spy equipment. All three trilogy films have very basic lines, but they bring a lot more to the story. Consider the "Blue" story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly portraying ideas about contemporary French society and how it reflects the character's behavior. "Red" is not just about a young woman who takes refuge in an elderly man's life, but also about a chance, hope and fate. Irene Jacob performs as Valentine's Day Dussaut, who at first glance finds an old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find a name, extremely confident and disgusting. Although through his own reflexive analysis and his voyeuristic intentions, he learns that a judge would be the perfect man for her if he were 40 years younger. Irene lives opposite another younger judge, who is very similar to an old man. This is "what if" that is still circling in the movie. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would be her perfect match. But what if a younger judge is actually her perfect match, because she is very similar to an older one. Valentine doesn't know, we just do it, and Krzysztof Kieslowski quietly suggests it in almost all the frames in which Irene is. We are constantly thrown into his face by his presence, like almost Irene's fate. I mentioned that the old man had no name for some reason. The reason is that it is very symbolic for the overall theme in the story. We compare the old judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, more than one way. We learned that the old man once had someone he loved but left. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken because his life's love goes with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine ever meets this man. Even if they go through each other without noticing every day. There is also a phone theme, for Valentine's Day it's a way to keep healthy and update your life, at Auguste's that's what leads to his heart, and to an old man, he's the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shade the characters of their own psychology. It's a statement about what they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" films represent a principle, most common in France. "Blue" means Liberty (personal being), "White" means Equality (being received more than one), and "red" is fraternity (to socialization, learning). And while this last chapter is a clear focus on the principle of fraternity, Kieslowski will make sure that the other two also bring together the three stories. For example, we see an old man trying to reach out to Valentine's Day and illuminate him with his spy equipment, which reflects the principle of equality. Also, at the end, we see that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that he is more about himself than others (not answering the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles, Kieslowski nicely combines all the characters, even in the final and most sensitive scene. "Red" is about where you could be if you were older or younger. The point is whether someone is absolutely perfect for everyone, and whether one can change your life. The final chapter of the most noble trilogy she has ever shot breaks the barriers in direction and narration. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern age. And while the film is somewhat more subtle than the film "Blue" and "White", it boldly shouts a declaration of love and compassion. It's hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last film, and that died at a young age. However, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember his work, which belongs to Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you missed!
