"Black Water" is one of the most tense movies I've seen for a long time. The story moves quickly as it follows three hikers (all great actors) into a swamp tour with a butch guide on a small boat. Soon after the fall of the anchor in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they are inverted by something huge in the water. Hastily, three succeed in getting into a tall tree nearby as they realize that the crocodile has invaded them. Over the next two days, he must desperately try to escape the evil attentive eye of a crocodile, and he does not seem to want to leave. The film is only a bit short, but what can you expect from a setup and a limited budget? It's much better than "Primeval" and other recent crocodile / underwater thrillers. Voltage is heavy and all three wires provide amazing performance. Really cool, this film struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on real events.
