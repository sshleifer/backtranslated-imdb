I confess that I am astonished at the sea and have spent several years in the Navy, so I'm a little biased about this. I missed this document when it first came out, but it bothered different people to buy it for me on Christmas (2002) on DVD and I got it! Some of the movies are amazing and I have great respect for those who do these kinds of documents, seeing 200 tons of Blue Whales 'cruising' across the sea is an incredible sight, looking like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed by narration, it's okay, I don't want to know the burden of science just some of the basics, seeing these things is sufficient for most people. The BBC has the talent to put things right for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A really great documentary, there with 'World at War for Me', DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a little criticism, it would be some apparently added sound effects here and there, I think some scenes are making it light. But well done by BBC and Discovery.
