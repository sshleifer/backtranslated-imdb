The musical bios are cut from the same fabric. Hopeful fighting, succeeding and finally winning the girl, but this - the life of the Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - goes beyond the usual traps. He has a great charm and great sincerity and everyone cares for him beautifully. Dennis Morgan is in the lead, as is Arlene Dahl. Andrea King's supportive performance as Lillian Russell is much better than Alice Faye's powerful bio performance in her career. William Frawley touches like an aging tenor William Scanlon and Sara Allgood is beautiful as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend good support. There are more than 25 songs (real treasure chest): Come down to my evening; Blue eyes Nellie; Tell me your dream; Wait for the sun to shine, Nellie; Will you love in December?; The Light of the Silver Moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss Linda Lou; If I dreamed; Wee Rose of Killarney; Shake hands; One little girl; Little piece of heaven; Bier; Sweet Innescarren; Cozy Um; When Irish eyes smile; Mother Machree; Fair Kerey; Peace in my heart; My Wild Irish Rose. Although the film won only nom-for Scoring - and deservedly, it also earned a nod at Art Direction and costume design - sumptuous and beautiful at Technicolor. The reasons why it's not on video may be due to the great amount of time spent in the atmosphere of the Minstrel Show - at least a quarter of the film - with a lot of material quite INRORECT for today's audience. It's historically accurate, however. This is a real gem and worth looking for. He leaves one with a warm glow.
