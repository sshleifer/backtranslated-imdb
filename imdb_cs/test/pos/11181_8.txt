Unfortunately, since I couldn't find them anywhere, I didn't try any other recordings in the series, even though I didn't mind and believe me, I looked. For anyone who doesn't know, it's a point-and-click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to connect with everything you can do, although in this case there is one particular case where it is inaccurate. I don't want to spoil it here, for anyone who hasn't tried it yet. However, no matter how little experience you have with your computer, you can sit down and try it. There is not even so many pieces of this place where you have to be quick or have quick reflexes. Damn, you can set the speed of the text (if you have captions on), and thus speaking in it, and it's not extremely embarrassing or forced when slow. Accessing inventory is easy, as well as combining or using items. Clicking and holding the button on anything you can influence gives you three options for using it (whether it's a person, a particular part of the neighborhood or an object): Hand (push, pick up, open, etc.), eyes ( research, look, etc.) and mouth (eat, converse, etc.). All of this adds to a pleasant and friendly environment where you can access rich riddles (varying according to which of these two difficulty settings you try) at your own pace and explore and accept dozens of individual, creatively executed characters and areas in this content your heart. The length of this will be determined by how much time you have to do so (you don't hear any guilt from me, worth it) and your skills in finding a solution. There are a few points in this where you get to decide whether you want a tougher way to finish or not. Anyone of any age can enjoy it. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. This is one of the products that help prove that this does not mean that it is unbearable for an older audience. Animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the third dimension is not honestly what is lost when trying to do this. Storytelling is well done and you are never unclear about what is happening. There are many well-managed scenes that are kept in the same color, mostly bright 2D world as others, with well-executed camera movement. "Cartoony" is a good word for describing this and not just the visual style. This can be applied to all this. The whole world of this is very similar, but not exactly the same as ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can recognize or understand at least parts, but absurdity. makes them funny. That would have to be one of the greatest strengths, here: It's merry. Much of it comes from spoken lines (as is being said), and those who exploit British efforts to focus on verbal, such as 'Allo' Allo or BlackAdder franchise, will want to check this sprout. However, there are several different kinds of jokes, including but not limited to the following: Satire, cleverness, dark, spoofs, irony, rough-out comedy (not entirely my favorite aspect of this) and more. There is self-awareness, leadership reaches you personally, and for example, explains why you will not do what you asked him to do. There are references to pop culture over a couple of decades. Almost all of it works, barely any bolts fall flat, and if you're not in this stitch, my best guess is what it would be that it's just not compatible with your sense of humor ... a situation that requires and if anyone has I suspect that this might be the case and I want to find out, I suggest a demo version where you can find out for free whether you care about the game brand and / or laugh. The storyline is well written (almost all of this is, indeed), evolving nicely and keeping your interest well. The sound is excellent, sharp and well executed. Sound effects are direct. Music is well composed without exception. Voice gaming is perfect, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (he must love this name) you control. Boen is incredible as LeChuck, a deceased (and still imminent) zombie villain. The designs are extremely well executed, highly imaginative and appropriate. Despite the relatively limited availability of our hero in terms of piracy, you can join some. Drive the ship, deck the others, and match the blades in a somewhat unique and wonderfully thoughtful way. Re-gameplay lies mainly in the election, during the dialogue etc. It is linear, with tad freedom in terms of ranking, so the buccaneer sit with this, at least a second time, does not have so many options when it comes to this question if he forgets what he has to do in the meantime. Nothing is perfect. Anyone who would like to dive into a thoroughly elaborate and fascinating fictional universe and shatter many times should get a real kick out of it. Good kind, not those that hurt and potentially leave bruises. Remember, kids, don't * eat books ... that's just beg for paper cut. I bet that even those who love others would appreciate it too. And they're not the only ones who can get into it. I recommend it, in addition to the members of the group above, any fan of this VGs genre, as well as anyone who likes this review. 8/10
