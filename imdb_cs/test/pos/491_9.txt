Hi <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles. The movie action sequences are better than the Matrix! Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes of all time. <br /> <br /> If you like action / vampire movies, this is ONE. The <br /> <br /> theme is pretty good given that so many vampire movies have been made before. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the ride.
