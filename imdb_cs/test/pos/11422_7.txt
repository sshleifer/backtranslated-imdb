This short comedy Stan Laurel is a cute parody of Valentino BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably appreciate this movie and laugh at several scenes that ridicule Valentino. However, if you haven't seen the movie and are just watching this movie, you probably won't be overwhelmed - even though I liked the cover card, the word "bull" has been used repeatedly in a fun way. > <br /> "Vaselino" is a bullfighter who seems to be weak enough to win just because the bulls seem lazy and non-aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the movie, which allegedly killed ten men, is apparently just a domesticated bull. It's not a great movie that would be imagination in every way, but cute and harmless movie.
