For me, a tenfold film is one that will never die in my memory, yet it can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This may be a technically flawed film; pleasure has nothing to do with spitting-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, at least!). John The Carpenter "The Thing" is one of the few films that fit this criterion. I was a science fiction fan because I was a child in the sixties, and I read a short John W Campbell. The story on which the film is based ("Who's Going There") before I saw the original Howard Hawks black-and-white movie (as with many people that watching was illegal, on TV when I was supposed to be in bed!). The film, like so many you see as a child under such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the tension, the inexplicable nature of the stranger, the photograph; it all seemed to work. I've been watching it many times in the coming years (and still doing it when it's shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - when I thought the remake of a favorite movie was always a mistake. When I ever watched it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV, because there was nothing else I realized I had to change "always a mistake" to "usually a mistake"! The carpenter made something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and really fabulous. From the introductory scene of the helicopter and the husky, through the viscerally disturbing dog pound scene to this end (sorry, no spoilers here!) I was addicted. The soundtrack itself lives with me - all I have to hear is a close resemblance to the bass bass over the drum, and I'm * in the last scene again ... <br /> <br /> Until I saw "The Thing ", I had Carpenter as another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since I've seen "The Thing", I think I've seen most of his movies - I didn't get out of it, but when someone comes in, it's enough to see his name as a director. it. He is thoughtful and knows how to make a movie to reach a point where something will be kept in mind. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen "The Thing" and you like fiction science, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, cover yourself up and prepare for your memory!
