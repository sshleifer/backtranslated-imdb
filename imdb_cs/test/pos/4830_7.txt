This is the biggest surprise of the festival so far and undoubtedly the best of the festival. I went to this film with little to no expectation after I learned that the director was responsible for the terrible vampire movie The Forsaken. and I was pleasantly surprised. The film plays Lori as she looks at In Crowd's fame as a young mother whose husband just passed. She moves to an old family house in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is the grave of overworked children on the day. It is unfortunate that children will return with vengeance that kills and eats everyone on their way. The film works on many levels. It's well done, tense, has good cinematography, and is capable of performing mainly Compton. The atmosphere is scary, but somewhat overwhelming, the score is decent and make-up effects are terrible and simplistic. The film maintains a haunted and disturbing tone, and the children themselves with pale skin, torn lips and hollow eyes are quite scary and unrelenting. The film is original and inventive without being artistic or complicated. I don't see this movie that gets into a wide edition without any trimming and fine tuning. But they definitely have a good product on their hands and should watch some kind of theater distribution. But the theater in which I saw it was terrible. The sound was terribly confused, which I felt as I moved away from the film and stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on a screen that killed a bit of mood. All in all, although it was the most satisfying of the horrorfests of records perhaps because he had the least expectations, he was nevertheless a welcome addition to the genre films.
