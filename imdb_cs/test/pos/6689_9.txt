Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, perhaps the greatest. That, combined with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, can't be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. To start the movie with a brilliantly written story. It's part of what makes the movie so great. Another aspect that contributes to film size is acting. The combination of Spacey-Bridges really works. It was the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it won't be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others that resemble a first-class drama. I think this film deserves a much higher rating and much more awards. Great movie! 9/10
