"Meatballs" is an summer camp camp. Those of us who have reached the camp will see many scenes as we remember or wish them to be. Bill Murray plays Senior Advisor Tripper Harrison, who really runs the camp. It reminds us of a funny super employee that everyone loves. Young campers are attracted to him and if they talk to you, you feel like you are a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. It controls a movie with its one liner and ad-libs. Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, a reclusive caravan who gets under the Tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell. The rest of the filmmakers and staff was also excellent. The overall theme of the film is a loser who overcomes the obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to camp and even to Tripper, there are those who are movie stars, stars. The movie has a heart. The movie is fun and funny without being cruel or excessive because some teen movies are today. The cast looks and works like real people. The comedy and the heart draw you to the point that, in the end, just like in the camp, you're sad to leave. In my summer camp, we were supposed to fly underwear, mysterious flesh, try to slip into the girls' cab, crazy stories with hooks around the campfire, and moving sleeping people out of the cabins elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated camp that led us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is overnight when canoes across the lake sing a goofy song. One line that catches me every time when Tripper announces the evening holiday in the evening before Parent's Day and ends "Tomorrow's Parent's Day, and you must look relaxed or Morty will be sent to the state prison."
