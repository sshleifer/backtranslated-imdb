That's the best movie ever, but that's my opinion. Some say it's cheese, but I think it's a really beautiful movie. Chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've ever seen, and that's what makes the film so perfect. I've always wondered what this movie would be if these two actors never existed, because not just one of them did it for me, they both did. If you've never seen this movie before you understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing seems to have been done from the heart and for some reason it's as real as magic and the LOVE IT soundtrack. In addition to the two leading actors, the soundtrack is the beauty it is. How can you say I'm in love with this movie and I know you'll be too.
