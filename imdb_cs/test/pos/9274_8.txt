I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato dabbled in everything from horror to apocalyptic to hardcore porn. He has touched geniuses several times with movies like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This document is a guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewing all over with English subtitles rolling at the bottom of the screen. Excerpts from his films tell the narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary was extremely interesting when he analyzed the often censored "Emmanuelle In America". Here D'amato explains in detail the false "snuff" scenes and recalls some funny stories. In fact, good ol 'Joe is very warm and funny throughout, always wearing a smile and smoking cigarettes. The only unsatisfactory aspect of this document is that they spend little time on D'amato Horror movies like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. He spends too much time on an erotic cinema and hardly touches on post-apocalyptic films. But I can't complain. It's amazing to see how D'amato gets the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for D'amato fans. Let him rest in peace.
