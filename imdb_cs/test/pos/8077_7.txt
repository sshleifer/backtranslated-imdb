So forgive the * really * lame game-play scene, cardboard background and studio as a stadium. For this part I should give movie 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> Assuming that the fence is a lot of resemblance to "The Replacements". Some say that this film will tear "The Replacements" while some say it wrote this script in front of it. <br /> <br /> Both movies require some "suspension of mistrust in the basic premise, and it is especially difficult for" Second String "because the NFL has a licensing team and all the history behind it. to mention in "Second String" Bills must overcome big scores over and over, with a budget limit when shooting game scene games to make it look even worse. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements", the premise and league is fictional, but you know it happened in real life. I think it's easier to take a fictional story and set it up with a real event ("oh yeah, that happened sooner!" How Bill Can Win a Superbowl! "; some scenes were actually filming in pre-season Raven games, a real stadium, a real audience and some NFL match similar to the shooting angle. br /> <br /> But let's say both movies they came out the same day, and we erase the budget factor (hence the forg.) ive the game to play the action scene): Overall, I like "Second String" through "Replacements", not much, but I like it more. <br /> <br /> Has a "relatively better" character development. In "Replacements", Keanu's character is too "out of sync with the world", and all he cares about is maybe getting a girl? In the second chain, you see the QB struggle from getting the job back and dealing with its past with the coach. Or fumble guy problem. Of course, this "hold the ball all day" solution is not new, but we see a procedure to correct it. <br /> <br /> What about these trick games? I think it's "relatively realistic" than "replacing". "Dan Marino" like a fake knee passage, flea flicker, wild cat full back rush, all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy. But for me it's better than a "spare" centered catch and rushing for 50 yards of calling, or as a 60 yard field goal look too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they didn't force the TE kicker out of his shot .... Of course - if you objectively review this movie through other football movies, it could easily be 5 out of 10 movie. But some say it's a worse football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
