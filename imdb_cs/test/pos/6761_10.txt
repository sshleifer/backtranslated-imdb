This movie is the funniest Danish movie I've ever seen! The storyline is funny, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is unlike others, and it gets you every time. The whole audience was laughing at 90% of the time ... it was incredible. The characters are so well played and both actors, Mads mikkelsen and Nikolai Lie Kaas, play their best results! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend that I play this movie, you won't regret it, believe me: -)
