I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far behind my bedtime. A comparison with Hitchcock deserves - this thing is really playing with you. He travels through a beautiful line between real, instant tension and dark, distance humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our unconscious mute witness has innocently hit something really terrible - and we're taking a pretty quick ride with her, alternating with the utter sense of her fear, turning in a thrilling tension when she's. further threatened. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers work with great care. Right from the initial shots, they are challenging you to determine what is real and what is fabricated; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. The plot turns unpredictably and turns. Tension is a combination of carefully selected cameraman, images, music - but the easiest EYES of characters who send raw fear directly to you. Warning: There's some scary gore, just like some nudity. Horror scenes are done emotionally, making them more frightening and disturbing than any teen slasher pic. A teen-slasher pic to AIN'T. Characters are unpredictable and feel like real people, for one thing - a couple (including a heroine) can even find you cute as I did. You will have no mistake watching a movie made for adults. Alec Guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't need a job! <br /> <br /> Pop it in the video sometime in the evening when you can't sleep. . . and you don't want it yet.
