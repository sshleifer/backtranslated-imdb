Barely three and a half years after losing a month's run (7-31 October 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (in the west of 49th Street; since then renamed O'Neill), MGM relied on earlier solid success in London richly cast and - for the most part - a carefully "open" production on a sadly cropped scenario of this crafty subversive tabloid comedy and was rewarded with a modest hit. Ava Gardner is Stewart Granger's increasingly frustrated wife, an internationally successful and totally satisfied "workaholic" (before this term was created), using the constantly frustrated David Niven who was trying to revive his husband's passion. When the "second honeymoon" Gardner inveigles Granger voyage leaves the trio (and Granger's dog), which was mined on an island in the south of the sea (there were other survivors? That's for later plot development), Granger continues to manage the world around him - building a big one a hut for himself and his wife and a bit of a title for Niven - or an unclassified male. The core of the real plot of the game gets only halfway through the film when Niven suggests Granger and he alternate as tenants of Little Hut - sharing a single woman on the island, as Granger was willing to share just a few shoes (his ). The reason (which Granger considers his strength) reigns and frustration rules the highest - for a while. David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their named roles of the great wannabe seducer and seducer and Stuart Granger - usually called only to be handsome and masculine in action roles and a special miscast lty (crowded handsome boy like Apollodorus in Shaw CAESAR AND CLEOPATR in 1945) - Gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as a husband who can actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he would again show this amazing urbanita opposite Rex Harrison in Granger's first (and BOTH their last) Broadway engagement in the revival hit Somerset Maugham's CIRCLE which only ended in the death of Harrison. We would be much richer if Granger used these skills more often. As promising it is, it's a very British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950s to say that (unlike the source game) very little sex actually goes on. To be honest, if you don't look at the ideas that drive controversy, it's a little stupid (the same basic plot is much more satisfactorily developed three years later in Cary Grant / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger's real Wife) GRASS IS GREEN, based on an even less successful game, but for some reason the superior trifle has failed at the box office). They were unfortunate blackouts - the stupidity that ends up staying on the island is cartoonishly showing off in what was supposed to be the moment of real excitement - sinking the yacht that gave them to the island. In the end, we only get about three-quarters of the time of Real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger, who make the film a fun distraction. It is not a high culture but worthy of pleasure. Even we have some very nice decoration in Walter Chiari (at that time allegedly Ava is a real lover). One of his better expressions is: "Boola, boola!"
