Critters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist in series, as it takes place in the universe, not in the earthly community. Good effect and acting to make this movie visible. I would recommend it to horror / science fiction fans everywhere. 10 out of 10 Fans of horror movies like this one should look at puppet master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre, and more Full Moon flicks pictures.
