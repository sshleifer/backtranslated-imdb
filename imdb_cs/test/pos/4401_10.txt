I came out of the film Coen before and not quite knowing how to feel. The two best examples of this are Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with a strange humor that I liked. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary respect with flying people and a killer bowling ball that doesn't seem to fit in the form of a movie. Even so, I liked the movie and now I have a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I laughed so hard that it made me cry, but I was still. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further research, there were really real people who talked about real situations. That's why a man with a shovel (or it was a broom) was so crazy funny when he told a police officer about some funny-looking man in a bar. And that's why the theater broke out laughing when he said there were some funny looking clouds coming in. (I also have a copy of this movie) Coen has a way to mask his movie and their characters as somewhat eccentric and maybe a little from the wall. But if you look closely at some of the same characters that seem zany, you'll always find that in some strange way, they all sound. That's what's special about Brother, where are you art? That's the movie that's out there. I think it's not even in the same park as a traditional movie. Last summer I read Shaft and I said Shaft is a good movie I've seen a thousand times before. But you can't say about Coen's brother movie and you definitely can't say that about this. This film has everything in it from jail, crooked southern politics, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside bans, bank robbery, animal violence , singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, crowd lynching and so on. Of course there are many references to Homer's Odyssey, but I wouldn't know, because I never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other journalist seems to know about it and thinks that this cynicism and almost spoofic quality make the film much better. I come from a guy who knows nothing about it, I can tell you it's still a fun movie. There were times when, as usual with Coen, I wasn't sure why I was having fun or laughing, but I was. This is the way three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says hides with his two other cell friends. He must take them with him because they were also attached to him when they had a chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the major actors in the movie and many of them are Coen's friends. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturra who seems to have a place in every Coen movie. It's too bad they haven't found a place for Steve Buscemi, but that's another story together. But back to Clooney. The man has charisma. He's also a hell of an actor, and he's not as zane as the others, but he's got his own idiosyncrasies. His work is quite amazing here and I really hope it will prove that he is able to play any range of character. Now that I have all these praises on the film, let me also tell you. At first I really enjoyed the movie. I found it pretty boring and a little boring. There were too many ideas and it wasn't enough care to use them for everything they needed. But then the film began to grow. It took a while, but it grew on me. I don't think it's their best movie, but it's still good and I give it 8.5. The reason I recommend this movie is for one reason only. Every day you can look at the paper and watch the movies they play and say, you saw them, you saw it, oh, last year, that's the same as this movie and that is the same as the movie. Most of the films were recycled in some form. Not Coen's films. They were not recycled and if I don't know about it. That's why you see something they've interpreted. My books count on originality. Coens are original and good. And that's not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while they can make movies. Because you don't see it like that in many movies, so enjoy it!
