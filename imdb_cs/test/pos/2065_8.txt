There is no cash register success; no one knows why. It could only fail because of its name. It looks like you need a two-word hard-guy title to attract enough of the idiot crowd - "Die Hard", "Deadly Weapon", "Hard Weapon", "Die Deadly", etc. - Talking About "Long Kiss Good Night" But for once Renny Harlin has done a GOOD ACTION movie, much of this is because the central character of Samantha earns our affection and interest soon, and when Charly becomes again, we're torn: we certainly want Charly to thwart the bad guys and everything else, but we don't want her to lose contact with Samantha to do so - even when we love Charly, Geena Davis lends all her considerable charm to both halves of the central character, and Samuel L. Jackson plays a second violin for change. It was a compliment. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, far better than anything in the "Die Hard" series - if I were cynical, I would add: "No wonder it didn't go into Mar ", but I don't feel like this; it's surprising that it didn't work well.
