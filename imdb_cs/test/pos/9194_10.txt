As in "Les amants du Pont-Neuf", two non-members live a love story without concessions. The film consists of lots of interesting conversations and lots of sweet moments. The best one comes in the booth. They listen to the recording together and look at each other once in a while. They talk, they like each other. He suggests a change in his life, but he has no hope. Realistic styles through realistic (but) emotional dialogues. Really mathematical writer work for this movie. Spanish novelist Jesus Ponce is one of the most accomplished galleries of Spanish cinema.
