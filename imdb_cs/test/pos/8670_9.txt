I saw this movie yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. Four months ago I moved to Norway and since then I have been trying to find the origin of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this movie, I was sprained with the brilliant moment of this company. Yes, it's true! I also found a great job with a big salary and I live with my Norwegian friend in a nice apartment in the center. So far, everyone I've met has left me with such a tasty, empty feeling I never had before - that's this movie. Parties with nothing you should not say, but heartless comments, long silence, no stress, creepy calm and frozen smiles. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly portrayed in Den Brysomme mannen. Check out this movie !!!
