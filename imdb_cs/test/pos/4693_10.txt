This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching a movie. It has everything it should: a remarkable scenario, strong characters, beautiful scenery and an exceptional atmosphere. Add some results from Clannad and get an unforgettable picture. I love every HTV adventure movie I've seen: Return to Treasure Island, Smuggler, Adventurer, but Robin of Sherwood will beat them all. I would like to thank the entire HTV production team and especially Richard Carpenter for giving me a lot of adventure and excitement. I have a DVD release in my little movie collection. I'm sorry for very similar movies that aren't made anymore.
