It is a mistake to refer to any movie of this era as a horror movie. Most early German movies with supernatural themes are not so horror movies as they are dark fantasies borrowed from works of early German romantics like E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also in 1921), he portrays the death of a young man from his mistress, but in Lang's film the character's fate cannot be tempered by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but are determined by circumstances to reconcile themselves only in death. But Victor Seastrom's "Corkarlene" repentance is always an option. Fate can be changed - and death postponed - through the choice of characters. Although Phantom Carriage scenes are truly frightening, these terrible images of Death as a great lion are compromised by the offer of Death to be paid to the true monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunk who, due to perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional suffering everyone with whom he comes into contact. One New Year's Eve Holm is hit in battle with a drinking companion. As the first person to die at midnight, Holm must become a Phantom Carriage driver and collect souls during the New Year. Phantom Carriage, driven by an old friendship that began with Holm on the road to destruction, comes to his soul and takes him on his own journey of discovery. On the way, Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him. Perhaps my disappointment at the end of the film is a critique of Selma Lagerl√∂f's novel on which the film is based. However, I would rather see David Holm not be able to escape his fate, and seeing his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning her two children and herself and seeing that Holm suffers the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls. It would be an appropriate punishment and a horror that would be more immense than a testimony of abuse that it caused to others. However, in the film, the immutable nature of fate is not a message; redemption is. The carriage driver allows Holm's spirit to return to his body. His repentance makes Scrooge's repentance in "Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> There's still a lot of admiration in the film's pictures if the tricky and sentimental ending doesn't hurt you. Special effects are amazing when the standards of the day are measured and still sticking, which is more miraculous when you realize that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera. Also, the restored film on the new Tartan DVD looks wonderful.
