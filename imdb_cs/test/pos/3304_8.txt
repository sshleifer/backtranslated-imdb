A funny bad movie that should be entertained. One of Joan Crawford's latest performances as a successful editor vs. all the young beautiful eager beavers fresh from the elite Seven Sister Colleges. Great '50' New York atmosphere. Beautiful period costumes and hairstyles. Amazing direction of art. Trite the story, but screaming tearjerker. An interesting portrait of Robert Evans as a rich cad.
