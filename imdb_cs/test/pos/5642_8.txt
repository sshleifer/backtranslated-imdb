The fires of Kon Ichikawa, written by Shohei Ook and Natto Wadou, are a film of World War II that does not show allies fighting against axial forces, but Japanese fighting and fighting for life in the Philippines. The main character's name is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick. All he has is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. That's how he tries to get to the hospital to get a doctor and a cure for his illness. But since the hospital has turned him away and destroyed him, a long walk begins. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a bit of a coward, but very civil when other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for surviving Tamura's still staying human and would. The scene that has influenced me a lot to think about this war movie positively and differently is when Tamura comes to Phillipino, a village that is completely abandoned. There he fights the dog and finds many corpses of Japanese soldiers stacked in front of the church. That's what makes Tamuru, and even more afraid than he is. This shows that a soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant of higher beings and a man most important. After turning away from the corpses, two Phillipinos (pair or brother and sister: very close relationship) return to the village to regain their salt reserves. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, even though he comes with a gun to them, but shoots a woman as soon as he starts screaming. Her brother / boyfriend then runs away in fear and after a while Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Philippines. He won't hit him. After Tamura picks up a bag of salt, something very rare, releases her gun into the river. This gesture is very important to understand Tamuho's profiling and war in Kon Ichikawa's / Shohei Ooka. Comparing this film with other World War II films is not typical at all. Of course all movies suffer from heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. It expresses everything that is human: it is manipulated, it is weak, it gets fear, it has hope. This is typical for Japanese films of World War II and for Japanese society. Since World War II, the issue is not discussed in Japanese society, the Japanese will probably put the Japanese in the role of victims in World War II. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, another that accumulates the bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church, and another important thing is when Japanese soldiers try to cross the street and Americans are waiting and firing all Japanese soldiers who have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no medical equipment or anything similar. In my personal conclusion, I have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see the film from the other side than usual. It also has no nationalist propaganda that could be easily built. When you watch the movie, you'll be able to see the horrors of World War II in full.
