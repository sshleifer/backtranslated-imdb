You can't watch this movie on a history lesson. That was the first thing I heard about Ma Barker saga, but almost immediately I found out the facts were gone. And with a little internet research, I realized I was, of course, right. Ma Barker is sure that the hell is not the sexy, computational woman the film portrays to her, and apparently did not arrange all the plans for bank theft, kiddnappings, and murders that her criminal boys did. But don't expect a brilliant criminal drama. The screenplay and acting are adequate, the shootings are excessive and mostly unrealistic and there is a very ridiculous scene of slowed death. So why did I give him 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was damn funny. Shooting is fun to watch, but there are some deeper topics among them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation among its cast of alpha males, each with its own program. And I appreciate the minimal use of oath for this period. The pieces are great, reproducing the convincing era of the 1930s. So watch this movie as if you were an iconic film, and take excessive bloodiness and ruthlessness in step with the cheesy ultra serious commentary of an FBI man who wants to take Barkers at all costs. Inotherwords, don't take it too seriously, just have fun with it. And if you like it, you'll love Serial Mom.
