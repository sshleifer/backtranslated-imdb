The basic message - which Miller would have intended after seeing Vichy's war crimes - is that hatred for someone without a rational foundation is a waste of life. The meat character, Fred, knows Lawrence for many years, and yet, when the time comes, at the offer of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. For me, this is a key message - no matter what Lawrence and his wife are doing from now on - they are labeled and have a chance to save themselves with reason. Animal aggression and anger blinded the Union's criminals into reality. My friend suggested I see a "wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without realizing it. I did a role-play experiment once and I was shocked to find out how normal and at the head level people who welcomed the oppressive police state - who would endanger them all - because they crept up. Fred's Beginning, His Friends LA and Preacher Idol are the catalyst that pushes their neighbors to the brink of violence without stopping when they think what they're doing wrong. The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein, a Jewish trader is fascinating, because Lawrence misses a point almost to the end: if the fanatics force Finkelstein out where to go? If his family fled the Nazis, what irony would be bothered in the land of "freedom." The big poster (it's a rather famous propaganda piece) about American families enjoying the highest standard of life in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, watch graffiti on the subway train and all the little posters. This message is also hidden there. This film should be in every school's curriculum, especially in our age, when gratuitous hate is so widely propagated by "reasonable" people who are only extremists in thin disguises.
