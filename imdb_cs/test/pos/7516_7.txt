George Scott spoke for his entire life at Paddy Chayefsky's HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging hospital in the city and middle-aged doctors on the verge of suicide. Alongside Diana Rigg, as a free spirit, he decided to save him from himself. Their dialog cracks, and it is clear that they are created for themselves from the very beginning. But will he save him? Their one sex scene is graphic and unforgettable for their passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is surrounded by a group of agitators who do not want it to be a convicted building for a cancer center. The hospital is a free serial killer who specializes in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the film is directed at Scott. How it should be. What difference is a few years back when this movie was made. 1962 gave us INTERNS, hockey, old-fashioned reworking of DR. KILDARE with terrible acting and cardboard script. Together came 1971 and HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something to change. Monitoring HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how many medical programs such as ST. Otherwise, SCRUBS owes this lasting classic. And if HOSPITAL reminds you of NETWORK, it should. Same scripter.
