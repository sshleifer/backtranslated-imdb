Not only do I consider it the best movie ever made by Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home), but a true tribute to teachers. Despite the incredible chances, Pat Conroy (Voight) has managed to reach out to a group of students and bring them out of the world to basic literacy and awareness. His methods were criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners. Voight has indeed shown that he has a love of teaching and that it is naturally high for him. he did not play his part and I considered him absolutely believable. Voight is Conrack. Besides love for teaching, we also see another important point in this film. It doesn't matter how well you are in your job, if you're a ship on the ship, bureaucrats will get you.
