Three American boys are diving in Europe and are calling to accumulate as many brave stunts and Hot Babe puts as they can, but Andy is looking for true love. He finds this out during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower when he meets and breathtakingly saves suicide and heartfelt beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he reveals lead his friends and his friends to a fast-paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor without seriously engaging or trying to be something other than wildly entertaining. 90 minutes drive. I have seen this film several times and found that it is a much more beneficial experience than the "London" original, even though the two films are so different that it is not fair to compare these two or even consider this sequel.
