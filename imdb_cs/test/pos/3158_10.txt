I like movies that show real people "Americans" and tell the truth. The movie is simple and it seems to be a great thing. He played fine here in Norway (Amazon says it is the US / Canda, but the box says "All Regions." , you see him and you like it or maybe hate him, I'm sorry, but the darlings of Bush, but this movie makes you crazy because it makes sense. it makes more sense in the second viewing, I loved Owen's words, and the poem made me cry.
