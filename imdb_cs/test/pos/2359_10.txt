It looks b grade and you'll probably think there's no reason to rent this movie! But do it! I didn't expect anything from this movie, just something that passed, but I was addicted from the start! Two interesting spaces - robbery went wrong, missing a million dollars and two girls on their way to a new life - How do these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the film is going to make, it will make 180 and you are blown away by big twists in the plot! It has a great but unexpected end, and you didn't want more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it, you won't be disappointed!
