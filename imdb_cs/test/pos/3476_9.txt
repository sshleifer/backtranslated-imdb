Good. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. Real? If not, there are plenty of plot summaries out there, and there is absolutely no reason why we should waste time on any weak attempts made by me to create another. The most amazing aspect of the film is undoubtedly the performance of two young men and a young lady in the lead. Their emotional honesty was as convincing, if not more, than any performances I had seen in recent months. I found myself laughing, screaming and crouching with them, and it says a lot because I am often called a tired and cynical jerk. As expected, the story is full of clich√©s and I suppose it's the Achilles heel of the picture. It's a story we've seen many times; we all know how it will end from the moment he introduces Rory. Although you don't need to know the exact mechanics, you know that there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet romance and a dizzying conclusion. If it wasn't for heavy casting and directing, this movie would be nothing more than a soporious swill that contains 80 percent of the Hallmark Channel program plan.
