This movie might not seem like a lot to some people, but it had everything I was looking for in comedy. there are funny moments accompanied by a moment or two seriously moving scenes, great actors and almost everything that should be a good movie. Despite playing his usual snobbish character, David did this role in an unusual performance that I don't think he would ever cross until he hit Joe's dirt screen. no matter if some people were fans of Chris Farley, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends and I still talk about it ... 11 years later. This movie told me that Chris Farley was a real business. He's the best comedian I've ever seen. according to some, he could be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober and moving or depressing. not the same words, but the message is all that counts. one of the true great actors of our time and one of the real great comedies of all time. along with good acting, good story, cheerful moments, serious scenes that sometimes brought me to tears. This film stands at the top of the horde as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign on the top of the late comedy world late Chris Farley. no actor before or because he captured my interests in the movie because. because no actor before or because he put so much in his movies. This movie is worth the time if you didn't take the time to see it, so the next time you rent a movie.
