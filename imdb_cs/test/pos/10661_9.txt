Eisenstein created the Russian theory of montage and this film is his best example. It took years for someone to use their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). However, the scene of strollers actually demonstrates the discombulated nature of RMT. It is true that like most movies, it takes a long time in some parts, the beauty of the movie is amazing. One of the best quiet movies I've ever seen.
