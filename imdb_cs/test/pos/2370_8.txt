This is a movie that needs to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen if you haven't seen the first two movies, but people who see this movie will probably own a box or at least know someone who does it. And you shouldn't wait for Blade Runner; The movie budget doesn't stretch so much and it's much more fun to drive. The film is basically a science fiction that will be presented in Yokohama (Hong Kong, as is obvious) about the company. where there is an illegal procreation. Sho Aikawa performs a similar role as Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for childbirth controls. Takashi Miike is not the one who would give you all his reasons on a plate, but it can be assumed that the procreation law (forced by giving people a pill) is there because of over population, prolonged life, and so on. Interestingly, the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and a few speak English. People criticized English for wooden, but I found no problems with it. Also, another person has found themes of homosexuality throughout the film to be offensive; said that Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. It can be very good (and not all artists must be leftist), but I do not see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He only calls back the philosophies of ancient Greece when homo or bisexuality was more common. The film features similar proportions of action-packed and annoying moments to DoA 2, although in this film the action is more based on martial arts and is performed in very good Hong Kong style. The movie in the film is very nice in the eyes, with symmetrical shots, good color control to keep the air dirty, and it's nice to see the uncut, long shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there is a lot in this film: a good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It is a great result of the series. Could you criticize it for being a bit cheesy, but isn't that part of the spell?
