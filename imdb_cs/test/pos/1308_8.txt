This movie is called "Junior Pilot" on IMDb, but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Go find out! The film is a pleasure both for the target youth audience and for adults who can pause their maturity so they can watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. For adults, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps trite and melodramatic; whereas the story may seem new and creative to young people who have not seen or read many films or books with such a story line. In any case, filmmakers, especially director James Becket and cameraman Denis Maloney, must be the film's most entertaining and visually interesting film. The shorts of the fantastic ideas of the young protagonists Ricky are cheerful as well as beautifully shot. Young actors make uniformly believable performances, seemingly quite invested in their roles - stupid, how many scenes there are. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" with pretty good camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a wonderfully soft and sensitive "Shashi" that thrives on all the funny things on hot sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley are also performing well. As is typical of his always fine acting performances, Larry Miller creates a solid parenting character that turns the children's part-real, part-fantasy world around. Compared to his paternal figure, the other major adult roles seem shallow and one-dimensional, deliberately and quite witty to be sure. This film is a simplified story focused on youth, of course it's quite fun, perhaps repeatedly, to focus on the youth crowd, but also at least one look at adults who retain the ability to watch such a film from their youthful perspective.
