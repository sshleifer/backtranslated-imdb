Watching on Comcast On-Demand. Every time I see this musical, I am impressed by the songs ... once show-stopper after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is, for me magical. The song sparkles ... vocals, orchestrations and choreographies are amazing for the movie "made-for-TV" ... better than the many versions I've seen. The Bette Just debate doesn't make sense. It's Mamma. Her voice is brilliant yet full of pathos of an ethnic mother living through her daughters. At the end, I still tear when she finally has her moment of fame, no matter how faded the fame is. Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is now. Great. Stephen Sondheim is the King of Music Theater. His lyrics are simply based on a language like silk ... Styne's music is perhaps the best ever written on stage / screen. Thank God we have this masterpiece of American musical theater captured on DVD.
