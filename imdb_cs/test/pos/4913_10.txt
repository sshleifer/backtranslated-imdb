You have to think in the spirit of the last tango in Paris, because the mood and emotions go on the same lines and maintain the same heights - the difference is that in this exceptional, intense and cruel depiction of love among the ruins of Dostoyevsky's dispossessed setting is a gay-subcultural environment - maybe even the one that is set to disappear in time, and not the same arrest but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's own film. The last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in a gay cinema. Talking about pornography or homosexual self-expression lacks the sense and intelligence of this work. This film, though on the first impression seems to take us into a familiar and often depicted gay underworld-street life, then precedes the subvert rules of this genre by exaggerating it to super-real grade. The result is hyper-charged emotional reinforcement - an exceptional strategy that encourages drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This film is going to pull from a high level thanks to the great performances of the actors, especially the young Jean Hugues Anglade and the director. Tour De-cinema Theater. Exceptional in ambition and constant falling into the depths of human emotions. This film, which benefits the gay cinema, conquers this heavy land and makes it its own triumph.
