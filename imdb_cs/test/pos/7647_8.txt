He surprised me. Previously, I read a few reviews that marked him as a good B-class movie and were ready for the worst. Halfway through, I suddenly realized that I was completely wrapped in it and I enjoyed it a lot. There were really tense moments when you sat nervously on the remote control or other object within reach. Overall, this movie definitely does not deserve a class B mark. I hope these guys will continue with larger budgets and studio support.
