**Warning! Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you will see all year long, or probably this summer. But it is worth two hours because the colors in the lines know their limits and do not try to cross them. <br /> <br /> What the film carries is the cast. In a movie about a thief crew, individuals must have a good relationship with each other. Without this coherent feeling, viewers do not believe in characters collectively or individually, and the film never has a chance. But from the first scenes in which men joke around and rag on themselves while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the right chemistry is in place. The characters themselves are nothing new; they are your basic group of criminals, which contains about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill. But every actor brings the right goods to the table for his part. Mark Wahlberg's moderate acting and humor fits well with his role as a master planner. Edward Norton provides a stance and swirls well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the paternal character of the crew and looks like part of a successful and old-fashioned thief who is still mentally sprying. Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much more than their character abilities, but each one keeps them. Statham as a smooth-running driver; Green as a technical hook with a chip on the shoulder; and Def as a demolition man. Charlize Theron slips well in the part that hasn't asked her too much. She is primarily asked to go fast and look good. That makes. None of the characters are so deep or three-dimensional, but in this known kind of film, two dimensions are all needed. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the film has a European feel, namely "The Bourne Identity", partly because it was filmed on site in Venice along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also contributing to the emotion Euro is rhythmic, bouncy music that contributes to the positive nature of the film and complements the casting relationship. The film's appearance is also perfect. The bright colors of all sites increase mood and increase access. Not only does Minis provide a fun chase option, it also works as a necessary plot device. The chart is more or less straightforward. There are several surprises, but they are more rapid-and-smooth-variety turning, as opposed to drop-your-jaw curve hairpin. Even with those movie speed along. As soon as the foundation is laid down by the first act, everything continues. Fortunately, there are no breaks in action for romance, something that film wisely avoid. There are no breaks for "real life" either. The story has its purpose and leads this course without distraction. The lack of character depth prevents "The Italian Job" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the intricate details of robbery planning, such redundancy could drag the speed and quality of the film. <br /> <br /> There are many options I have been thinking about both during and after. But the movie is so funny that I didn't care. In the real world, most of the film might not have been so clean. But "The Italian Job" does not take place in the real world. It occurs in a stylish and light criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is a film in the true sense of the word. He has no Oscar prejudices and no deep moral message. It provides pure escapism fun and makes it pretty good. Bottom Line: Maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far. 7 out of 10.
