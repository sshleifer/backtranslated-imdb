WEEE is still a good fun! As with most of my friends, we've seen this movie on HBO when we were young and we've been looking for a copy of it ever since. When they finally released it again a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie went up well. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you haven't seen MM when you were young, you don't appreciate it today.
