Background Information - Octopussy & Never Say Never Again films were made in the same year 1983, and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond. I've heard a lot of people who say Octopussy's "official movie" is much better. Well, I was just watching Octopussy. Bond goes by plane to 100 miles per hour (impossible - the wind would blow him up), using his feet to force the plane to the ground, and then jump to 60 miles per hour (again impossible - try it) jumping out of the car - ending with a broken body . How is the octopussy scene "good" in any sense? Suddenly, Bond has super-human strength and a titanium body. And does all these stunts at the age of 56? Complete crap. Incredible. Farse. Now let's contrast with the above scene with Connery's "unofficial" Never Say Never Again: It's not the same because of its independent film status (less money). at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. The film begins with Bond, who shows his age (he is 50 years old) and is on recovery. Completely believable. But of course, there is no such thing as "free time" for the world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds himself aiming, even in the hospital. From that moment the story revolves into another adventure, with Bond attempting to find his attempted killers and eventually thwart the attempt to steal nuclear weapons. - Top / Incredible Stunts. This film feels like a natural successor to Connery's latest film, in 1971 the diamonds are forever ... the old style of Bond ... before the franchise was stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
