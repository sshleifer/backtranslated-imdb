It's hard to know what to do with this strange little Aussie crime - on the one hand, it's a nice little movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other hand, it lacks something to ensure that the film never reaches its limit, which holds it only in "interesting" territory. This means that two hands are a well-rendered movie that juggles several stories at once, allowing for a few small peaks of the film, which in turn helps to stop the boring movie. The absurdity of enthusiasts, the strong Australian accents, and the bizarre character of the characters help ensure that the movie will also entertain. The story is based on the story of a young porter who thinks he will go to bigger things after receiving a job from a local king. He didn't; Work just lands him in trouble when he takes a breath to swim and stupidly leaves ten thousand on the beach, which is immediately stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives for shopping. But for our hero everything is not pink. who has to find money or face the consequences ... The film consists of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was back in 1999, as today Heath Ledger is something of a name. However, it does not work too much because its performance is mostly one note variety and does not lead to very convincing leadership. It fits into the movie in being Australian and looking naive; but besides, it's not the best car I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown has the best performance. Maybe he doesn't have much time on the screen, but he steals every scene he is in and he's the one who adds a lot of humor to the movie. However, it has nothing to do with the best sequence that takes place in the form of the most likely bank robbery he ever captured on film. Overall, I can recommend this movie to people who enjoy unpredictable crime films; how strange the richness and the way events turn into bizarre is pleasing; But if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I can't say that two hands will float your ship. It's not necessary to see it, but if it's your thing and you have a chance to see it ... you probably won't regret it.
