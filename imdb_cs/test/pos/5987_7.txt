I was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depths of too many pseudo-serious interracial movies. the race was one problem, yes, but it was so in class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. both characters. Not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I appreciate it!) Filled with sufficient couples who thought they looked good. together.' is all that is needed to make a solid marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to make love scenes appear that would bring a rainbow to any rough day! in other words, a light film that is by no means light!
