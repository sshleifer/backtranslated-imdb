While on the youth forum, I was on the channels until I found Tommy Boy on TBS. Because I've never seen the movie before, I wanted to check it out. My roommate, who already saw it, told me, "This movie is a classic." After seeing the film, I came to the conclusion that she was right. "Tommy Boy" is always fun from start to finish thanks to comedy duo Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a rebellion like a character, a spastic doofus that just floats through life, as if it wasn't important. His ways to stop quickly will soon stop when his father (Brian Dennehy), a rich "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to hit the road to sell enough pads to rescue the company. The main reason for Tommy Boy's work is the humorous performance of the cast leader. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second most entertaining person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe as the villain of a film that is unlucky. Another funny guy is Dan Aykroyd as Ray Zalinsky, known for extraordinare auto parts. Another reason why a movie works is a lot of jokes. Chris Farley has funny grotesque moments and David Spade has funny comments and one-layer games. Gags in the movie (some of them related to deer and bathroom in the plane) laugh ridiculously, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), Bonnie writers and Terry Turner <br /> <br /> (3rd rock from the sun, that 70s show), and the cast. "Tommy Boy" is a really funny movie, though for some unknown reason most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it horrible and rude. (I wonder when they died their sense of humor.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are big comedy fans. Thank you so much, roommate.
