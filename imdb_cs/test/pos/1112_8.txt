We see a person moving from city to "out-back" and changing dramatically - his family is asking, but he is mad. A strange, brilliant movie to screen in Israel. Wonderful places, great actors, a movie that disguises itself as a "thriller", but which is rather a case study of the madness of a lead man. <br /> <br /> The film was beyond the other AICE festival films here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this movie. It's Grand Guignol, a small noira masterpiece. My only criticism that prevents "10" is that sound and music are sometimes powerful. It tends to get into the way of images that speak for themselves.
