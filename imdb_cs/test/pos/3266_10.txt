A refreshing black comedy playing some of Australia's best. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels caught the funny side of the gangsters in London, two hands rips over the underworld Sydney. It wouldn't be so fun if it wasn't so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> Australian classic. If Australia could pull more rabbits like this out of its hat it might actually have a movie industry worth overseeing.
