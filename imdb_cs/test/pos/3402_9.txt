I watched this series on television in 1990 and loved it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got a second a few days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Gosh ... It was hard to sleep with all the thoughts in my mind ... what happened to Madeline and George, etc. Slave problems and civil war always fascinated me (25 year old Finn). Read Slaves in the Family by Edward Ball for those who want to look into the past and try to understand what really happened. I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell for so many people said it's not that good.
