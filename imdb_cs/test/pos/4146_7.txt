Where should I start. I say how great cinematography is. I commend certain scenes that show the directors' creativity. I'll tell you how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are. I should mention that we do not have a cliché scene to watch the Statue of Liberty change. (So ​​far, immigrants looking at the statue from the railing of the ship is a cliché.) Now what is not likeable, two main things, one of them is a modern song and it is not a good thing. > <br /> The second and almost deadly film is boring, moving so slowly that observing the color on the dry would be an improvement. The 118 minute run time is long, yet the movie seems unfinished. There are no scenes of this family in the US. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his brother, I would like to enjoy the scenes of his unnecessary, maybe happy search, instead of other outstretched scenes. The film is almost missing. <br /> <br /> Rating *** (of 4) 81 points (of 100) IMDb 7 (of 10)
