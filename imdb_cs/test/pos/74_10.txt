Darling Lili is fantastic! It's by far my favorite movie! It certainly didn't deserve the bad reviews he received. Julie Andrews, playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt), is the best part of the film. It's fascinating and magnificent! Since Julie Andrews is my favorite actress and singer, I wasn't surprised how stunning she was. This movie is just ... great (I'm running out of adjectives!), It's amazing, amazing, amazing, funny, terribly romantic, sad, and just all that is happening Dame Julie Andrews! his husband, director Blake Edwards. Yeah, Rock Hudson was also cool :) Julie Andrews is a beautiful and beloved singer Lili Smith. Rock Hudson portrayed Major Larabee, who quickly falls to Lili and she with him. But their business was not a coin. The meeting was planned by the German government (I'm not sure if it's exactly what you would say, but you get a point) because warm, happy singer Lili is actually a German spy. Lili is said to seduce Major LArabee to get information on the new Top Secret Opertaion (later known as "Crepe Suzette"). Although Lili is on a solemn mission, she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee), for the true, making her original quest challenging. But Lili stretches and completes the task after finding something that is not really true about Bill. The end will remain unexpressed because it is beautifully distributed. If anything, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie, I definitely did !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
