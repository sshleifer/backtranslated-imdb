Dracula comes at the end of the Universal Monsters horror movie cycle and before the Golden Age of sci-fi films. It's more sci-fi than horror and includes some of the more cheesy (reading: fun) elements that would come to typify the sci-fi movies of the upcoming era. Lon Chaney Jr plays a wolf man, and John Carradine, Dracula and Glenn Strange, a monster of Frankenstein. Mad Scientist is trying to "cure" both monsters of their "diseases" using modern technology. Science. When it is found that a scientist is a beautiful nurse-assistant's hunchback soon in the film, the viewer is drawn to the fact that this film will not be a typical universal fare; This film heralds the kind of lean exploitation we could take for granted in 1950. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind slower rotation of older movies and black and white games you won't hurt This movie is recommended to be viewed. Afaik, this is not currently available on DVD, but AMC sometimes broadcasts it, so be careful, or you can always wish it on your TiVo!
