Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" 1998): Starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. This is another lifetime film, made exclusively for television, released in 1998, directed by the long-time director of the television series Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by real events, it's much like most Lifetime movies, a warning story for women raising awareness of a predator lurking in the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case, coach). Young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (playing a little girl in Jurassic Park) delivers a highly convincing performance as a sportsman at Mickey Carlyle High School, raped by her coach Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and must suffer in silence. No one trusts her story except her own mother (Susan Blakely). Mother and daughter fight for Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film is somewhat dragging, it is finally predictable, sometimes too melodramatic because of the drama itself, but in the end it is really powerful. The performance of Arian Richards is daily soap, but is strongest throughout the cast. Her facial expressions, body language, and overall behavior are realistic about how she, as an aspiring sportswoman, adores her coach, is violated by her, and now has to live with shame, trauma and more, to fight him in court. William Bumiller plays a role with the ugly kind of duplicity, though it is far from negligible. Previously, he used other stellar athletes who remained silent and reached the top and looked outwardly innocent. Lesser-known actors like others, William Bumiller has never done such a role, but overall he has a credible and strong performance. It's especially worrying to see him in this role because he's a sexy leading actor in everything else he does, including some of the lesser-known films and the soap opera "Head of Light". The only real problem I have with this film is the way the film is structured. As the film opens, we watch Coach Ansom, who is about to rape Mickey. However, this leads to poor character and story development. If the first scene was instead of the introductory credits sequence in which we see Mickey's running / running in the city across the lake, we would have a better character because we don't know that Coach Ansom, although he seems to be interested in the success of his star sportsman, is really ugly. and we would see Mickey adoring the person she thought she knew, and then she took a gross awakening when she realized she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is not a viewer for television drama (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Jump, Outer Limits, Lois and Clark, Earth Conflict and Films such as La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan directed another Lifetime Film, similar to This is "Stand Against Fear "(1996), who tells the seriousness of the event, the trainer lurking around the showers where he rapes his student is truly disturbed, his message clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always aliens and can take different forms and their reasons they may also include high school killing to support the causes of the fight against violence against women, and calls on women who are silent to testify and fight by not causing further harm to others, despite further negative assessments, this film does a great job of expressing its message and should be dedicated to mothers, daughters, hi gh students (including both men and women) bad, like rape, is silence when it happens is even worse.
