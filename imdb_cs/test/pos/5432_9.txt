This film reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up knowing that the Emperor is really naked. Our electoral process is unclosed and depressed. My awareness is increased and I want to see a change in the world. After a short while I lulled back to my little satisfaction and "bubble life". In the best sense of the film, this work will ferment into edible goulash for me, and like in the "Network" I want to be condemned to say "I AM WHO I AM, AND I HAVE NOT ALSO ALSO ALSO ANY!" But to whom? My vigorous youthful idealism was slowly reduced to the concerned parent with silent conviction or rather "faith". "Man of the Year" reveals how much I long for the honest and sometimes humorous taking of our present political situation. Dobbs Line "I breathed in because I thought what the hell it is, it's in my hand, I inhale it." "It was refreshing or it would be if he was the Clinton president." Why can't politicians be honest and set the tone for debates? Do we have to realize how much veneer is said to be real? Am I sick of this electoral process, someone else? Remove veils and set the agenda for our elected officials and take them to a task (not re-elected) when they continue to leak and not represent citizens. This film can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians who spew rhetoric. Great movie!
