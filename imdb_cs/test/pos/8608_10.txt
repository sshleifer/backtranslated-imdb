The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids the mere sensational portrayal of his incredibly frightening events of August 6, 1945, in which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were destroyed at a time. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented peculiarity of the catastrophe, which focuses on such beautiful images as the diabolical mushroom cloud, which is silently silent in the distance and black rain that sprays the face of a young beautiful woman. The rest of the film follows the consequences of the last incident that brings the atomic holocaust and its consequences (more than 100,000 people died from radiation poisoning) to the understandable level of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and its small "community". bomb. The survivors strive for normality and continuity, especially by trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuka, but the imminent possibility of radiation illness obscures every aspect of their lives. Yasuk's potential suitors, naturally shy from a young woman, no matter how attractive, who could suddenly get sick and die. True love, when it finally appears, does so unexpectedly and ambiguously. We remained curious whether love across classes was more a sign of Yasuk's condition as "damaged goods" or ordinary humanity, thrown into a bold relief by the harsh circumstances beyond the class division. The film's classically moderate style amplifies the impact, replacement, eloquent inner shots reminding that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Oz. Imamura's mastery is evident, for example in the paired scenes of Yasuko bathing, the first to emphasize her beautiful back and legs, the second to look her hair. The shots are almost like narrative trajectory book creations and distill their tragic essence. Documentary realistic realism is violated several times for expressive purposes, perhaps most distinctly in a scene that reveals a troubled inner life of a shocked veteran. The scores of renowned avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and stunning black and white photos make a significant contribution to the tense atmosphere of the film. When in the final film, Uncle Yasuko (Kazuo Kitamura), a laconic narrator of the film, looks at the empty sky for the rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white images suddenly become so appalling they are almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or anywhere else for that matter) could be compared to the great, humanistic Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s. This movie is one of them. When I first saw him, I sat down stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, amazed at how I was a great tragedy to inspire: horror and compassion.
