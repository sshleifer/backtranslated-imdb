I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and told her how much I enjoyed it in this movie. She sent me a signed photo. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and in addition to Jean Peters in the lead role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won the Oscar for playing the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando played as Zapata) (1952). And she also starred in "Captain of Castile" (1947) at Tyron Power. Since then I have tried to find a place where it is available, but so far I have not been successful. Does anyone have any suggestions where can I find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I don't know about it.
