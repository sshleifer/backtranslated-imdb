Although I can't say that Larry Hama has ever seen one of the old cartoons, I think something would happen if I wrote cartoons, cards, and some comics. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old cartoon, this is largely a continuation of the same except for a few new characters - and more insane Cobra Commander. We still have all the old favorites too, but for a personal note, one thing that has always irritated me was that "Duke in charge" thing when tons of other * officers are instead *. Battle sequences are similar to the old series; The main trick seems to be CGI. It's generally pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.
