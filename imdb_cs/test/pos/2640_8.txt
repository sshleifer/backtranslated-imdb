Big party movie, following the adventures of Bill and Tom, two high school mates at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live a straight life while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously all the time except the party. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own, he faces many problems, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves to keep his rent, but he moves Bill to turn upside down. This movie is a non-stop comedy from start to finish and is my personal favorite. The soundtrack features a virtioso guitar by Edward Van Halen throughout the film, also features rocker portraits by Lee Ving and Ron Wood. The 70s Legend Pornstar Kitten Navidad also performs! The 80's classic film is worth more looks. Now all that needs to be done is the highly anticipated release of the DVD! If you like this movie, check out "The Last American Virgin", which is similar to "Wild Life". I rate a lot.
