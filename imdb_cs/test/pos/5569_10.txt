Watching this series will probably feel like our parents felt Star Trek on their first track. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. Those stories that made you forget how to blink, what characters make you jump into TV, join action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair bend in amazement and endless admiration. In short, we start with John Chrichton, an astronaut who gets into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from badguys in black, ironically known as peacekeepers. More colorful characters consist of D'arga, a big guy with short temperament and swords / laser rifles. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who is a plant. No, it is. He is also a priest, but with an average smudge. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a fat lazy bastard who flees helium and generally does more harm than good. Later in the series we meet the most sexy stranger ever on TV, namely Chiana. Young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. It is played by Gigi Edgley, a name you should remember. One of the many things I love about these shows is that, since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy in error, he keeps references to "Real Life." Namely, when John has a little difficulty accepting the fact that 80 years will be frozen as a statue, one of his complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead. So Frell all the other series, get your Dren together and spend Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you Sci / Fi as you know it will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape
