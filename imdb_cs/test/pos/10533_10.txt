I had such great hopes for Teletoon Retro to broadcast it, but instead of having such a show, the ones that don't get the treatment they deserve are sending things I've seen dozens of times before. Centurions were the highlight of my pre-school years. I know this may seem a little clich√©, but it's true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of those cartoon characters that I really had in love with. It's bad that Teletoon Retro doesn't see it as much as the people of my generation. Otherwise, Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
