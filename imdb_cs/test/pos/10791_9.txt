Oliver Stone is not the one who should avoid film or theme. He is eager to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Check out his resume for proof! This film is no exception, on the contrary, it is another jewel that unfortunately has not seen much. <br /> <br /> As controversial films go, it's the one you should be grateful for. A movie that should encourage you to think about you, the people next to you. There are prejudices and that each of us has one or the other form. Either we admit it or not, but it's easier to categorize people and be like: "It's" xyz ", it must be like ...". Now I could read too much, but I don't believe it. I believe that Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he is trying to do these things. And if it's something you want to explore (like a movie or in yourself) than watch this movie and be excited!
