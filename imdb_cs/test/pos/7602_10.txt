I thought this movie was great, not only because it's a storyline, but because it was shown a very great cast. I read that Drew Barrymore wasn't exceptional as Josie Geller because she's beautiful. Yes, maybe, but in a movie that was playing outside, which brought a girl who was looking for who's in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for hopeless romance out there, I'm sure I am. David Arquette is crazy when her brother Rob and Michael Vartan are amazing as Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did a great job as her friend Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be himself. I think this movie should get more credit than being labeled "little"
