It has been since 1972 that I have seen this film and I still remember it as one of my favorite movies of all time. I'd buy a copy if it was on DVD and it's bad it's not. Do you think anything that would play with Peter Sellers would come back. Much better than "Be There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small role for such a well-equipped artist. It's a bonus in this movie. I think the medical discipline may not appreciate this film because it really makes fun of the profession, and one also realizes that Sellers was never available to treat them because his bed side way sucked in as well as his urine sample analysis.
