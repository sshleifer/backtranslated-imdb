"Everything I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." The scene was a rebellion. I also argued on the bar scene where Hyde snorted horseradish and tossed the bird to a Japanese boy and said "Buddy Pearl Harbor". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high. <br /> <br /> A fun thing, this 10 line request. It seems that you bash for your comments too long, not too short. I hope I won't get 1000 words before I get to line 10. <br /> <br /> I'm still two lines short. Sorry when I think and drink or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Okay, I think I got to 10 lines. Thank you for reading!
