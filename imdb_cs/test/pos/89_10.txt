It is a piece of cinematic beauty and shows other Quebec cultures to others than any other work that comes from la belle. It takes every person to the first experience of culture, to the point that you want your hair to stick in place and live, breathe and eat everything Maurice Richard. The book does the same as short, and I am glad that it was necessary to read both languages ​​as long as I was studying French at high school. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier tell this story. His moose fat accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was also good, very surrealistic, which draws attention to the idea that it is funny to dream, which is charming in better days gone. Again, as a symbol of quebecoise culture it is insurmountable. One can almost feel the turtiere is boiling slowly over the wood stove. This whole film deserves endless praise for being proud of being Canadian and encouraging all of us to appreciate the finer things of the family and our roots. I'm from Ontario and this movie fell in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard in a toujours vivre dans nos coefficient.
