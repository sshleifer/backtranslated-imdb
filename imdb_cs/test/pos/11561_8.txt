Well ... it's 2005, and when you finally look at this movie, you'll probably shout it for dating. But here's the thing, the script was bold, the exposure of the music industry at the time was just as courageous ... and it took some time to get the music that the Americans created from Africa to the same level. as white acts.

Harvey Keitel "Retrospective." Gee, I had no idea that Harvey Keitel DID had so many movies - and when I saw it, I was surprised. This movie is not a masterpiece but deserves more merit than it is.

From this, a lot of lessons and many "insider" deals have been drawn. /> <br /> If you can find this uncut ... worth it vat.
