This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and not do. This is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked it even more than the X-Men. In fact, this film is a kind of cross between the X-Men and the Matrix and it came out earlier. Wesley Snipes has a great job with the Blade character. He just isn't a heartless super hero. Also, this movie is not sugercoated to get pg-13 ratings. Certainly comic books are mainly for kids, but in my movies I like a little more. Let's face it, if we were in these situations, we should break into a storm, so it's more realistic. This comic adaptation also has something that doesn't. Good fight at the end between a bad and a good guy. Let's face it, none of Batman's movies had a very good end to the fight.
