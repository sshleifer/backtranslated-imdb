It is important to note that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist filmmaker who held some very specific and specific theories about what the film could achieve, and how. It is simply idle to compare Alexander Nevsky with nothing more than a similar period in the US; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a totally different approach to film. If you want to appreciate this movie a little bit, try to learn more about Pudovkin's and Kuleshov's theories of assembly, for example, or to read a Wikipedia entry on Marxist's film theory. If you feel really brave, you can even explore the triadic forms of Hegelian dialectics. It follows that if you watch this movie without any understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't have it. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters do not play alone, they are to distill the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately exposed to greater than life because they represent stylized, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. The meeting is not wooden, it is slightly raised. It represents a completely different school than a more naturalistic, narrative style that Hollywood quickly accepted. Eisenstein's films are specifically designed not to be realistic. If something seems to be "obvious", whether lighting or a language or position affected by an actor, it should be so. Eisenstein was one of the early supporters of film as an art form, not just as a pastime. <br /> <br /> If the cut sometimes seems to be a clash of images, it's the idea. The shots are to contrast, Eisenstein's films contain and embody the elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely Marxist dialectics. So sit down, yell for the Russians and defend the folk heroes, boo the cowardly nobles and Teuton invaders and enjoy the difference.
