Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey). He is competing with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the liveliest person alive. The film shows its attempts to surpass each other. This movie isn't too much for everyone. It is your face that does not maintain a damn attack in bad taste. Crackers has sex with a woman with live chicks among them while his sister watches; Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them strapped into the basement, and sell children to lesbian couples; Divinity and family have parties that include cannibalism, etc. It's disgusting, but unnoticeable in a way. It's upstairs and it's so insignificant that it's a little fascinating. As director John Waters says, it's bad taste. It's also fun to watch - acting is so pathetic (especially Massey) that you only look at him in disbelief. A friend laughed loudly at how bad Massey was (improved in later pictures). <br /> <br /> This is not for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years, it's still shocking. However, if you have an open mind and can have a lot of extreme behavior, you need to see it. The only part that was really too much is what divine does at the very end.
