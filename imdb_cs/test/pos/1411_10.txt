Thematic song often goes through my head after all these years. I've never been much a television watchman, probably because I just joined my busy teenage years when our family bought the first set in 1948 and never became a part of my life. But since the first episode of Lawman I have been addicted and it's the only TV show I've planned for a week. Intelligent, believable, well-written and well-functioning and John Russell is still the most beautiful man I've ever seen. (Peter Brown wasn't a dog, either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is one of the most underrated TV series of all time. I hope I can find some episodes for my grandchildren.
