I'm horrified and horrified that the network has canceled the Talk Show with Spike Feresten !! What's wrong with The Fox Television Network, the Talk Show cancellation with Spike Feresten and the replacement of Wanda Sikes? For those who were in the network with a short attention span, Wanda At Large was canceled because viewers were tired of her ugly insults that would shake the audience, and Wanda Sykes spews her own brand of vengeful crazy mud jokes is not humor, it's ugly and repulsive. Apparently, Fox's television network has rewarded Wanda Sikes because she has received a promise from leading President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda has recently been poorly tempered before the United States President, is not funny, and viewers laugh only to take on and please Barak Obama. The Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a true sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively insulted any guest or performer. Spike's well-rounded personality always happily, torn out of life and self. And his Filed Pieces during the first two seasons with actress AFTRA Mary Mae Atwill, because Mae West 21st Century was absolutely hysterical with Spike Feresten's partners: Judge Joe Brown, Trafficking Wives and The Last Season is James Kyson Lee Episode where Spike Huts with Erika Over the Internet on the show. Despite the budget constraints of the network for complicated field cuts and WGA Strike second season, Spike Feresten did not escape his sense of humor or show integrity. Spike Feresten's Talk Show has always appeared in the upcoming new talent, and his stoners comedy, Stoners of Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi, has been regarded as a top-notch with excellent production value. On a professional level, Spike Feresten was the best executive producer and Set Producer, Brett Webster and his fabulous production team were one of the best production teams I worked for in my AFTRA career. It would be a very silly and sad shame to cancel the Talk Show with Spike Feresten. Unfortunately, his success could be taken into Comedy Central or another network and financially, which would be a valuable loss of revenue for FOX TV. <br /> <br /> On behalf of late night Saturday Fox Television Audience, Talk Show supporters with Spike Feresten, including all cast and crew, please Network to keep the Talk Show with Spike Feresten Franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful Fox Show.
