Captain Corelli's mandolin is in itself a fantastic film. It's nothing like a book that can disappoint its enthusiastic followers. However, the film is a masterpiece from the perspective of its work. Views are spectacular and acting is not too bad !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant - so different from his usual hero characters. Penelope cruz is great and the movie really holds. I think this film must be considered as an individual project - unrelated to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up the rights of the film script, so the film is an interpretation by director, John Maddon. Go and see this open minded movie - you'll love it; because there is a touching story of love and war beneath it.
