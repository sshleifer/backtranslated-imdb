Captain Corelli's mandolin is not an Oscar rival, but it was pretty good. I must admit that Mrs Cruz can really act. It gives very good performance. In fact, he makes his friend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed pleased. I bet he felt he had returned to his roots like an Italian. But I learned something. One more chapter in the horrors of Nazi Germany many Italian soliders killed during the period there surrender to the Allies and German eventual surrender.
