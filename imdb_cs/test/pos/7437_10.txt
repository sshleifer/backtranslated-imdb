I can't believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good story and fighting, oh fighting !!! This movie was great! Characters. They look real enough to be considered real. They definitely resemble those of the game. The scene in which ... all the scenes caused me to drop my jaw. Fantastic 10/10 Graphics Story. Perfectly explained. Plus, how Aeris comes to help Cloud at many different movie times. They explain it very well and make your jaw drop as perfect as it is. But repetitive struggles have a story, but that's just a small thing. Story 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was just amazing. I really don't know what more I can say, except that this film was almost perfect. I LOVED IT !!!
