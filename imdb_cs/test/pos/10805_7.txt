I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu trip, plus the time is definitely fascinating. Being a Wajda fan, I was disappointed, and that may be an understatement. The film never took a film flight - there is no basis for hostility between Danton and Robespierre, etc. Basically, the script was weak (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, eventually! Also there were some amazing actors, but they never really grab the attention of the audience as they should. Depardieu comes as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant Danton ... not exactly the picture we mean. Woijech Pzsoniak is incredible, as usual, but again, the screenplay builds the boundaries of the great talent actors who can't fall apart. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda jump ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you're familiar with Wajda, then you know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed. filmem. Great cast, great director, but no good foundation. Bad, non-dynamic script. We need to get into Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) thinking ... what are their motivations? Uh ... who knows? One likes women, the other pills alone? Riiight. Ok, so if you're looking for a great French film Revolution, I recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performances, depth scenario, juicy bits ... definitely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is much better Danton than Depardieu ... the amazing Andrzej Seweryn apparently took some notes from "Danton" and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. ATTENTION! NOW! As far as Wajda fans are concerned - you are better off with "Man of Iron / Marble", "Promised Land" and so on. Cheers!!
