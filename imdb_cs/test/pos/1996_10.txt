This film is the most impressive Turkish film I've ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror movie. I have to say that I was excited about watching the movie for some reason, the first reason is that the story is impressive, I think at the end of the movie you realized all the details about the movie, which makes the movie attractive such a movie like that. This shows that the Turkish film is improving over time. Although the first attempt to make a horror movie, it was really successful. I encourage you not to miss this movie ...
