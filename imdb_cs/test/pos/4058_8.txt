This is really great fun. I really liked it, although it wasn't so original at all, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are just amazing in this! Rene Russo is excellent in her role, and there is a lot of laughter to be all the time (especially when Deniro spoofs Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover lines), plus the final is just great. Yes, it's just another run of "Buddy Buddy", but it works thanks to the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy! It's not that big, but I found it a great fun and a perfect way to go through the time, but the main villain was very weak and not very good at all. This is not by far the best "Buddy" Buddy "cop movie, but it's still very fun, and I thought it was pretty well done and also written!, Plus the end was pretty funny!. liked, though it wasn't the original at all, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I highly recommend this! Direction is very good! Great work with the camera, cool angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. cheeks, he seemed to be having fun, had some funny lines, and had a really great character! hilarious, like De Niro did his usual funny things, apparently loved to be in front of the camera, and while he can make it stu Ff in his sleep was still a lot fun to watch! (Murphy's rule !!!!) Rene Russo is fantastic here!, she had a great character, and when she didn't have much to do, she added a lot of presence on the screen and her character was always great mav√Ω, it was just great! (Russo Rules !!!!). William Shatner is surprisingly surprising and not overdo it, and the movie has brought some good laughs. The main villain is fine, but a little weak and somewhat weak, he still did what he had to do adequately. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 of 5
