The film seemed a little slow at first. But she picked up speed and got to the point. It turned out exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons for the "gadget". I enjoyed it. This is very close to reality as a movie about atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was especially pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.
