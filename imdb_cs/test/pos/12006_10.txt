Probably grossly underestimated by all who have never experienced hell in the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe, everything has happened, in fact, the reality was even worse than the movie. It resembles Orwellian fiction, only this is no fiction. John Hurt is as good as ever. Yes, the script is not full of action, but neither is life. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, yes thousands. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave the communist "paradise" without government permission. Sometimes the film drives tears in his eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America has to offer. Excellent movie, we recommend! God bless our country, USA!
