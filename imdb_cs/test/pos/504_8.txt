However, the film is very comic, it doesn't matter. This film is radically diverted from the boredom of "Talking to the Vampire" (though it was good) and pictures in beautiful action scenes. Very convincing story and interesting with surprisingly good performances of all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Depends on? No way.
