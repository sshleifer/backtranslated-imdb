Sam Elliot is brilliant as the hard San Francisco detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed in a meeting with informant Fallon, he beats the informant to death and releases his body into the river. The next day, Fallon is assigned to a newcomer and is charged with investigating the whistleblowers. Sam Elliot is doing a good job of portraying a man who was tortured by his murderous acts and the grief at the death of his partner who might have been involved in police corruption.
