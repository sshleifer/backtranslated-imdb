Follow-up until 1965's "My Name Is Barbra", and shot in brilliant color, "Color Me Barbra" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clown comedy, feminine romantic anxiety, and charming solemnity for crazy blankets hour show-biz razzle dazzle . It's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and a mystery. With its Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, it is also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, though several of her songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as interesting as a trip to the museum (with the idea that Barbra is becoming pictures in pictures, an idea that works better than you might think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word "face"!) Is a girl's cute without really becoming charming. Yet it is a lively, jazz special - not as emotionally irritating as "My name is Barbra", but certainly a clever kind of effort.
