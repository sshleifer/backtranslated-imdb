This is a great movie he has to own. I really liked every aspect of sword fighting, romance, costumes were really well done and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I also loved mystery and magic. Also, the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is. I really like the heart of the king in the sense that they desire peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in a world like this with flying ships, castles in the sky. I also think it was really nice to bring the animals to the movie. I also thought the cook was really funny. I watched it many times in one day and I still didn't care. They just want to bring it to DVD.
