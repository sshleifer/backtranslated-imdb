No no. Yes, "Who is the girl" has the distinction of being one of a series of Madonna movies that bombarded, but I had more of this movie than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan", the character of the Madonna is doomed to being a second-violin to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work on. No respect for Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, an outrageous character, only in the 1980s. Although it may seem like "cheese" today, it's actually one of the best Madonna movies and one of her most valuable films. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con who is sent to a slammer for not committing a crime. After four years of good behavior, she is released from prison. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from prison to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two meet together, it becomes madness. Sir John Mills has a small role as a wealthy businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest on his roof. This movie parodies everything. Wealthy people, slim figures living in Harlem and totally destroying Louden Rolls-Royce, gay cops following Madonna and Dunne around the city, and Dunne are stuck with fiance Wendy Worthington, who allegedly slept with every cab driver in New York Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend Caroline in sixteen candles). Hilarious! In addition, Dunne is also in charge of a rare leopard breed reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". Plus, Madonna had a great platinum blonde 80's looking back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Put it all in the mix and you have neglected WTG. Madonna is the dead body queen. There are moments in the movie when the line says absolutely straight and surprisingly turns out to be funny! So one of the best straight comedies should be played. Madonna was supposed to do more comedy and it was a pity she didn't choose it. Later she became more controversial and got into more dark, sexually charged roles in the notorious "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". Some people say that Madonna can't act, and that's okay, people have a right to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people don't see the difference between a Madonna playing a character and a movie instead of she still only sees Madonna, and that is why she is given more respect for her music than for her films. It's still a fun 80's comedy. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you don't like it, so I'd recommend it to Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and enjoy it! Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from the first 80's of club days in New York, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.
