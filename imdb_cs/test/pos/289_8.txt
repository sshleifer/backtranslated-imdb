I have to admit that I had little expectation in this film. But I was surprised to find it fun, interesting and fun. It's a fun thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were times when my hair stood up! Even better, they were very fun, sometimes hysterical, comic moments in the movie (you'll know what I'm talking about). There are also several great special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). Acting, on the whole, is very good - a way better than a typical low budget horror movie. Especially leadership (Jackie) and many smaller support roles (like a lawyer, a couple living next door, a pizza man) are fine. If not, the film would not save my interest and I would lose faith in the story. This is a good, interesting low budget thriller and is definitely worth renting!
