I made another look at this film and still consider it good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that can really act. She appears occasionally in a soft core such as "Love Body" and "Lady Chatterly Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig also did OK with a beautiful body and a charming accent. Too bad she's not in more movies.
