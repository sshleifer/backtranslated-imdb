It is a very good black comedy with a great view of how different people perceive the same situations. The three main characters met with a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who is different for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they tell other people about them, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. This is a very good concept, probably not entirely original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, making it a good black comedy. The game is just as good, not one of the actors looked out of place or from your league. The comedy is very black, in some scenes black, and many people will certainly offend it, but the black comedy fans will probably enjoy it. Overall, this film is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy seem to love it because it's definitely one of the better black comedies. 7/10
