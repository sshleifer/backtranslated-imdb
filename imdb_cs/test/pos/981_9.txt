"Big Fat Liar" comes as a welcome - shallow but welcomed - breath of fresh air after too many movies featuring bathrooms, body fluids, pets on sour, gas jokes and crotch gags. After all, "See Spot Run", "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" signaled the Kiddies' Degenerative Spiral. Worse is the realization that young viewers would later be saturated with the more vigorous offerings of "No More Films for Teenagers" and "Slackers". The film, written by Nickelodeon Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally contributed to the "80s sitcom of Head of the Class"), plays Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with good lies to get out of scratches. Where is English paper? Daddy suffocated by Swedish meat.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) publishes an ultimatum: Turn the paper by the end of the day or take a summer school.Jason rips the story called "The Big Fat Liar" and is struck on the way to a limousine school carrying a numb Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves the paper behind, this time no one hears the truth and Dad tells him he has lost trust. A few months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) sees a movie preview of "Big Fat Liar." Go to Los Angeles to trigger the wolf's life - all to learn that he stole Jason's pa even get some sympathy for some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former chauffeur (Donald Faison), movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, played alone) and stunt coordinator (Lee Majors) . . <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" is borderless, known to be known by his sitcom "Malcolm in the Middle", Muniz is easy to take root, but he doesn't have much to work with. Likewise for Bynes, who headlines her own Tracey Ullman-like sketch show on Nickelodeon. All spasticity is given to Giamatti, whose eyes bulge and her cheeks twist with every offensive insult. The movie gets stuck by just trying a high road and should enjoy its target audience (especially since most of the high chips are played at Universal Studios lot). But here's one head-scratcher: The message is it's worth telling the truth. But have we not seen Jason get into his decree by saying white lies in the whole movie? Well, at least there's no shit.
