In this episode I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane jerk around the crew, though the whole thing seemed too long. Sure, history was some fun for a while and the end was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together. I think the problem was that I enjoyed seeing Trelan when he was full of pigs and fun. Talk about the murderer's mood - from the unpleasant but welcoming host to condemning Kirk to death! But despite that, the episode was pleasant and worth it. In case of Trekkies hard to see, for others it is just a nice mill run.
