Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and is suspected of being murdered in "Throw Momma from the Train," said Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "Black Comedy" was invented for this madness, which is a takeoff on Hitchcock's "Aliens on a Train". In fact, Owen (Devito) gets an idea to kill Larry's mother in exchange for Owen when he killed Larry's ex from watching this famous movie. "I saw the movie. Criss-cross," Owen tells Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about when he seems too late - just like "strangers". Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his former wife, Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put her name on it. She became a great celebrity, appeared on "Oprah" where she refers to Larry as "a beast". Owen's in Larry's class. He lives with a derogatory Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has a vision of poisoning, keeping scissors in his head - you name her. Not long after seeing "Strangers on the train" being in Honolulu, he watched Larry's wife. While leaning against the ship's rail, trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and sneaks up ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to ask him, but he's in Owen where he is encouraged to live until the end of his life. he negotiated that he didn't know he'd done it. You know, "criss-cross." There are several scenes copied from "Strangers" that are merry. Especially I loved Larry's confession to the sleeping Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, just like Guy thinks he was talking to Bruno's stepfather. Crystal and DeVito are perfect masters of comic dialogue and timing, and laugh, often loud. Ramsey is horribly funny - absolutely "out there". Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles - Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has something to do with the port. <br /> <br /> The end is very clever and the whole movie lets you laugh.
