National Velvet (1944) A movie he gave to Taylor on a map. Costarring then number one at the championship box office, Mickey Rooney. Taylor plays a girl in love with her horse, and when jockey Mickey Rooney is unable to ride the Grand National, the Lun spunky cuts her hair, pretends to be a boy and races a horse to ... well, I'm not gonna break the end. It's a good melodrama that MGM made famous. And it's another early color image to be loaded!
