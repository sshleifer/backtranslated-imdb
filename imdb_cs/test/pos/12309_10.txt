James Joyce, probably, could write some of the best sentences in the English language, and his short story, "The Dead," which ends his collection of Dubliners, contains? In his final? Perhaps the most perfect paragraph in English It's good that John Huston, who was trying to make this story, ended his career. As with the Red Badge of Courage and the Man Who would be King, Huston honored the literary source, but did an adaptation film. And with "The Dead" (which was completed after Huston's death by his son Tony Huston), we get something almost perfect in literature and film marriage. commentators point out that "this is not an African queen" (or it may not be), this is a kind of film that is uncompromising for the audience. Each of us has become involved through Portrait of an Artist at School and one has to bring maturity by realizing how words and images can touch us. As with silent films, Huston is looking for something pure and works with confidence for many years, leaving the world a masterpiece that equals Joyce's original. Many Irish Theater World veterans are recruited to Bring the story of a man full of self-esteem (and false doubts about himself) that is strengthened by the annual party host on the eve of the Epiphany. What is in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of celebrations, songs, dance, poetry where he is asked to give an annual toast to two sisters and their nieces who hold the party. He is distracted by the fact that he wants to take this opportunity, and this distraction leaves him vulnerable to the experience shaken by his country's wife. While his ego is shaken when he hears the story of his wife's past, it is also a gift where everything that seemed to be important throughout the evening is swept away by the imminent mortality for all who live. And instead of trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story "cinematic", Huston brings a voice and we hear the incredible words that show up when we watch "snow falling weakly through space and faintly falling". It is the perfect solution for the filmmaker's adaptation. Cast is all we can hope for. Since this is basically a testimony of the power of the written word, and as it connects us through a common experience, it seems that every performer is increased by his role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide range of play and her young boy account, who once loved her sears not only Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. When I think about Anjelica Huston, it's the transformation he does in this film; And when I think about her father, it's the movie I remember first.
