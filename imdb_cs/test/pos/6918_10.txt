This film is completely underestimated. It's a film similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson Waiting, as well as the Adrien Brody's restaurant and the classic Breaking Away movie, which is about young adults who are trapped and know they're stuck, with little or no chance to break free. Death By Pizza is delivered about intelligent, free thinking, an artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is Stuck and Waiting, bitter on the hypocrisy of the world and bitter on his own lack of direction and desire . Will meet his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult who is so bitter that he chose a crime path. They both end up helping each other to free themselves from bitterness, allowing them to break apart. She plunges down to death. Will's life is filled with trademarks of a young "stuck" adult: soul-sucking, sweaty, underpaid task, rude customer, ex-girlfriend who left him because he was a non-motivated, partial college degree with no degree , a house full of self-made art, and of course a new friend whose unholy choices help him save himself.
