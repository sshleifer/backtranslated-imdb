This film won a special award at Cannes for its playing and it is not difficult to understand why. (A couple of spoilers - but for the end, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in World War II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but have a spit when learns that he enlisted in the army. Boris goes to the front before Veronika tells him he loves him. Boris is shot, but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronica or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, rapes Veronica, who feels obliged to marry him. Veronica damaged and humiliated by the cowardly Mark is holding herself hoping that one day Boris will return. Excellent camera and wonderful works by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film, Kalatozov's next film, I AM CUBA, has at least two amazing pieces - one of which is a long shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, raises two stories to a cigar factory, watches through the window and followed by a long, long avenue parade - all without a cut.) Excellent acting, especially Samoil and Vasily Merkuryev (as Boris's uncle), which is all the more annoying with pure underestimation. A devastating romantic movie with the heart stopping Samoil's performance. (This film is often associated with another Russian classic ballad ballad.)
