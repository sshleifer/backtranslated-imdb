This movie is a warning to all people sitting surfing the internet in a typical day at the office. My Warning Is, Don't Reveal Too Much About Yourself, 2 Be Careful Who You Are! , there are spies on this internet thing. I thought it was so frightening that the combination of man and woman had done with poor Angela Bennett, I didn't realize that anyone could take the life away with one mouse click. my question is why does the computer make the noise when it works? Like clicking down it doesn't do this either. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on this internet. Also, why couldn't Angela do a CyberCafe-destroying program? I also thought that, like all computers, the disk transfer speed is slow, which is correctly rendered in this movie when you save the program to a floppy disk where the bar moves slowly !!! Angelo's house I really liked at the beginning of the film Why didn't Angel believe ???
