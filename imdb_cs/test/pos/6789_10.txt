I hope it will never become cynical as a society that would appreciate the simple beauty of this film: Beautiful to look at with a romantic English countryside and beautiful in the message of faith and loyalty. Watch it with your kids, especially with your young daughters - Velvet Brown is a great pattern for girls. It was one of my daughter's favorite movies. The story is based on the best-selling book, Enid Bagnold, about a Velvet girl whose entire life is her horse, Pi, and her freedom to pursue her "impossible" dream. I'm not going to say less of a conspiracy than I spoiled for the first audience. He lives with a large loving family in a small coastal village. This is the movie that Elizabeth Taylor stared, and watching the movie is to understand why. She is a natural actress who exudes inner beauty that matches her outer beauty-credible, passionate, innocent-she is the emotional core of the film. Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance like Mi, a young man who someday comes on the doorstep, stays and helps Velvet train Pi. This is one of his best performances. Anne Revere also stands out as Velveta's Oscar. Her strong, loving and wise character understands that life is not very valuable unless you follow your dreams: "We are the same. I also believe that everyone should have a chance to take a breath of foolishness once in their lives." "<br /> <br /> I highly recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from Hollywood's golden age.
