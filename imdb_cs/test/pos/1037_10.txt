I saw this series at PBS in 1980 at college and I still can't get out of my head, even though I've never seen it before. I remember that every casting (the cast was perfect, as mentioned in other notes), design, lighting and, of course, a story that is in itself sufficient to stick you to the set. Probably the best TV series I've ever seen next to the original "Roots".
