I was just happy to find this movie. I use a Walmart DVD for $ 5.50 because I watch a lot of movies (and I rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have a family and many friends who have served in Vietnam. This film really illustrates the pain I have seen in my friends solving what happened to them. I wish this movie saw more people - I think maybe more people would understand what happened to our Vietnamese veterinarians by watching these excellent actors in portraying one family damaged by this war. The story seems realistic - it's not stupid, but I felt what's going on. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez played father and son - their relationship was more believable,
