It ends with a declaration that "the movie you just saw was an improvisation" - once you felt like an idiot who thought improvisation was a good movie, and impressed by the genius of Cassavets ... once again. Of course, Cassavetes told someone that it wasn't really improvisation, on his deathbed, so ... it's the story of a black-and-black black woman, Lelia, who turns white, and her family: another passing White brother named Ben and a black brother Hughie. When he falls in love with a white jerk named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised to find out that he is black, and hence the individual ambitions and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure, Lelia is still hopelessly depressed over Tony, and Ben is generally ugly and violent, in desperate need of something that would shock him from his stale patterns of existence. Overall, I think it's really about stasis versus changing human life. I think Cassavetes had order organized enough and it was just a dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes somebody says something very unforgettable, sometimes it is unforgettable. What is amazing is the range of amateur actors performing their characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he taught when he decided to make Shadows, whispered to the ears of ten best students, and that was the result ... the guys playing Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I didn't like Lelia, but as the film went on, you see more and more that he's one of those actors who are getting better when tension and drama build - not necessarily the best with small calls. Shadows is celebrated by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959) and it is definitely recommended.
