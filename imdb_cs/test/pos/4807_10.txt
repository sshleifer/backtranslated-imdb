When I saw "only" about 200 Hong Kong movies at that time, I must say that this film is one of my favorite favorites. Not only is the plot of entanglement (and in some ways surprising, which is rare for any film these days), but the chemistry between the two main actors is excellent. Top notch casting! And although often even the most serious HK films tend to put some humor in all the dramas and actions, they often spoil a bit of mood, here jokes are kept subtle and woven into a plot, even improving relationships between characters. The music is also very good and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of a special edition of HK even cleared the image (the first edition was grainy) and subtitles, although the quality of the translation is still missing (nothing new). All in all, if you have to see a HK movie that is not a director of John Woo or has Chow Yun Fat in it, it should be at least on your short list! Really fascinating and fun watch!
