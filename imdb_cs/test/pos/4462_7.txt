In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, someone kills young, sexually curious boys brutally. The local police force is trying to keep busy trying to track the killer and scatter the list up to five major suspects, including the voyeuristic retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and the elusive, eccentric, voodoo doll who is following a witch named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a handsome young priest who directs the local boy's school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist helping the police, and beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), gorgeous but seriously confused. an addict who seems to have something for the very (I think, very) young boys. As is typical of giallo subgenre, the plot will not be fully revealed until the last few shots, but if you can hang there long enough, this movie will pay off. The screenplay (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red herring to a minimum and will interest you and the story is greatly supported by excellent locations, cinematography (Sergio D'Offizi) and score (Riz Ortolani). Acting, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans who have been weaned on his grotesque eighties, such as THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE, will find more art and less gore than one might expect, but they will still enjoy a particularly ugly chain crawl in the graveyard (bizarre but effective, set with the ballad of Ornell Vanoni's "Quei giorni insieme and te" and the long fall of the rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he used it again in his film PSYCHIC (1977). The scenes of killed children are mostly off-screen (except for strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to stay on the corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and, probably because of some anti-Catholic elements in the story, received only limited theatrical release in Europe.
