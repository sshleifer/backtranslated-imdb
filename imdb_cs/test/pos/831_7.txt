This is Van Damme's best effort I've seen so far. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent trying to stop heroin smugglers trying to move to the United States. The action in this movie is great and the battle scenes are among the best Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star of the martial arts genre. For more evidence, see "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched "The Shepherd", I thought Van Damme might not look very believable when he beat him on the screen. Van Damme holds his own, and while he's not as athletic as Adkins, he can still dig with the best. All combat scenes in this movie are well done and gun battles are above average for this type of movie. The only negative thing I can say about this film is that the story is little developed. I think Van Damme's motives should be presented earlier in the film, especially considering why he has a rabbit around. The reason he does it is very cool, but you won't find it until the very end. There are several other things that are never explained, but this is Van Damme movie so you know where the priority is in making this kind of movie and it's not character development. Overall, however, it is a solid action film that I recommend. So run at Damme!
