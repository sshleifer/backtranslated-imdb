A short history of time. The cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating, thoughts provoke and man ... brilliant. But this time I was hard to use this document. The way in which family members and professors are questioned is so unnatural. These members were interviewed for specifically compiled files and were uncomfortable. Mostly their accounts met as very acted and directed. (Intentional) Non-inclusion of asked questions manipulates the information into a very rough and impersonal format. I don't know who's responsible for the conversation, but they did a terrible job and took the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Still a fascinating documentary that is worth seeing if it's just interesting ideas.
