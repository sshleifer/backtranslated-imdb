No, it has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and cheerful character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a fine dramatic film, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind and one of the biggest movies ever. I'm glad she got more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because she really deserved that fame. In no case will it change anything. There's nothing wrong with the movie. It is a film production of the highest quality. And it's also a test of time. Not only does it not look, but its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains as important as it did in 1979. Timeless classics. They don't do these films today. This film is dramatic, realistic, simple, but brilliant, intense, strong, sweet and even tragic and sometimes depressing. Yet he also has gentle humor. He has no special effects, but who cares? This is not a movie or a place to discuss such things. For such a film, such a thing would be useless and totally useless. The story is very interesting. Actor chemistry is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the top three are the best. Brilliant actor Dustin Hoffman has his greatest performance here as a kind but distant workaholic, Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. A cute little Justin Henry is amazing as a loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, the son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (Frederic Hand) is great. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling. This movie also has an incredible character development. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to care for his son, trying to adjust these new responsibilities with his work after being abandoned by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how life is, the problems with his work and the return of Joanna who wants to care for her son. But Joanna is getting better and the end is an unexpected surprise when one sees it for the first time. This movie also has some things, such as scenes from the courtroom, where Ted and Joanna face brutal character assassination by loose lawyers. Another thing to see when poor Billy falls off a jungle gym with a toy (airplane) and gets seriously injured on his face. But again, the scene is very well done and what comes next is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses many blocks, ignores traffic and takes his son to the hospital. Overall, this is a movie that is a good lesson in life. This should definitely be the Top 250.
