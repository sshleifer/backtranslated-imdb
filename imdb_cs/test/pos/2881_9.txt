Look Back in Anger (Drama) by Dr Osborne's drama dramatization of Oscar Wilde's single novel positively revives the homosexual subtext of the original, perhaps too much. However, dialogue, acting, with the cast headed by Sir John Gielgud & Jeremy Brett, and brilliantly cerebral production (marked only by "too fast" end) make it worthwhile to every theater lover, with the capital "T".
