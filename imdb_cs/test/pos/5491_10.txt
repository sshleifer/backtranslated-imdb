I've seen several action thrillers in my life, which is one of the best! There are very few movies that I've even watched several times and that's one of them. Everything in this movie is fine: Clint as an excellent actor, Rene Russo as his silly partner (that's a very rare combination - sad but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his outstanding villain, but don't miss Eastwood's introductory friend, Dylan McDermott, who in my opinion fits perfectly into the role. original soundtrack CD (shame on producers!). The storyline makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement about the result of the battle between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this 10 stars!
