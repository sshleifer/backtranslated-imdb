SPOILER NIC but SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers just don't get it. But nobody even mentioned the word "s" if I saw it. Although I agree that the child has died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. It races on a slope in an old car, shoots from a cliff and ... "flies away". Perhaps the entire description of the form of death is an allegory, or perhaps it commits suicide in the car as set out. In both cases, "flies away" (c'mon, not so hard metaphor). Maybe I have something for Tom Hanks, but I was fine with the story. Besides earning $ for commemorating World War II, you have to love it for it. Yeah, I loved the movie and found it incredibly moving.
