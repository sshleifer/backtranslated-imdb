I recently bought this DVD and was absolutely amazed that Rush's songs sounded the same as when I first listened to them in 1980. Geddy Lee's line-up, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are so talented I want me to play them. Again and again. Songs remember Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Freewill, Closer to Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio. fans are singing there and have a great time and I swear that over half the audience was under 25! The writers who gave the rush regarding Rush fans like me relate to a bunch of jealous fools who like to taste rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco. Rush doesn't put on makeup, wear spikes, lip sync, wear lipstick, get in trouble with the law, and have a band member praise about how long they've been unmarried. All they do is have fun! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 100 of 100.
