Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> Ice-drawn virus <br /> <br /> He just didn't know how to play nicely. <br /> <br /> If you're infected, kill <br /> <br /> Because you're sick. <br /> <br /> The drug must be infected twice. Ice is a great episode; one of the season 1 giants who started to make a show and if you ask me, you really couldn't ask much better in the whole series. It starts with an amazing puzzle that is, in my opinion, really one of the best examples of the series. Alaska scientists drilled something from an ice core that, for some reason, caused them to kill each other. Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to see what happened. As Mulder says, it's either because they're brilliant or expendable. I take it because they should be brilliant or others ... The band soon discovers that the cause of chaos is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core. A small worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the show turns into a thrilling kind of person who has committed a paranoid thriller, while others are starting to suspect each other of being infected. This is not at all helped by the overly paranoid doctor Hodge, who is untrustworthy to anyone we have learned from the first thing he asks: seeing everyone's mandate to "make sure we are the ones we say we are". Events lead to the discovery of who is infected and the teachings of how to cure them. There are a number of things I like about the episode and of course some characters I want to slap in the face from this episode, as well as a few gaps, but most of them can be attributed to caution and not clear thinking. I love the bear since I first met him. It's a shame she has to die. I also like the scene shown from the perspective of a second scientist, as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. This gives an interesting intervention to our typical perception as a viewer, and for me it seems that perhaps we should not assume that precisely because someone is a government means they know all kinds of conspiracies. Just as Hodges is sorry for me in this episode, I think Mulder was to blame for some of the rashes that were made at all. I like Scully in this episode. First of all it can act like a frickin linebacker! Secondly, I like the focus on her horror of what can happen to them outside and how she tries not to let Mulder keep her trust and friendship. I like the scene when going into the room to sleep and first it looks like a picture of the previous group, all hugging and birthday gifts from them so that anyone can sleep in the room and then suddenly angry and pushing the dresser in the front door and in the last breath of soft as he sits on the floor with his knees tucked into his chest, we see the bottom of the poster on the wall that says "Bosom Buddies". This is great writing. The way to say without a word that Scully is afraid she couldn't even trust her best friend. Unfortunately, this increased suspicion leads the group to believe that Mulder is infected because he discovers Murphy's dead body, even if they haven't checked it out to find out. That was my main problem with character behavior that would easily solve all suspicions simply by giving them blood. But I think I would be indignant in the situation too. But then the stupid Hodges decides to have to assume Mulder is infected, even though Mulder is willing to give up and then willing to check and almost attack Mulder in the process. Fortunately, he sees that it is really Dasilva, which is infected and finally reaches resolution. At least as much as you can expect from an X-File. "Government" does not waste time to set fire to evidence of how this is always happening, and Mulder has another frustrating "pending" case. Finally, I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and leave you with haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not you who are. It is no longer possible."
