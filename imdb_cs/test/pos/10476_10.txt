This film says that there is everything that needs to be said about religion - I wish that the watching of all fanatics and would-be clerics would be required. The story of the turn of the century Danish villages about two very religious sisters whose late father was a strong priest who discouraged all his dreams of love and discovered the world and its many beauties. They are old now and have spent their lives and beauty. Their silent new help - which they "teach" to cook - is Babette (played by beautiful Stephane Audran, who has so much roamed the films of her husband, Claude Chabrol). Living in a village is simple and strictly reflects it. When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for the opportunity to prepare a feast - a real love job. The holiday process and his main guest reveal the message of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. This is a necessity to see the devotion with which Babette prepares a holiday and puts the general at the end. Perhaps the best international film of the 1980s.
