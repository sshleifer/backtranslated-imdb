H.O.T.S. is not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is the forerunner of the many 1980s era of cult classic tracks / frat films such as REVENGE OF NERDS and PORKY'S and post-cursor to the world-famous ANIMAL HOUSE. Good time if you dig a lot of big-titted 70s / 80s Playboy type chicks and cheezy slap-dick comedy - but nothing very remarkable if you want to use it as a hack-material ... <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is an "unauthorized" association of sexy outcasts who fight against popular and fashion Pi girls. This one has pranks, aunt Jemima-ish house breeder, and even an overheated robot who makes it a relatively fun viewing if the boobies are your "thing" ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I love breasts so much (or probably more ...) as another guy - but with all the sleazy sh! t I have seen, I couldn't help but wish a few hardcore scenes to make it really worth it. I knew it wouldn't happen, but I still want H.O.T.S. he had a little more sex and a little less trembling. It's not as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S, or ANIMAL HOUSE, but it's worth a look at the fans of those types of movies ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot - this has a perfect shower -private Danny Bonaduce apparently the best part of his career outside of his "reality show" ...
