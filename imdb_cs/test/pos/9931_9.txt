Watch out for Scottish Play! Dario Argento returns to the classic form in his stunning and tormenting opera, regaining the serenity he lost in making convoluted and crazy psycho-shocks like Tenebre and Phenomena. Indeed, based on a simple story that is compensated by rich scenes, imaginatively brutal murder sequences and refined photos, the film feels like Argento, which we once knew. The only real violation of Opera is the lack of Goblin's score, which has provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento's biggest films (here, the opera selections are wonderful). <br /> <br /> Several relevant actors fill the production. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra lookalike Cristina Marsillach handles enough cracks and compassion to understand the role of a tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as horror film director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively short role (watch the DVD appear featurette for an interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly brazen and angry at the end of her relationship with Argento!) Stage Fright Fans (next excellent giallo 1987, directed by Michele Soavi, who served as the second opera unit) barely recognizes the last girl in this movie, Barbara Cupist, as a stage manager (I think it's the glasses that do it)). With me, this is often the little thing that matters, and Argento's fascination / obsession with lonely nightmare paintings makes it my ideal filmmaker. The opera is full of tiny details that have left me. For example, I love that we never see the face of "Great" Mary Czek. I also love the scene where the killer scraps the tip of his deadly sharp dagger over the TV screen and shows the performance of Betty as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I resist even the most grotesque veterans who should not cover up when the "grate pin" is placed over Betty's eyes. In short, Opera is a pure, tense and tense thriller. With his solid performance, lucid focus and literary cinematography, he strives to be in the same league as Deep Red and Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Opera could be the last big giallo?
