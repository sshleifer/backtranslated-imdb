Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply tells the story of time within one of these subcultures. It is basically an objective view of a group of forgotten people who live their lives regardless of the rest of the world. In general, a good movie. She had fun, provoked thoughts, and showed lives that would not otherwise be visible, right in our own backyard. Everyone should see it. When I lived in the United States all my life, I didn't know there were citizens who didn't know they were citizens. This film helps to illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of the southern state. Clear conclusion: If it is really real, then what's out there, what we don't know?
