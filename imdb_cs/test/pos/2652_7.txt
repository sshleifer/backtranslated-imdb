First of all, the film should be a good story. It should be fun - and fun doesn't necessarily mean "laughter", and that doesn't necessarily mean "light". Basically, that means you're bored while watching. As brilliant as it may be in 2001, it is a difficult movie to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing / iPod fumbling) generation. Her slow pace, and sometimes the unbearable amount of time an actor would have to do one thing (such as Attempting to rescue a crew member floating in space), will prolong your patience. On the other hand, cinematography is brilliant, the film skilfully directed, the final provocative thinking and score ... the score is chilling, especially when the crew in the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goosebumps, big time. This does not happen often when I watch movies and is proof of the skills of director Kubrick. It is considered a classic and many people consider it the best science fiction film ever. This in itself is a good reason to look at it if you haven't already. However, just because everyone thinks it's a great movie, it doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it. Either you will (like it) or you won't. Maybe the slow pace isn't such a bad thing. Directing your attention to something somewhat static and slow for 2 and a half hours can teach you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience with all of these fast-moving, fast-paced images we are exposed to these days (be it advertisements, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I myself think it's a "memorable" movie. But not one I can't see again in the foreseeable future (unless I'm in a special mood for slow-moving movies). From here I have 7 stars out of 10.
