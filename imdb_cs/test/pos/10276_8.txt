I loved it. It starts out like a pretty normal, somewhat cumbersome French art movie, and then suddenly, in the middle, it's turned on. This section is brilliant as you realize that you have not seen 2 plots. Unfortunately, the end doesn't make much sense, which is a great pity. Oh yes, and it's great shot.
