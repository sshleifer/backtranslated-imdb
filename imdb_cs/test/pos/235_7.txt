Although I have a strong feeling that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this is pretty good. I liked the music and the dance and the end as Gene got the girl. My favorite part, though without a doubt, is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It's a movie that I think everyone should watch at least once in their lives. So you haven't seen him go out and find him today! I'm sure everyone has a friend Gene Kelly who has this movie in his collection. So go to your house and pop popcorn and enjoy!
