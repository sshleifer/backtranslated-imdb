This is Christmas time! Birth from the point of view of rebirth, or at least that is what can be hoped for in Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years old when an Italian cinema did not produce an artistic piece of this size. It is an absolute contemporary film that can also be considered the same quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, no name to be given. Finally, it is also a great production for the Italian standards of that time. In this film there is a precious balance of different elements, all of which are understandable and enjoyable at different levels of realization. Real poetry, real humor, real tenderness, real drama, real beauty. No rhetoric, no simple surrealist abbreviations, no typical tourist Tornatore-performances, not through play, no director autoreference. There is also a cool use of two heartbreaking Nina Simone songs whose music, I think, has never been used the right way to score. So if it is not a real revival for Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary development for Emanuele Crialese after his next Respiro is another definitive beautiful film. You must not miss "Nuovomondo", it is a kind of "film movie" that is useful for filmmaking, watching movies, useful for joy and understanding of life. Francesco Cabras
