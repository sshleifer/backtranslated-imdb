As for the Christian film goes, it's typical. Delaying the mega-budget trying their best. Some times short, sometimes hitting the brand. This almost hit, great acting can only carry the movie so far. H.P. Lovecraft, and Frank Peretti was a good idea. All that was needed was a better back story and better character development to make it a great movie. The visuals are not so bad, also the clever possession of the demons in the last few minutes has helped keep the tension at a good pace. It could use a better end though. will finally do "This Contemporary Darkness" as a movie.
