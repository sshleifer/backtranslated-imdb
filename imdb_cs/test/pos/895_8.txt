Laura Gemser plays a photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There he meets a couple and other swinging couples. Everyone in this large, very tourist hotel with a huge pool. One night they have a pool party with "live" native dancers. It is very non-politically correct and very cheesy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (though the photo is gorgeous). Throughout the film, Emanuelle goes after every man he meets. The photo is very well processed in this movie. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth seeing on the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco himself.
