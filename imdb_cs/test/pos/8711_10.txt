Words fail when I want to describe my feelings about this movie (and sequel) ... Does it have errors? Sure it does ... Starting with "Subspecies" themselves, they weren't done well enough for a special effect. For a flock of film consumers who care about quantity than quality, about cheap entertainment more than depth, bullshit like "blade" (don't even deserve a capital letter), "underworld", "Dracula 2000", "dracula 3000" and so on are good movies that blink popcorn and drink a few coke ... What makes subspecies an excellent effort for anyone who claims to be a Vampire fanatic, on the other hand, is obvious: The vampire itself is Romanian, the story takes place in Transylvania (scenes shot the place is more than convincing) and the atmosphere is not based on any "action-packed" chase or expensive orchestral music. The Council itself is the source of the atmosphere ... This is how the Vampire should look like and should behave! Add a breathtaking gloomy castle with dark corridors situated in Romania, including some typical Vampiric elements (eg Movement of Shadows on the Walls When Vampires Take Off to Flight) and Have a Work of Art! In short, if you, like me, are fascinated by vampires and feel that their appearance, as well as the environment, should be sinister and dark, there is no better place to look than in the Subspecies ... or Vampire Journals magazines. , Brilliant spin from the former ...
