This is the underestimated Kellie Martin's best role. It is based on a true story and tells the story of Fusius' efforts to save the members of the Diamond family and other Jews he meets over time. One of my favorite movie scenes includes the heroic act of Sister Fusie. All children should see such models of scenic roles as this, very little and far away. The film is well written and acted. I am a movie lover and I rate this film 10 to evaluate the imbd system. It's on my top 25 movies of all time and should be released on video. Mike Porter
