I hope for the continuation of Gen-X. Fortunately, my hopes have come true. You have a lot of actions, comedies ... silly comedies and surprises. I think newcomer Edison is really hit in the movie, but I'm really stupidly bothering Sam 'Alien' with English. Although the film had some flaws with robot graphics and silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action setting is much stronger than the first. This film is a more American feeling because 60% of the film is in English from Cantonese. This movie won't disappoint you. I recommended it to young people who care about pure fun. <br /> <br />
