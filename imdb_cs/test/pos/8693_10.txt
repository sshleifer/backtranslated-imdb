This is an exceptional film. It's a part of comedy, a partial drama, a partial tension. The dialogue is excellent. Most actors and actresses were very famous in their day, for good reason. You probably know someone, even if you don't usually notice older movies. They are also everyone in a role that particularly suits their talent. <br /> <br /> One fix that needs to be done for other users' comments is that two people, not one, are reported in an accident. Perhaps the unfortunate two are a reflection of what the writer considers important in life. The movie is too engaging to worry about who it is until it happens. The story is premature but does not lose the quality of an older movie. Time and effort were spent on improving the camera and soundtrack.
