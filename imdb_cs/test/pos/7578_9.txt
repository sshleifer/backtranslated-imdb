I enjoyed two of three films in the "Sarah, Plain & Tall" trilogy. This, the last of the three, was definitely one of the "good" ones. It's a great family movie with a wonderful act of three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. The storyline is simple but well said. The only partial performance was one of the children. It was interesting to see how children grew from the first movie. Of the three who were first, "Sarah," was the best filming with beautiful cinema. This film did not, but had the best story. She had some really tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
