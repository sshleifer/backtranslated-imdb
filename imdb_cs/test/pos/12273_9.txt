"Zen and Lanscaping Art", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what happens on one special day of his life. Zen works as a lanscaper for the upper middle class family. Mrs. House is trying to get Zen to help her cheat on her husband. Unfortunately, her son goes to them instead of her husband. From this point on the film begins speed through many revelations among the characters along with the possible involvement of the house man. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is humorous, clever and overall well written. The actor's timing of the actors is also very strong. It's a fun, lightweight movie that I strongly recommend.
