I'm watching a lot of Vampire movies. I know I have vampire movies. Hammer Films has always been my favorite. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from start to finish. Dubbing is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies so I'm used to badly dubbed movies. By the way, I really liked this movie. SFX are great. Even though the Jackie Chans portion in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie, he is pleased with it. Fang work is excellent. Acting is not great, but it could have something to do with bad dubbing. Perhaps the real language would sound better with the film if I understood it. I'm sure Gone With The Wind sounds even worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own it on a DVD and won't be involved with it. I'm sitting on a shelf next to a Hammer DVD.
