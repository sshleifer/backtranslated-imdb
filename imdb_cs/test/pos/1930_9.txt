It's a jewel. As a production of Film Four - the expected quality was actually delivered. He shot with a great style that reminded me of Errol Morris films, well arranged and simply clasped. It's been a long time, but scary to the point that it's unbearable. We know that something bad has happened (one can guess the lack of person participation in the interviews), but we are forced to see it, a bit like a car accident in slow motion. The story covers most of the conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentary films, he did not try to show how the grim sides of the stories could be shown, as well as the fault of the people who stayed behind him and wondered why they didn't stop him in time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that captivated me after seeing this very well-crafted documentary.
