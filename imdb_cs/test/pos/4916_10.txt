L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient audience looking for adventure. There are no explosions or drama straightforward. Like Lynne Ramsey's films, the director works with mood deeper than narrating in a way that is both efficient and incredibly moving. Because it does not rely on unjustified nudity, or superficial pop-cult. Story Stories, This is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign movie I've seen (also, see Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now" gets a lot of bad press because he sells as a horror movie. The movie, like L'Homme, is more than what can lead you to believe. If you are in the mood to sit and be absorbed by the subtle, transformed cinema skills, you'll love this movie.
