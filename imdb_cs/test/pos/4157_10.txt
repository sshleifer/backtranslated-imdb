This film is an impressionist, poetic immigration experience, a reflective look at confusion and fear that could be associated with emigration. These are aspects that are not generally taken into account in films about emigration to America, and in particular to any country, and the film vividly and convincingly captures the nervousness and enthusiasm if ignorance that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants are expecting to emigrate to Europe. United States. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic, unrealistic ideas about the United States that are spread on a trip. One of them is that rivers run with milk, an image that is depicted poetically, impressionistically in the film. The film is soundless and silence seems to reflect the unrest of ignorance that the locals have about life in America, or if not about it, about a vision that is significantly colored by superstition and fantasy. This means that the film captures a more realistic reality, a boat ride to the United States, and a process of sucking that had to pass on Ellis Island. Riding on the boat was rather boring, which was a lot of time. The cabins in which the incoming people are asleep are displayed as extremely crowded with beds four or five inches apart and lacking much light, which was certainly the case below deck. Again, the film is not accompanied by excessive music or too bright lighting, and the result is a fairly realistic picture of what it was for people who emigrated to the United States. The villagers do not have to be secular, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the oldest emigrants, the Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with an immigration officer who insists on concrete results, is quite bittersweet because they are not diluted or softened. in favor of conclusion syrupy and one sees the fusion of Sicily's realism with the extensive regulations governing life in the United States. Immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold-realistic realism and magic fantasy of nations contribute to a convincing vision of the conviction of Sicilian citizens or people, with little formal education to the United States. Activity is similarly barebone; it is not at all demonstrative or spectacular, but it seems more realistic to him. This means that all major artists, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group, are excellent. Although never smiling, the actions of his character speak much louder, and it is clear that (fortunately) the other members of the group, his two sons and the above-mentioned older Fortunata, the boy's grandmother, have confidence in his leadership and respect his clear leadership. Amato fills his character with great grace and openness and testifies to his ability to make his character so capable and confident, while his character betrays very little emotion. One of the strangeness of the film is the accidental encounter with a mysterious English (excellent and appropriate mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and we wonder why she goes to the United States throughout the film. or what relationship he has to the otherwise unanimously Sicilian emigrant group. Finally, it is finally revealed, and the revelation is typically done realistically and does not appear to be particularly melodramatic or imaginative. The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who has a firm vision of a realistic, though sometimes superstitious, view of the world that his characters occupy and represents it competently and confidently. In fact, he is fantastically confident given how realism and superstition could come together in the film. It is worth exploring the experiences of immigrants.
