I would agree with comments that have already been posted on this page by the previous editor. First, in the 1980s, I came across this film when I was employed in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many of the blades focused on the psychiatric profession hit home. I particularly enjoyed the ending where a psychiatrist would speak to a hospitalized Grodin. Believe me, it's pretty accurate. Of course, the doors at most psychiatric hospitals are not locked or used many times these days, and every hospital MUST have a license to have a "padded room". br /> <br /> But a beautifully underrated movie and definitely one that is pretty fun.
