"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's most famous short themes for good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The storyline - as it is - is the old basic principle: a man who has a hen sits on a night with a friend and a few other girls. It's a solid and well-used comedy, but the difference is that it's Harry Langdon himself. His slow, inefficient, confused, innocent character somehow found himself in a marriage to a woman who feels that all people must have an iron fist, and he just pulls her into cheating because she can't say "no" to cheering muttered Vernon Dent and cute algae-fluttering girls. It's a very grown-up problem of getting such a helpless, childish character. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. In a wonderful comic book business, she can't bring a new girlfriend to kiss goodbye: she squeezes her cunningly under her hand and rubs her hand shyly as if to punish her. The film is a three-reel comedy, ten minutes longer than the two reels that Harry Langdon had previously played for Mack Sennett, without any further plot. Maybe it was even designed to be a two-warrior. This works beautifully because it gives him as much time as he needs to inject slow reactions and confused looks and half-action where so much of his comedy lives. It's at the best place and the show is really a strange charm for Harry Langdon and the ability to weave a comedy out of nothing. His little smiles, his gaze as he manipulated the money he hid under the rug, childrens attempts to enter the fight at the end. I think his comedy is forcing us to recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time allows us to understand what Harry doesn't have (for example, the fact that women who Kindly brings to his friend to encourage him after he thinks the date has been blown out, they are actually whores, forcing him to realize with a bit of sadness that we are no longer so innocent. His comedy is just as capable of telling us "Awwww" as it makes us laugh, often at once. Here Harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife, wants to tell his wife, whose boss and take back power in his relationship, wants to end the fight against two violent men at the end of the movie, but he just can't influence his surroundings so much, and sometimes we all feel this way. The film is perfectly directed by frequent director Langdon Harry Edwards; It moves at a fast pace and never stops and at the same time makes time and presents the best effect of Harry Langdon, a reactive comedy. Vernon Dent, a frequent film for Langdon, plays one of the roles where he becomes an almost comedic partner in his very effective pairing with Harry. Gags have spread out in such a way that it gives maximum effect, and at the end, Harry gets his own version of Lloyd's or Keaton's style. Here comedy is not in Harry's big reaction to the danger of sitting between two moving cars but in his slow motion. It's a jolly movie and a perfect example of one of the most unique talented humorists I've ever known.
