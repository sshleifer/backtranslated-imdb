I was looking forward to seeing the movie since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so happy to have it. It's a really amazing movie. The actors are excellent, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just in place. I love James McAvoy and I can't wait to see him in December in The Lion, The Witch and Wardrobe. Romola Garai is also amazing. Don't forget to watch it in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby," two of my favorite movies. Overall, I think I liked this movie because it didn't work out. It is difficult to tell a story, in that you are very likely to offend a lot of people or break yourself and make it an overly sentimental sweet love festival. But they avoided doing it altogether, instead making a movie that is real, honest and touching, yes, but never overwhelmed. Very good. Surprisingly well done. Go out and see, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
