I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I doubted comic book movements. Since the series "Batman", "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other miserable pg.-13 bombs, I've avoided everyone at all costs. I would like to ask myself, "why can't anyone make a movie that is rated R and stay true to the story, how hard is it?" Finally, my prayers were answered by Blade. This film will emerge directly from on-screen pages with total violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yeah, sure, many of the actions contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the film was shot just like that, not overboard, bringing good length and never boring moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cold as the first. Blade is really one of the best real comic movies I've ever seen.
