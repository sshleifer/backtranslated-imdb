This twisted comedy is well processed and controlled. Very funny and the quality of production is excellent. It is easy to see why this short film was accepted at so many festivals and won awards. Travis Davis is playing great! Richard Moll as Tim brings the darkness and premonition that gives this film the right turn. The old man adds humor to the story. And who would not love the suicide goldfish! This short will bring a lot of laughter. And don't miss the credits because they play in the end!
