This film, based on the true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I have seen in South Africa's racial relationships; a very good lesson in the history of the confusion of the 80s of South Africa. I put it on the scale of American history X as to how a young man can seduce Aryan doctrine and how "certain" segments of the Christian Church have taught a false doctrine of race justifying injustice. It's a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, today it's a rarity in movies. Violence is well done to show the seriousness of Gerrit's crimes and the magnitude of his transformation. One word about Jan Ellis, who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. It brings you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended for his performance. Another standout performance was Mpho Loving, who plays Moses Moremi, one victim of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to pull out some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance. Very good movie to show teens.
