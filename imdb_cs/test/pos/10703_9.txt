For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson in American filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Documentary films rely on casting. Choose and choose the characters you think will enhance the dramatic and entertaining value of your movie. <br /> <br /> After you have shot a ton of shots, you combine it together to create a movie with ups and downs, turning points, climax, etc. If you're having trouble with existing shots, you can either shoot some more that give make sense, find some footage, or be smart with your narration. The claim that filmmakers used footage that is not part of the film (favelas beside beautiful beaches) will not hurt the value of the film as a dramatic piece, and a particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not entirely true classification . In any case, you can use shots that you can. So they did not happen to have police violence in this area. Does this mean you don't include it and just talk about it, or maybe you put some animation so the audience isn't "deceived"? At my place. <br /> <br /> For a promising end, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end up with a note? Just because it takes place in a foreign country and foreign movies pretty much at the end? Let the strangers draw a dismal look at life. <br /> <br /> Let us think Americans think that there may be a happy ending in the future. It can just be one.
