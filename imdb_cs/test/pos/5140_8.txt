I took a group of young people who were at the same age as the protagonists and approached us all. I agree with the second post, Wilson's guy made an ungrateful script into a big side character. It's good to have a movie for a certain age demographic (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how he thinks and maneuvers in high school. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet did as a great teacher. He held us up. The level of questioning of the children was reasonable. Their motives were specific and not as some A.D.D. rebel. The settings and music were beautiful. Overall, if you enjoyed Hole, it's really similar.
