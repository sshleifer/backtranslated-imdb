I was "turned on" for this movie by my flight instructor and now I'm wondering how the hell it was almost five years before I finally discovered it. If you have any love to fly at all, especially the attachment to WWII aircraft, it's an absolute must-see, absolutely better than pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and filmed more than thirty years ago in rivalry with the famous "Battle of Britain". There are times when you feel like flying with your wings, literally avoiding the cloak of your leader when you are on the Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> As a historian, this film has touched me deeply about the situation which survived tens of thousands of brave Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who fled their homeland from 1939-1940, got to England, fought with the greatest bravery for the survival of Western civilization and then were after the war when Communists were arrested returning to their home country, they have ruthlessly abandoned us. I stood atop Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears in a cemetery for Polish soldiers who attacked the mountain that the British and Americans could not take. I also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful city) and studied their history. I believe that their story of abandonment should be a lesson for us today about the duty to brave allies. But back to the movie. If you love flying, check out this. If you're interested in a World War II plane, you'll be sure to see it. No doubt the most brutal, straightforward and terribly fast-paced scenes that have ever been repeated for the film. And yes, if you're looking for a touching romance, it's also in heartbreaking detail. Bill Forstchen History Professor Co-owner of World War II P-51 Mustang "Gloria" Ann "
