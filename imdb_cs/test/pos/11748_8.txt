Age will not hurt the beauty of this love story from east to west. Ignoring the glorious and beautiful title song and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatic biography of two remarkable people trapped at the moment of countercurrent involving social conformity, fanaticism, war, doubt and the need for immense courage. In the background with Hong Kong, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean War. As Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, fresh and a little weak; Jennifer Jones is perhaps very near-perfect, as Dr. Han Suyin, turning doubt-torn and ecstatic, eager and hesitant. Others in the big cast include Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; many of the best Hollywood Oriental actors have played smaller, unrecognized parts. John Patrick's screenplay followed Han's excellent novel; the direction of Henry King was always strong. The story of the story is how reluctant Han was to fall in love with Elliott, with her demanding and demanding schedule as a doctor and doubts about their future; and how afraid he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their affair became known. The film is undoubtedly physically busy, interesting and often beautiful. The lovers' hill is a beautiful bay where it floats, built on an already busy and crowded business town, at large social events and on the streets, hospital corridors and traffic arteries. With Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye makeup and Helena Turpina's hairstyles, great work of decorators, sounds and lighting, the art department and everyone involved, this must be one of the most memorable productions in the capital outside the US. All the time, and one of the hardest to capture on film. But what most remembers are lovers, fortunately, extremely young people who face courses against them and evaluate exactly what they are - then they act as if love matters and conditions that are set as obstacles to love, no. The highlight of the affair is that Mark returns to war; then Han accepts his letters, even though he knows he was killed; The news seems to be better. A world that matters everything that matters, courage is the price of entering this world and is always a summer on a high and windy hill, and they are subject to poor conditions above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be sacrificed. wealth or brushed aside by the militant forces of evil. Indeed, love is a many-wonderful thing, Dr. Han says; and this film stands as one of those doctrine shining evidence, shining like a pearl, timeless like a Chinese proverb and beautiful as a polished background hair.
