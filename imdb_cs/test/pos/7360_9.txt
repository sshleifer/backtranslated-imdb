I turned it on (from the cable) on a whim and I was surprised at it ... though very predictable this movie turned out to be quite enjoyable ... no big stars, but well managed and simple fun. With all the ubiquitous crap that is out there, it's very nice to get an unexpected surprise in the meantime ... and this little movie fits nicely on the bill. 9/10
