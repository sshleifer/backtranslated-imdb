For the tragic reality our young man faced, one story of hope was once told. Favela Rising draws one into a terrifying, dangerous and unjust world, showing beautiful color and moving music as one man and his devoted friends choose not to accept the world and change it through action and art. Funny, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful movie. I have also shown this film to many high school students living in the neighborhood of poverty and weapon violence and in love with the protagonists of Anderson. I recommend this movie to all age groups over 13 years old (due to headlines and some death pictures) from all backgrounds.
