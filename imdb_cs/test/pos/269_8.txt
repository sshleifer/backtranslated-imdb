"Primary Suspect 4" continues to exploit the erratic and persecuted seeker of truth and justice, Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the remarkable absence of Lynda La Plante's founder of credits. Filled with the same bold reality of the first three series, the second three series of Tennison holes against the forces of evil, while dealing with middle age, loneliness, indecision, a range of personal and professional issues and resolutions that are sometimes less than ideal. PS4 raises two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are episodes, each of which finds that Tennison seeks justice on behalf of the brutally injured, while waging war against institutions willing to sacrifice the interests of their victims for those who have greater good. In other words, Tennison has to overcome both the bad and the good forces, which always makes the gray PS scenarios even grayer and the Tennison war as a matter of murderers. A very good thing that is getting better from series to series. (B +)
