I saw the 'NSNA' just after I saw all Roger Moore movies and I must say it was so good to see Connery again. All the while, he proves that he is the only and only Bond. The film itself is not a masterpiece, but it is worth watching. The jokes sit here much better, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is a really good villain. But von Sydow is simply unnecessary and the score is often not good and there are several scenes that seem unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 2.5+ 4+ (1+ - 6-)
