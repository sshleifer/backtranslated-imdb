Despite his many mistakes, Hallmark's version of Gulliver's Travels 1995 is still the best adaptation of the satirical classic Jonathan Swift - mainly because it includes not only ALL Gulliver's travels, but also a satire that is often overlooked. Unfortunately, the dual problems of the book are very episodic structure and television budget (even quite opulent one) to remain. The book is a somewhat delicate collection of traveler stories moving from one surrealistic landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation seeks to impose a certain order on chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees Gulliver returning to England clearly traumatized and trying to to prove his Way of Insane Asylum, where his opponent committed him to the affection of his wife. England suddenly reflects the scene and comments on the paths that sometimes come into the real world. The problem is that the first lesson is more like a distraction, constantly pulling you away from the story as it becomes interesting. Lilliput's scenes are worse here, with the feeling that home scenes are too often designed to save them from making more expensive sets - this must be the only version where we don't see Gulliver pulling the Blefescu fleet behind. Br /> <br /> As Gulliver runs away, the tone becomes more consistent when he discovers that his situation is reversed, and that he is the beast of the giants of the Brobdingnag utopian, the guest of the floating island of Laputa who are so immersed in science that they have no common sense, guest / prisoner of a historian who relies on history right from source, offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding the world he wants to belong to only if he can convince the noble talking horse Houynhnhms that he is not uncivilized Yahoo, everyone the new goal convinces him of what is the absurd and petty kind of mankind. Mostly, it is a darker set of Travels than expected, with only Gulliver's curiosity and sadness and disappointment that didn't let him plunge into irreplaceable bleakness - and even this is compensated by scenes in asylum where it is more obvious that even if it is telling the truth it may well have driven him really crazy. It is in these scenes that Gulliver Ted Danson really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech, where he turns his court into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race. Being created for television, Yahoos is less literally scatological here than on the site, but for the most part it is a treatment for adults than one would expect, without real dulling. The star cast is certainly impressive and largely well used (if in some cases somewhat short) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Ned Beatty Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert. It's hard to imagine the upcoming version of Jack Black, which is close to being as respectable as this one.
