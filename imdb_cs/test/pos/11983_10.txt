I went to see this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was there. Joaquim had a relatively small part, so it was good that I liked the movie. In fact, I really liked it! Movie centers around two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is shy, retiring and Louie ... but Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request for Albert to let him go to Alberta for a while. Louie just got out of jail. Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course, when they do something together, there's a problem and it's Albert, who always falls. The movie's action is based on the adventures that came from Louie's visit. On the run is a chronicle of mad caps, zany, situation. However, Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter Joseph Minion (After Hours) will not always take you where you expect. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Of course there is a lot of complete comedy, but there is also a very gentle humor. <br /> <br /> There are also some good performances here. Albert Imperioli has played great. It's pretty well-known days of the HBO series, The Sopranos. Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who inhales his character with a cute, child-like quality. (No matter what he does, you just have to love Louie!). Both of these actors are outstanding in their individual characters. With Imperioli you will want to hug him and bring him home. Ventimiglia, well, you won't know if you should hit him or bring him home (and not to Mom!). <p> <br /> <br /> There are other great performances. Rita's character plays Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience adored her. In conversations with others who saw the movie, it was fun to discuss whether it was Albert or Louie who were their favorites. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can't say that. It was many times that I wanted the director to have a larger budget with him. There were scenes that called for greater budget freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with, and I believe you'll see a movie that lets you get up and notice him.) <br /> <br /> The end sequence was a bit of a budget sacrifice. Yet, a budget or no budget, the final screenshot, in my opinion, has combined the talent of the actor and director into an unforgettable, emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
