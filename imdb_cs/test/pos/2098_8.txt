This film was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera films. It's about a Samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He claims that his throne forces his former two children to flee to the woods where they hide behind a huge stone statue for 10 years. At that time, the new Samurai master proved to be very brutal and merciless towards the village and valley people. So it seems that the only hope of good people is a stone statue where the demon god sleeps; they want God to help them. This samurai film brings us traditional Japanese aspects, including fighting with swords, geisha and believers. It is an amazing and powerful story of survival and hope, with protagonists trying to triumph over pure evil. It is full of excitement, especially where children try to stay in hiding when an evil warrior is out to get them. In addition to having beautiful cinematography, with the seductive landscape of village and landscape-instantly reminiscent of antiquity in Japan. As with most samurai films such as "Seven Samuars" and "The Last Samuarai", this film is no less than a pure, sometimes graphic event. There are several disturbing scenes in the movie. That's why it's not a casual sci-fi movie. Yet she is strong and powerful, and she delivers the message that a good-hearted man can overcome all opponents, as shown in this film, and even a young innocent girl can calm the wrath of the demon god. The scenes of the god demon, known as Daimajin, stomping on his enemies and anything that stands in his way will immediately remind Godzilla or Gamera film. Overall, a strong and serious but hopeful movie. So be careful with your samurai sword. You wouldn't want to spew Daimajin's cages. <br /> <br /> Grade A
