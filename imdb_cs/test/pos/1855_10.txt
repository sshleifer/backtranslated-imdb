Return to Me is a movie you want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that reaches all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, strives for divine intervention when a person in a tragic accident loses his wife and again finds the love in a woman who receives the heart of her wife. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm performances like dedicated lovers who come together. But the real story lies in friends and family around them who love and support them in court times. As Minnie Driver's grandfather, Carol O'Connor is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as a friend, whose joke and encouragement underlines Minnie as a "sister", is funny, yet she is particularly entertaining in scenes with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and writing make this story so entertaining and moving that you look again and again. Thank you for making a film that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caregivers who love in difficult times.
