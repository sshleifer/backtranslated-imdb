I'm not a fan of this comedy brand - stereotypical characters playing their way through cops and farce thieves. But there are enough sympathetic characters to keep interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is delightful, but the one who really carries the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as a head boss (named Tony, no less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is why I'm writing this review (and the only reason I recommend it), in fact. You will have time on the screen. He plays perfectly the boss of the crowd, with comedy touches in the right places that try to avoid becoming the prevailing clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a complete joy to watch - a master of 'double take', and a real 'seeker' in those elegant suits and fedoras. Meesa says: A good movie to watch while folding or eating leftovers.
