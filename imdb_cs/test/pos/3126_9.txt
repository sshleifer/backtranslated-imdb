Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford will bring the joint stock company to the Utah desert to film the West and come with with this smaller classic. No John Wayne, no conflict heroes, no psychological research, no fireworks, just a gem of the picture. This file set stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. ). They are horse merchants who come to town to do something like a Mormon group led by Ward Bond. The group is about to set out on a path to their own settlement, but they know the odds and the hard terrain is against them. So they hired Travis and Sandy as a wagon for their journey. Along the way they get into and take together a traveling medicine vendor and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, commemorating his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension is added when the murderous gang of Clegg arrives on the wagon train. And there is also an atypical (for Hollywood) meeting with the Navajo. Most of the story and humor is driven by a clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he is constantly trying to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the Mormons, between the train wagon and the outlaws, and finally, everyone and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of noisy dance that expresses one of its signature themes of civilization coming to the border. Again, there is no Duke, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young, cock Johnson Ben Johnson, to have eye-catching screens of his own. He comes up with his own backstage, with that drawl and also when you see him making all the stunts ride alone. He's great at one of his premature awards. Harry Carey Jr., though he has been at this time for several years, is sometimes still quite raw, but he is nice. Ward Bond is his usual awesome, stormy self. I found Joanna Dru, who would be in what I see, a campaign, but here she is graciously inconspicuous. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden, playing 'Stupid', as he will be in Seeker a few years later. It's not more fun here. There are several absolutely spectacular b & w photos frequent Ford collaborator Bert Glennon. Not only is there a typical masterclass on the landscape and the horizon, there are also a few flourishes in a handful of shadow and (sun) light scenes. The soundtrack includes the legendary country music group The Sons of the Pioneers. You can't get more cowboys than that. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
