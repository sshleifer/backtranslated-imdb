It is a great romantic comedy about love, work, pandering to public taste and a middle-age crisis. The main character is a talented film director who decides to make a stupid PG-13 movie to get out of hockey with the IRS. It has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from deadlock to grotesque), and fine writing. It is also a wise deployment of the film industry. Metacommentaries include several excellent cuts between reality and the film being produced, and in some places the film deviates from strict realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of middle-aged humor.
