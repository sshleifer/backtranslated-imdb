I got it as part of the competition. I was looking at it, but I don't really expect much of a low budget production. I laughed absurdly, there are obvious references to other films in the horror genre - Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Friday the 13th, etc. All the standard clich√©s were there - a long way through a partially arid and somewhat terrifying landscape, inbred red necks, mysterious vehicles watching you - throw some really good funny scenes (siphoning gasoline out of a caravan) and dialogue ("f ***** g virgin? It must be an oxymoron .." and you have one of the best spoof horror movies for years, especially I liked the way the way our reluctant hero used his stress-related bleeding nose to great advantage.
