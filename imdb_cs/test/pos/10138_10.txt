The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the film. The story is filled with unexpected twists that keep the viewer in a constant ending. At one point you think something will happen to Coach Jones or Radio. Well, yes, but certainly not what you would expect. The film is in no way bored or too sentimental and acting by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. opinion. The end gives a long-lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. I think that was what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich were trying to do. First class movie. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
