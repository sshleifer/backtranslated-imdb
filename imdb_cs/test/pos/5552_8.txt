Pickle was the most underrated movie of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it is still seen as a bad movie. I'm telling everyone this to hell. Each of them does not understand that it is part of a comedy with a dramatic turn at the end. Danny Aiello plays a burned-out director with perfection and expresses a sad depressed man. the scene when trying to upload the last message is pretty good. The Basics of the Movie Stones are absolutely fun. "This is Harry Stone and I'm a man today!" In all the subtle and unfortunately misunderstood film. Plus a great portrait from Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope that more people will see this film because 202 people are not enough to reach agreement. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
