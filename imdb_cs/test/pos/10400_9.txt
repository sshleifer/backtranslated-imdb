Like a lot of horror fans looking for another great haunted swing, we plundered the Asian horror market for anything we could get into our hands, so no dark-haired spiritual lady was drawn. We had a good reason to do so, and there were such terrifying miracles in the Asian market as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon-Grudge, and The Story of Two Sisters. At a time when Takashi Miike began ripping mick out of the One Missed Call genre in 2003, the market seemed to dry out and leave open mockery and mockery, despite the ongoing Hollywood Remake Machine. Now, don't get me wrong, there were still a lot of good Asian horrors, like Marebito and Shutter, to mention just two, it would be like a minor genre of classics. But the lady of eager hair was definitely feeding at the party, and it was time to take the successful drunk hiker home to bed! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A film that is smart enough to pay a subtle tribute to its roots, but throws the rules out of the window. What I'm going to describe when it comes to conspiracy is likely to mean there's nothing new at all. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's best paranormal investigators, who accepts stories and guesses spooky events. She is beginning to investigate the woman's claim that she regularly hears a child crying in the house next door, but there is no child except a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharp when a reporter pushes his nose, but strange coincidences begin to appear. A psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a beautiful young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons and a very sinister demon named Kagutaba, which led to a really frightening showdown in a small historic town. . <br /> <br /> To say more about land could ruin the fun a bit. The film is filmed in "faux documentary" fashion and includes footage of TV shows and news reports, and labels over headlines let you know where you are in the timeframe. The film has brought more than just a few comparisons to the Blair Witch project, but in addition to filming and haunting a late-night forest, the comparison ends. What is refreshing Noroi is how they do not conceal modern horror spectators. If you expect ladies to look like they look like they look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in its slow, gradual build-up of horror, so deep it will hold with you for days after watching. The top is pretty damn freaky, but only when you think the movie is over will you get to the "real" end when the credits begin to roll, and the sweet saint f * ck is the killer. When it comes to acting, it's usually convincing. You get some "comedic" relief from the crazy, tin foil covered with clairvoyance, but it will soon dry out in the middle of the movie. The film also has a somewhat "more intense" feel than a lot of Asian spooky ghosts, as some of these events have a violent streak. Overall, Noroi is one who looks alone, late at night. Not since my first viewing of Ringu ten years ago, I was so beautifully crawled as I was watching a horror movie. It's the one that will itch you until it's too late, then it's under your skin. Just let go of this completely. And not a bad lady with her hair in her eyes? No wonder it was barely released outside Japan, let alone an American remake. Check out this, if you can, the basic display in my books!
