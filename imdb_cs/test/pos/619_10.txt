If you want to see a real thriller, rent it !!! It's not from the director or screenwriter of "Scream", it is not an exaggerated, overpayment of "television" actors who leave as "stars", and it is not a run of special mill effects. Instead, you get top, nervous, very strong (in violence) but an exciting nailbiter.
