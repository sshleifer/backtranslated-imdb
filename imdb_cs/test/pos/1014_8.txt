Finally I saw LAURE and I must say that I enjoyed it anyway and was appalled. Great is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is certainly non-existent, but it doesn't matter. The pace in small and the setting is exotic. The film has a lot to do. Unfortunately, he also has a few things against him. The first thing is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry. Because both play a couple and are on the screen almost all the way through the film, the lack of chemistry between them is a clear responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they shot this movie. Certainly they kept their attraction to each other by showing on the screen. Another problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the strongest I've ever seen in any soft pornographic film: our young blond couple is picked up by a helicopter pilot who is a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend. And Al Cliver is shooting it all with a 16mm camera! No no. Ridiculous. Later we see that 16mm shots are adjusted on the motion surface. While the footage is being recorded, Al and Annie begin to do. This scene is actually good, but the screen shots behind them were sometimes too many. He stared at the cross-dresser footage as he and his bimbo whilst piloting a helicopter almost chased me down the floor and laughed aloud. Should it be somehow erotic or believable? The last thing I want to see is a woman who delighted a man in the move, certainly when a man in a move makes such an ugly woman while he is piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie, as they did it, were fine as well as music throughout the scene. I just wish shots on the editing screen weren't stupid. Speaking of dragging, another boring conspiracy in LAURE that really drags the film is all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two women. Married trio is an interesting idea, but hardly registers as hot or even interesting. Both women are dull and we rarely see three who have sex. In fact, Orso keeps her clothes on almost the whole movie, even with Annie Belle. This is another small complaint about LAURE: it's nudity, but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it. In addition to the minor complaints and moments that drag the queen, LAURE is actually very attentive. I like these kinds of erotic movies from the 70s when the focus was on mood and atmosphere, not what we see today. ps: make sure you look at Emanuelle in Egypt, who plays Annie & Al but also another famous couple pair, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in this movie is also great.
