Surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly because I was confused with the title. I assumed that this was the impact of the drug culture on filmmaking, but it is not a far more far-reaching and intelligent film than one might expect. Demme did a great job of encapsulating the period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s. From "Easy Rider" and the collapse of the influence of study, through all those introspective films "real life", where brilliant young directors tried to express politically, sexually and artistically, to the beginning of the blockbuster and return of reign. money and their studies. As someone who saw the movies of "real life" Britain and the rest of Europe in the 1960s and then in the US revolutionary films of the 1970s, and sadly, the sequel is so fine that it was today. the most fascinating movie. Interviews with interviews are measured (thanks to DVDs, complete conversations are available as add-ons!) And movie clips are well considered. Also, as someone who just caught up, 'Joe', I'm amazed that this important little movie will get its well-deserved entry here.
