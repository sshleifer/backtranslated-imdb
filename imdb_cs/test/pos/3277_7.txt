A good old-fashioned flight and vengeful western dress that resulted in gravity when it put a little black social history into its conspiracy. The leader Mario Van Peebles, who is doing OK, a gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig will all learn well, their adventures are credible yet fun and exciting. There are some nice moody flashback scenes setting the hero character and behind the scenes, a good shoot-out ends as our heroes defend the city from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin is not bad at this pleasant, pretty powerful western.
