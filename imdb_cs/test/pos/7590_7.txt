This one reel made by MGM in 1936 showcases the talents of two of his young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a way, these short films were promotional trailers that represented new talent in front of the camera or behind the camera. Felix Feist directed the one that was a way to promote two talented stars to the public. The story is pretty simple. The orchestra, which has a public park every Sunday, will not receive the attention it deserves. Join two music enthusiasts, Judy and Edny, who love to hear the band's play driven by one of their grandfathers. Two of the older people who felt that there was no publicity for this kind of entertainment decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a popular orchestra that would attract a wider audience. Two Girls Embark on a Promotion Tour of Their Own Activity, Knowing, Calling and Running errands and helping their neighbors in exchange for a promise to attend a park concert on Sunday. Well, that day will come and hardly anyone will come to their surprise when the music starts. Both girls decide to take things into their own hands and ask the conductor to play a song for them. The result is clear, people all over the park are flocking to hear talented young singers, ensuring the orchestra's existence. Of course, the only attraction of the short film is inspired by the singing of two stars who are amazing in their release. Mrs. Durbin's opera voice fits well with Mrs. Garland's natural voice, which creates a beautiful duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it whenever it shows up on TCM!
