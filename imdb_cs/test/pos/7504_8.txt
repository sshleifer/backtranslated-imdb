Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. In the lead role of George C Scott, it redefines the phrase "tearing a new hole." In this case, the goal is the American Medicare and the great hospital system. Patients and doctors are dying throughout the hospital because their names and regulations are changing. Scott roars, screams and detonates his workers and bosses because they are getting more and more successful. His commentary on Dachau to one of his many bosses will certainly provoke laughter. He even beats and rapes hippie 3 times. This is the one that must be seen and heard as monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film.
