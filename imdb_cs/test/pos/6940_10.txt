For the first time I saw this doctorate in the UK in the 1980s and found myself captivated and then amazed at how such good intentions could go so badly. Previous commentators (who are Australian) have explained the evolving detail of the plot better than I have ever done, but I would like to observe what may be behind the governor general government of the United Kingdom. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become law in general. This is the case, and if we say that Conner's / Khemlani's mess was probably set up (how many businessmen / millionaires served Khemlani, probably without complaint), then the Labor government could be the victim of "imprisonment" that would have to be investigated by the Governor-General or until they see that the budget spread was the true result of Whitlam's helplessness, and DO NOT admit entrapment, sponsored by an "unknown person or person"! If his case that Kerr in fact did not have to refer to the law because fiscal circumstances outweigh all, then the 'royal power' bounds on irrational; The implications in any Commonwealth country are that literally "fiscal" rules, and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche violate any other rule, physical or mental, if they have control over the chain of handbags in the end!
