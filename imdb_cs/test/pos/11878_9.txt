What doesn't like it there? I caught it tonight and wondered how Hugh Bonneville captured Philip Larkin's essence without resorting to tics and caricatures. There are many layers to show the complexity of the main character and Hugo brings them to life. His careful mother, his unresolved questions with his father, and the inability to commit one woman. His poetry is interlaced and some scenes are captured in his narrative about the wife of a friend whom later propositions, but quite carelessly, almost innocently. It is not difficult to see where his attraction was to many women who fell in love with him (and knew about each other, kicked off and continued to observe him!). friend. It's always more than appearance, women have been moving for their baldness, deafness, and short sight. A beautiful nuance of Eileen Atkins as his mom is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
