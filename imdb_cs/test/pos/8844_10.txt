I can't believe I've never added my two cents to this movie! It's one of the best movies ever. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". These people didn't see this version of "The Thing" because it's up there with "Halloween". John Carpenter's work shines in this movie. He took a film that was already made and instead of "re-making" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant. Casting each person was great, the tension between them was real, it screamed me, scared me, made me guess, made me laugh, made me wonder, "who's going there?" in that movie. This movie had no Hollywood cake, no funny ending, and no brave move in 1982. One more great move. I was on a screening of this movie when I was on vacation in Southern California. Spectators on the screen! I wear those memories for years, it was so fun! We all thought that there was no way this film would be a hit on God's green earth. But it was in the box office checkout because "ET, Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" two very good family films became a box office in 1982, when this movie came out. The movie was what I was like, like an adult horror movie buff looking for, horror / thriller with adult script and real adult actors. Not children playing adults. She's not a little big-breasted lady screaming for the day, shouting for titination, but real guys with real problems bring some of the best monologues you ever hear. Damn, being a feminist, I didn't even have MISS women in this movie! And it's not good for Mr. Carpenter, because it wouldn't be there, it really wouldn't make sense! (Unless there was a "thing" in fact a woman! Something to think about!) <br /> <br /> I saw the special effects of what I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me do he sat for a few nights. That's what horror / thrillers are missing today. Today the directors are melting. Today the Studios are melting. Too much CGI and lack of faith, too much CGI and lack of story, lack of imagination. You are leaving the theater and forgetting the film in a week - or less - and moving on to the next opening movie. He stays with you. This is one of the marks of excellent film. <br /> <br /> I have written on many reviews how to pay $ 10 for a movie is terrible. For films like this, you would pay and not feel humiliated. This film is NOT for everyone. I find it horrible that they call this film a "cult" movie. I have found that the audience is wider than many would lead you to believe, and although it was not commercial success in 1982, it is an example of how to release a damn good movie on a bad day can make a damn good movie bad. After John Carpenter's movie, many people have copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and stories from this version of "The Thing". I'm now exciting to go to the record and say that this movie is one of the best movies of all time, very under review. Please take a look at this uncut, please check the letterbox and please hear it digitally. You've been talking about it for years.
