The Curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. The lively visual appearance, superb soundtrack and brilliant voice cast create an unforgettable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> Graphically wise games are definitely not sunken. Although some corners have been reduced over-all feel of the game reminds Disney Feature Length animations. The game is simple, and even a novice will have the hang of it soon. The game also offers a little more for more experienced players with their Mega Monkey Mode. <br /> <br /> Voice cast is one of my favorites. Dominic Armata's compassionate voice makes Guybrush complete and Alexandra Boyd is just as charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes for an amazingly sinister yet over-the-top villain, LeChuck. The game's charm also adds unforgettable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my favorite personalities, Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, Scrooge McDuck's voice). My hat also goes to late, great Kay Kuter and his unforgettable secondary role as Griswold Goodsoup. Michael Land's tropical and amazing soundtrack is one of Monkey Island's best adventures, made up of the best in business. The game is not perfect and some places aren't as detailed as the others, but I didn't have any handles with a simple ending game that I found very satisfactorily.
