I saw it on DVD with subtitles, which is a bit frustrating to get over because of the movie length. But I was all riveted. Being fascinated by characters and always involved in the story, despite the headlines, is proof of the strength of the film. It's a great job. I have him on the list of ten favorite movies of all time. It's the best foreign film I've ever seen in the last twenty years. I'd like to know the whole story of making this movie. It has to take a very long time and requires the use of hundreds of places. Unfortunately, using some hardcore scenes (on a TV in a motel) may cause some people to choose not to see it, but if you don't mind, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this.
