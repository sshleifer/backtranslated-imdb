The main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or sufficiently detailed. I'd like to see more of everything: shipbuilding, engineering, training, the first elevator to orbit, departure preparations, orbital Venus injection, all. I'd like to see more of the first leg, Venus on Earth, instead of being a zipper like a corporate bus. In fact, I'd like to see a story series about the Earth made of it, with an hour devoted to each planet and possibly another loop around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand viewers' budgets and attention. Science: Let us be just in terms of the time lag of light speed. it was a delay in the talks, but they let themselves evaporate as they reached the outer planets. Some conversation had to be presented to viewers and we must assume that the delay was adjusted for palatability; so there are no complaints. But zero for noisy spaceships. The only movie in which the spacecraft made no noise was Kubrick's 2001, and even after that he was equal to the crew noise that was breathing in the helmets - which was * very effective. I wish space Odyssey creators could realize how terrifying the glimpse of huge rocket engines in absolute silence might be, but unfortunately, Pegasus lets off the same roar as any other cardboard ship in any other SciFi carton. But the rest of science was excellent. No complaints, actually praise for bringing out radiation problems as well as they did. I just hope that if I do this movie, it won't discourage the BBC from making a really detailed version, but I assume it's not for next week or next year ...
