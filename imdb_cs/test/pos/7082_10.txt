If you are an IMDB viewer who put High Fidelity in the best 200 ever, then this movie is probably not for you. This film is as uniform as Steve Frears. Renee Zellweger is excellent as a writer of the urbane magazine, returning to her suburban Bucks County nurse to take care of her mother Streep (who brings even more hall power). William Hurt is an ideally occupied and helpless, unbelieving and egotistical husband. If this movie doesn't move to cry and laugh, then you're too much of a hip to enjoy it.
