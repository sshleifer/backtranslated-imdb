This movie was amazing. I've never seen a movie that has brought me to the harsh reality of drug use like this. There is no charming, sugar coating or celebrating heroine. This film shows the real struggles, pains and losses of the people going through this drug. A good movie, a decent emotionally packed acting performance and a great story. Watch a lot! <br /> <br />
