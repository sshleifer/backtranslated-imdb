Personally, I consider "The Egyptian" a particularly favorable light. This was introduced to me by a well-known Australian film commentator and critic named Bill, who was renowned for his insight and broad vision of people. and places and especially movies. This movie was perfectly finished by Bill and I came to appreciate his commentary and enthusiasm for this movie, which was all the more impressive as I watched him be literally drawn into him, one minute after minute, beyond his opening comments, on my first tracking. years ago. <br /> <br /> For me, it was powered, layer by layer, in half an hour, into interesting and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of his mistakes! But was it so tempting? a young man of idealism who learns and inspires his father? the peasant behaved like rubbish in his suffering? However, an opportunistic friend bothered but loved his friend, the central character of Sinute? and be sure that even the wrong hero, as well as so much across humanity of all companies and all the time? Yes, I believe in the Christian God, but I also respect the rights and respect that should be caused by ANY human being of a good heart who would not maintain or violate his neighbor's rights without just cause. As such, I agree with this film and its presentation of a man of good heart and belief in his belief in the sun-god he was dedicated to. Such people will always be welcome in my vision of the world, and hopefully in many other areas. A drama in a follow-up movie that I often watched as I touched my heart and soul. as surely as it seems to have infuriated the critics in his era. It's charming, watching the struggles and sorrow and love of Sinute, the doctor! When I look at it again, my friend in my heart always reminds me of Bill, a film critic who dared to oppose all the critics who had long since swept away. Did he criticize too many critics? that they make statues to honor stars, on screen or in history, but do not make sculptures to honor critics! In addition, he reminds me of every viewing of SUPERB & TOUCHING, a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not only relevant to the 1950s, nor some of the past era. It was meant for YOU & YOU, over time and place, for every man & woman & child and their personal ambitions about love and freedom and overcoming the obstacles of misunderstanding and gross injustice and tragedy to appeal to the people of the simple faith of many religions. it seems too much attention as the cause of war! Make a night of inviting or unfair violence, from fanaticism and denouncing attacks on others who are ruthlessly executed and take into account the benefits of this offer. Not for the sun god, nor for the power that proves that it is time and so old. Let this BIGGEST movie wash over you, like waves on the beach as well as hands of time? as life should be. And maybe you'll find yourself in your world of possibilities! No more offers lost! 9.9 out of 10!
