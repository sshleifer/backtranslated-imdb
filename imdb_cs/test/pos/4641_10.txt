Midnight Madness is a film that is unfortunately very underrated and underrated. With a flood of classic "nervous" teen / college films, this was forgotten. As a child, I watched this movie over and over again, fortunately I had it on video. This film shows a more tame but most exciting side of the eighties. Today we live in a cynical society, with drug abuse being the "best" thing to see, once in a while, a fun, innocent movie that is Midnight Madness ... that's if you can find it.
