Fata Morgana, a 1971 documentary made by German film director Extraordinaire Werner Herzog, shot over the years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with commentary turned on. It is a visual holiday of North African (mostly Saharan) images that is timeless. You just couldn't say it was more than thirty-five years ago. The film's soundtrack, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and the rock music Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality. The story of three different German storytellers (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid and Herzog continues and continues to import Eisner into this project, both in film and history, but in English. a spokesman for the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems totally venerable, which is much better for this project, although most of the texts in both languages ​​are somewhat useless. Yes, the interesting biblical sounds of the Popula Vuha Maya creation myth in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text that Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and the Golden Age), along with quotations by German poet Herzog of the name like Manfred Eigendorf, almost it seems to be the satire of the first part of the dark tone? This film seems to have been put together during the filming of several other Herzog projects concurrently - the fictional film I Dwarfs Started Small and the documentaries The Land of Silence and Darkness and the Flying Doctors of East Africa, but these projects only rejected the material for the beauty of the film, such as the air scenes the flamingo mating the lake from a distance that give one a terrifying unearthly sense, one that Herzog returns in his commentary. This unearthly feeling is present right at the beginning of several airplanes landing on the desert track, their images gradually becoming more blurry as the heat of the earth rises, and the distortion of the waves that make the margins image increases. That this film was influential in the film Quatsi Godfrey Reggio is underestimated. But while Reggio is happy to just throw pictures at you, Herzog has the ability that only American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has: break free from a completely separate vocabulary from the interconnection of images and words and addicted to emotions. first move. Analysis can fail when it is brought to such an endeavor. Often Herzog does not understand why his art is great. The best he does often is unconscious and mesmeric. That is why his contempt for the lowest ordinary Pope of Hollywood Hollywood is openly commented on. Perhaps the best example of this is the scene that Herzog tells us that it followed a severe drought in Cameroon. It shows jerky carcasses of cattle and Herzog describes an unbearable odor. However, the viewer may notice this from images of the black sun from dried portions of animals and blanched bones. But even in this commentary Herzog focuses on smell, not on deeper meaning. He is pleased to allow you to joke and interpret what you put into it and his work, such as the almost erotically feminized shapes of the sand dunes that resemble the scene from The Clock of Wolf Wolf Ingmar Bergman, where Max Von Sydow passes the hand of Ingrid Thulin's beautiful naked body curves. But the archetypal image in this film, which symbolizes most of Herzog's career, is the miracle of a long-distance car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake. She is deep, hypnotic, illusive, elusive, supernatural, but real, as is Herzog, a believer who came from a family of militant atheists. But then, like everything else, it ends.
