The third film in the cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation films and the third masterpiece in the series, "Joshua Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. "Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable" (aka. "Sasori: Animal Day" Where I Live "1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but it equals (or probably even exceeds) it in brilliance. the original Sasori series with the beautiful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute top in the WIP cinema and all the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house as no other movie. , the last director of the brilliant director Shunya Ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of them. The first film "Joshua 701-gô: Sasori" from 1972 is the absolute masterpiece of Exploitation and simply the Definition of Exploitation-Art. : Dai-41 zakkyo-bô "Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third" Sasori "movie" Beast Stable "keeps surrealism (though not entirely second, and even more social criticism than its predecessors, such as poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central to the film. This third "Sasori" movie is sophisticated and sublime in all aspects and probably the greatest of, generally brilliant, cycles (for me this is it, with the first as a close second). Again, "Best Stable" is both very artistic and very Exploitation-like. A visually stunning film represents an enormous amount of brutal violence and is once again crushing, as is the succession of great surrealistic beauty. Amazingly beautiful Meiko Kaji is again great in her role as Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I totally honor this beautiful actress and I'm sure I'm not the only one who does it. The rest of the show is also great, especially Mikio Narita is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with "Urami-Bushi", which Meiko Kaji singing as the main theme, which is great because the score is simply pure perfection. Like its predecessors, "Beast Stable" is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious movie lover can afford to miss. The whole Sasori-cycle moves high on my personal favorite list. "Beast Stable" is probably the most brilliant masterpiece of all! 10/10
