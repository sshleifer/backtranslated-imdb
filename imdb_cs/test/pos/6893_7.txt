I saw 'I Smell the Dead' - I apologize to 'I SELL the Dead' - at the press screening. Glenn McQuaid, a writer-director, director of the film, is a graceful Irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that - even though he is in progress - he will be "pinting". I don't bother him with a drink, but - if we tell us about it - he seemed to feel he needed to confirm his laddishness or his Irish, or both. When the initial credits were rolling, they were - as usual on the press screenings - loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who had friends in the audience, and silence for those who didn't. McQuaid then returned for a witty Q&A. This horror movie is not taken seriously, which is good because its humor is significantly stronger than its horror. Only one scene is scary, and most of the horror films are just rough, but I was laughing at most of the movie. This film seems to take place in Ireland around 1850 (which time crime was mostly extinct). The story is told in flashback: we get flashbacks in flashbacks, and telling flashback characters he couldn't know, because sometimes he was absent or (in one case) because the action unfolds behind his back. br /> <br /> The story begins with a prisoner taken to the guillotine. Guillotines were not used in Ireland in the 19th century, but - once - we actually see a credible guillotine sequence. The prisoner is fighting on the road to execution, the rope blocks are accurate, and the prisoner can look up to see the blade above his head. (And there is also a reward later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself.) The characters are seemingly Irish, but one main character speaks in Cockney Slang: use phrases like "mug game" and "take a butcher" "(For 'have a look'). 19th century actors exhibit 19th century dental hygiene, but almost all clothing and hairstyles (and women's makeup) are definitely the 21st century. I'm not complaining about the case of Heather Bullock who wears a very charming black miniskirt cozzie that seems to be PVC. Phworr! Major actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of them have no sense of Victorian times. The worst offender is Joel Garland as a publisher whose character is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. Just when I thought that Garland's performance couldn't be less Victorian, he used his fingers to create "ironic" air quotes. <br /> <br /> The kits (especially the Angus Scrimm lab) are detailed and impressive. I wasn't convinced that people in these places actually lived and worked. Almost every interior contains burning candles, but I have never seen what would have been there if it were real Victorian houses or workplaces: the remaining drops from the previous candles. One scene has an extraterrestrial: I was upset that McQuaid rushed for the stereotypical "gray" alien Schwa, rather than something original. There are splendid montage edits, but McQuaid decides on splendid effects - split-screen, overhead shots - that doesn't serve the story. I was impressed by the repetitive blue screen that overlapped the heads of the main characters over another background. The less effective was the repetitive motif of "Creepshow" photographic shots of morphing actors face into drawings reminiscent of panel art from the 1950s. I am a fan of EC Comics, but I do not belong to Ireland in the 19th century. The money McQuaid spent on a fantasy photo of F / X - showing off his editing skills without serving the story - should be spent on accurate costumes. BIG SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives "Oirish" performance full of school actors. He apparently plays a 19th century Irish priest and writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, left-handed children were punished using "devil's hand" and were forcibly retrained to become lawyers.) But Perlman's character turns out to have a reason to cover up his right hand. Elsewhere, the character is bitten by zombies but suffers from no bad effects, so I knew there would be a payday later. Several scenes that logically take place at night are filmed in daylight, apparently just because it was easier and cheaper. (Since McQuaid is a proficient director and editor, he could easily have made a "night-time" ... but, with a process-shooting effect that would help him tell a story, he is much less interested in it than demonstrating his opulent editing techniques. ) <br /> <br /> McQuaid seems to be paying tribute to the great old Hammer horror swings. But the hammers were so great that the actors and the producers tried to convince us that we had witnessed the events of 1888 Whitechapel or anywhere. 'I Sell the Dead' almost does not invoke the 19th century. Glenn McQuaid shows talent as a director, scripter and editor, but in all three capacities he makes special choices ... then he does not justify these choices for the most part. But I enjoyed 'I Sell the Dead'. I will rate it 7 out of 10 and look forward to his next film.
