Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, half man, half vampire known as daywalker. He has all his strength and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Because he has teamed up with a whistle (Kris Kristofferson), he has hunted vampires who have been unnoticed between us for centuries, but the almighty ruler Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with people (food as he calls them) and plans to awaken the blood god and take control of the world. This film is well-cast, written and directed; Ensure that the spectator has an exciting ride from start to finish. A package with great battle sequences and neat dialogue, Blade is certainly more action than horror, but it definitely brings. <br /> <br /> 8/10
