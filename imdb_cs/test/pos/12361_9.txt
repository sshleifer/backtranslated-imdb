The last person who dies before the New Year is cursed to run the Phantom Carriage all year, picking up the souls of the dead. I saw the scene from this old, quiet Swedish horror movie on Youtube, and decided to track down the whole movie. It was well worth finding a job because it's a totally amazing movie for the time it was made. It has a beautifully frightening atmosphere. The old horror makers knew how to create a perfect atmosphere. Sadly, many of today's filmmakers have not understood how important the settings and the atmosphere are and go for cheap fears. Visual effects are excellent relative to date of production. If you can find a copy of this, I highly recommend putting your watch. 9/10
