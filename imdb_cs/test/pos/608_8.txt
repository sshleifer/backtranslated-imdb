Naruse is typically considered to be one of 3 Japanese filmmakers, the other two are Oz and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest movie about retired geisha. Whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her magic and mysticism? For those interested, watch this movie. One: Okin, he is successful as a lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are upset. Okin has no children but others. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to see her and is excited. Naruse is a master in the subtle studies of female protagonists. Bangiku ultimately attracts the viewer to study the issues of happiness and life. Very good movie.
