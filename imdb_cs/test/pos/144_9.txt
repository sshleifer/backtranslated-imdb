The priest, in deep love and suffering, has not shown the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has beautiful human beauty (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love for Femme fatale is notorious but beautiful when taking responsible death for a vampire. She did not stay deep into the lost paradise, but decided to leave the man himself. Femme but beautiful Femme fatale! This film thought me about the suffering between man and vampire, far beyond the priest and salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but for this Adam (priest), dedicated and responsible, to take Eve up from the Lost Paradise, the vampire world. Another symphonic poem by Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost.
