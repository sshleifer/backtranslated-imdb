There was a recent documentary on the production of films that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what his likes to do movies. One common theme was that you can have a great script, great cast, best director and a lot of money and still create a bad movie. Down Periscope is proof of this theory. It's not an original or terribly well-written script. Several solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to say that Kelsey Grammar was carrying this movie, but that really is not the case. Other actors, such as Rob Schneider, and the hilarious Harland Williams, have contributed significantly to the enjoyment of the film. The cast of dynamics, or that mysterious "magic movie" is really what happened here, and created a movie that goes smoothly, has incredibly well done transitions and a line after the line of well-written and well-executed dialogue. A powerful assumption, a lot of technical inaccuracies and just a plan of stupid things that couldn't become a real world or a real navy, but you don't care. As a merchant sailor myself, I found that the overall feeling of the film, although not credible, was also not too far from the mark in terms of life at sea. This is a very funny movie, a good family movie, and especially if your fan, a lot of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn funniness.
