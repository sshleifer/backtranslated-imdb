I enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. Director Sheldon Cohen and Narrator Roch Carrier perfectly captured all the boy's emotions. From the feelings he had for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, expectation and hope that he would soon win the new Montreal Canadiens sweater, to the expression of horror on his face when he took his sweater from his mother; The Toronto Maple Leafs Sweater was priceless and a shame to wear this horrible (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; It's not rouge, bleu and blanc from Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, as well as his old sweater. And worst of all, his mom forced him to wear this Maple Leafs sweater from home. You can imagine and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he encounters ice that wears the sweater before he got there. I've been laughing all the time and that's one of the best animated movies I saw. <br /> <br />
