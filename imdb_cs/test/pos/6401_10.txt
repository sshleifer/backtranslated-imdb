It seems we all agree. It was a great show and let it die before time. I decided that when I like the show, it's often a kiss of death. I love the unpredictable, file cast show and great environment always helps. I was really expecting to see a lot of these stars in other TV productions, but in short Mariska Hagartay, who played Fisher Stephens' crazy girlfriend, I didn't see many of them, except for occasional portrait roles. What a shame. Key West, Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all the great shows, all unfortunately before their time. <br /> <br /> Hear us out loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
