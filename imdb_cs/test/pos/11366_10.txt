I watched this whole series when I was a child at primary school, as chosen, not because it was necessary for school. I read the games at the pace of the series. Experience has brought me a lifelong love of Shakespeare and history. She even gave me a bit of an acting bug, though only on an amateur level. Every time I read some of Shakespeare's history, the first images are from this black-and-white production, seen on the big "furniture" television with the rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and the waves that go with Although the files were minimal, if I remember correctly, it was completely irrelevant because the acting was so good. At that time, I had no idea who the actors were. Now I see that many of them have become well known over the years. I especially enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, which I now see Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would like to see this available in the video eagerly, especially since many games are rarely done and even less available on video. It would also be valuable as a documentary from the mid-20th century television production.
