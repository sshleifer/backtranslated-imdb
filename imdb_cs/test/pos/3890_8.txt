Garlin did a great job. Nice concept well made and firmly made. He came as a very honest story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm," where Jeff was largely a straight man role, I was pleased to see how much depth he had brought in this simple but effective image. Much of this humor was undervalued and subtle and drew on the honesty that I really liked, rather than being grotesque or exaggerated. And there were a few nice surprises and twists. Self-service vignette was a pleasure. <br /> <br /> When I say it's a wonderful "little" movie, I don't mean budget or quality. It's simple, intimate and hand crafted. This tells a very plausible daily story. Relax and go look. Let yourself be washed over you and feel good about doing so.
