I saw Anatomy when he came out and recently bought and continued in 2003 and as I watch a lot of foreign movies in different genres, you have to watch movies in their original language for sure. Not only is it uncomfortable to know that voices do not belong to actors, but they always seem cheerful, as the whole movie is one big long toothpaste commercial or something. This makes an otherwise amazing movie seem horrible and I had to transfer a lot of my friends who thought that foreign movies aren't as good as North American movies - that they aren't "Hollywood enough". Also, the translation is never correct, it's too literal, and screwing up the atmosphere of the movie, even if it basically says the same thing. I watched Anatomy myself for the second week in German and then headlines with my roommate because he was on his laptop and didn't want to miss parts when he didn't see the headlines because he wrote. 30 minutes and he begged me to let him finish his work and then started a subtitle movie. He loved it! Both movies are amazing as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
