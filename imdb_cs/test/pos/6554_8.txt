Uzumaki (this is Japanese for "spirals" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd movies I've ever watched. The city becomes obsessed and then consumed by the vortex pattern in some very grotesque ways. Fingers are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wild and crazy Japanese horror. Perhaps as psychologically harmful as the "Ring". Generally not as scary as the "eye", but the picture in this is more outrageous than most things in "The Eye". And not as cruelly as "Untold Story" ... but that doesn't mean there's not enough blood and burst. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horror movies - you need to add this movie to your list. Several parts are a little strange with sound effects (the story is modified from manga comics and shows), but really suits. Unlike some of the films that try to capture the original source ("The House of the Dead"), it does it perfectly. The most original movie you will see ... not only this year, but probably at all. Recommended!
