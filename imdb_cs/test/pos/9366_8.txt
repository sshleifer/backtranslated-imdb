Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" is a rare film originating from the 1940s Hollywood. This was the groundbreaking territory for Mr. Dmytryka and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel in which the film was based. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading it now. Richard Brooks's novel was about homosexual killing. In the film, the subject was turned to prejudices against Jews, a theme that was taboo during that time in the American cinema. It is thanks to Mr. Dmytryk that he has the courage to get involved in this film project. The film is an excellent film work because the director presents it. Apparently influenced by film noir style, we are admitted to Washington after the war. The opening scene of the brutal murder of Samuel shows such an unusual cruelty that was caused to a decent person we don't yet know, or why he was killed, but who didn't deserve to die in such a terrible way. > <br /> The basis of the murder is prejudice, clean and simple. We realize how in the mind of the unconscious man, the mere fact that he is successful and different, he plays in the mind of a killer. Samuels stands as a sacrificial lamb, just as a gay soldier is a victim in a novel. Parallels are well drawn. This film is a convincing view because a great star turned to Robert Ryan as Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as well as in "Crossfire". Also there is a great look of Gloria Grahame, like Ginny, a prostitute with a heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast plays as a file. As a police investigator, Robert Young is a respectable person who knows first-hand prejudices in his own family and speaks loudly against him. Robert Mitchum plays great Sgt. Keeley, who is deeply touched by crime when one of his men is accused of committing a crime. Sam Levene is excellent in his little role as Samuel. This is a movie that is watching because it is probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance.
