In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) is twenty-four years old and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association that advocates freedom of choice, led by his friend Gene (Clara Segur). Ramón is introduced to a lawyer who advocates his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), which has a degenerative fatal disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lone worker the men have abused. Their relationship is changing behavior and the life of Rosa and Juliet. Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors. His Brazilian filmography is composed of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Other" and "Mar Adentro". Presently, Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain. Their association created this sensitive drama about a very polemical subject, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never exhausted or depressing because the scenario uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The cast's performances are perfect, with characters having and defending different positions about this unpleasant theme. Dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noted in the IMDb chart that this film is based on Ramón Sampedro's real story. Unfortunately, neither this movie nor the DVD provide this important information. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
