This is a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's a fun, and vaguely feel-good movie. The smaller but irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke up. Okay, most of the first relationships don't work for one reason or another, but more or less it seemed like a nice couple. In short, it is worth looking at how to escape reality.
