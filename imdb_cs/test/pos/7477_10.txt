This film was excellent from start to finish. I was riveted by action, black humor, and incredibly bad luck with our hero at every turn. Thomas Jane is a great actor and I hope to see him in many other movies. Reading through other people's comments, I must admit that I've never thought about Tarrantino while watching "Thursday" but now that I think there are some similarities. I think I don't care to connect everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizo ​​and Thomas Jane is one of the record books - a sexy scene.
