IMDb forces reviewers to write a certain number of links, but I really want to say - "This is an incredible movie, and you can't consider yourself a movie fan without seeing it." You should just trust me on this and stop reading this review and get the movie and push the game. But I have to write something. Let me emphasize the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge includes what can still be the most successful and best performance in Crispin Glover, and if you watched Crispin Glover you don't know that it justifies it to be 10. Funny lines galore. (2) River's Edge includes Dennis Hopper's second most memorable performance (other than Blue Velvet). ), and it's really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge is the best Keanu Reeves career and is excellent. It was the role he was born. He has a lot of good lines, but one is really really funny. Listen close when his character and step-father talk together. <br /> <br /> Still the best Stoner movie, that's much more than that. It tends to show up in dramatic parts of movie-rental shops, but if it's drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.
