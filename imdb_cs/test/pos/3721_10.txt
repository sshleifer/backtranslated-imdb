If you expect this movie to be full of action and grab you from the start, don't look at it. But if you like those kinds of meditative movies that keep in your mind for a while until you get the details, then you'll love it. Now don't get me wrong, it's action and things just happen not in the usual way. Basically, there is a conspiracy in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone fights in their (or their) way of survival. They lost their ability to speak in this fight ... I don't want to write more to spoil the movie, but believe me if you like SF-authors like Lem or Capec or even some of the Orson Scott Card love this movie.
