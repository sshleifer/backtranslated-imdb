I can't understand why life is so low for life. That was one of the most beautiful movies I saw this year. It really occurred to me. I was expecting this film a few months ago and I thought it could by no means meet the expectations I had for him ... to see how I put it in my head just as I did. Needless to say, not only did it meet my expectations, but it surpassed them far. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Their performances by far. Both were in their element and completely natural for roles. The locations were beautiful. Each shot was perfectly captured and beautifully fit into the mood and atmosphere. I found the movie very moving and took it very close to heart. I'd even think it might be one of my favorite favorites. At least I can see it again and again. I swear I couldn't find one mistake in this movie. It's hard to say about a movie. I highly recommend this. It is touching, it makes sense and says a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
