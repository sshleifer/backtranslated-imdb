Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare. How could they know so much about the inner functioning of palace life. Here as in the West Wing, Sorkin opens a surprising door that is hardly shocking, but seems to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time directly responsible for the lives of many people. Angry Tom Hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions, but without considering the implications, and Julia Roberts reminds us of the powers hidden in the sidebar in her blonde southern hairstyle. The subject is serious, but the treatment is light, intelligent, but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as an invisible middle-aged man, steals every scene he is in, just as Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in. Dialogue is fast, but not fast enough not to touch and find that it's not an ordinary comedy. A seemingly casual pace of filled joke and provocation strokes gives Mike Nicholas another badge of honor.
