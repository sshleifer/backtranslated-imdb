Toy soldiers is a fine action movie, but what really stands out is the amount of effort that screenwriters and director put into portraying American anti-terrorist forces accurately. Just look at the final credits - there are more than a dozen US military officers and officials on the list. The film accurately depicts the FBI as having control of the hostage situation, but turning it over the US Army's Delta Force (who are unnamed in the film as the Pentagon was still denying their existence at this time) once the president renounced Posse Commitatus Act US code. US Army forces at the end are precisely dressed and armed. And even the use of the AH-64 Apache for air support - which might seem a little over the top - is not terribly unrealistic. Far more expensive and frankly better films portrayed US counter-terrorism forces with much less precision.
