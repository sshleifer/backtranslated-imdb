We'll start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 films in the last 15 years. Recently, we have been honored to receive a lifetime film going into any movie at any time for free! So we can see what we want whenever we want. The thing is that CRITICS is for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to see hundreds of movies, whether they want it or not. Therefore, our belief is that if you get your money for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER hear or read criticism. We only care about our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Well enough about that. When Meryl Streep, head of the NSC in the film, says, "The United States will not do torture", this film was a big laugh. It is, of course, a lie the Bush administration has repeatedly denied. It's a very good movie and it's scary in what they can do when we lose all our civil rights. They can just "catch you" anywhere and say they did. In this case, grab a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. Of course he is just like you or me. Very frightening. Well behaved Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
