I saw the Border a few years ago at AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was scary: visual, textural, sensual. This film took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget that the curtain is blowing in the wind. I still remember how it tilted my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw him. I didn't know what happened when the movie was over, but life is like that. That didn't bother me. The injustice of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character interferes with me as sadly real. I loved the faces, the way the camera rested on them. The camera was looking at the television set with defocused eyes of the dreamer. The border was real to me in the way films are not. It was the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made him enter my consciousness as a thief at night. I love this movie. I'll own it once.
