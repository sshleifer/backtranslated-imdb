I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie. They are the stars of two gorgeous actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, which when I heard they were in the movie together I watch it. The moments where I felt as if they were trying hard, and there was also some really exaggerated and worn out material, but there was nothing in the film that I absolutely hated. Uncredited Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments are moving and effective. If you want to watch this movie, keep going, because although I don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and 5.9 seems to me to be unfair.
