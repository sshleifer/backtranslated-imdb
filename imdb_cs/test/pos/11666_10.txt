In a world where controversial and misunderstood subjects can be discussed indefinitely, this powerful 1995 film is at the top of this list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, with sensitivity and sensitivity that makes it a really great film by one's measuring rod. And to all this, he added irony, and the subject of this film was widely misunderstood because it was misunderstood to be a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; It's not. In the heart of "Dead Man Walking", director Tim Robbins, there is a topic that is perhaps perhaps the most misunderstood of all, and with a good reason, because it can be the most difficult thing that is really real for a human being. - And really ... understand. And that's what this movie actually is about: Forgiveness. Real Forgiveness; not to excuse the abominable crime or its perpetrators - not to say that what has happened is fine - but to find the strength to go on and do so by choosing life. Director / screenwriter Tim Robbins has created and delivered a faithful adaptation of Helena Prejean's novel, in which she discusses her engagement with the death prisoner whom she has served her faith in God over the years. As the film tells us what it was like to become a lifelong effort not only for justice but for human dignity, it began with a simple letter from the death prisoner at a Louisiana prison in a state prison in Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) approached anyone who listened when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself in the territory she got. he had no knowledge or experience. And Robbins successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey while keeping her free of any maudlin sentiment that makes her not only real, trustworthy and credible, but also turns her into a touching and thoroughly emotional experience for the audience. Through the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for anyone who sees this film as well. For her soul-exciting, passionate portrait of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon has deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actress. Sensitive and full of emotional depth, her performance is incredibly moving and real, especially in the way she mediates Nurse Prejean's basic natural fragility and vulnerability, which she admirably mitigated with the tenacity she needed to continue her efforts on behalf of Poncelet (and in total five when she started). No matter what your opinion is about the issues explored in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly the unit of heroic proportions that Sarandon has greatly personified here; and does so without resorting to redundant melodramas, but rather by keeping them in real, gentle and humble exploration of humanity in a very believable expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary feat, probably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. The best performance in his career is also Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrait of Poncelet (lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in Leaving). Las Vegas). Perfect for this part in every way, Penn has never been better before or since. Poncelet effectively presents itself as a real person rather than an exaggerated caricature of a monster capable of committing the crimes described here. Not that it makes Poncelet less despicable; exactly opposite. It makes it really disturbing to be confronted with the fact that someone who looks like a person who could live next to you could be able to do such things. And that is the power of Penn's performance - it is so disturbingly real, presented with depth and subtlety; You have to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of the restless soul. Great performance and - as good as Cage in "Vegas" - Penn was supposed to receive an Oscar. Raymond J. Barry is unforgettable in the next stand-out show. supporting role as Earl Delacroix, the father of one of Ponceleta's victims. However, with a limited screening time, he develops his character in a way that empowers him as well as Sister Prejean, because it makes him look at how complicated and seemingly subtle his position is. , at least on the surface. Barry introduces Delacroix in a way that gives the story the necessary balance and perspective that is ultimately extremely effective and helps underline the film's message. Supporting cast includes Clyde Percy, Mary Beth Percy, Lois Smith, Scott Wilson, Lucille Poncelet, Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change the opinion of someone one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended was to create a provocative, emotionally-active film, which is exactly what Robbins did with "Dead Man Walking." Regardless of your personal opinion, this film will have an impact, and hopefully opens some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. Because, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that one chooses to decide, but it is a task that can become a lifelong work. And it is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life that can be achieved effectively; and you give up this film with recognition for individuals like Sister Prejean, who selflessly dedicated her life to helping people in need and filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon to bring it to the lives of millions who would otherwise never know her. I rate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
