The stupid proverb "You can't touch it" is certainly true here. With all the horror clones and sci-fi movies coming out, along with all the lower remakes, it's hard to find anything worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared me when I was a preschooler. Things are without any doubt in my mind the bloodiest, most beautiful sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry even Mr. Spielberg) ever did. But what gives him strength is not gore (it is slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the feeling of horror, isolation and distrust that the characters and viewer support. > <br /> You can't go further than Antarctica and in this howling where the story takes place is a chilling white environment. There are several Americans, researchers and military men. One day they are witnessing a Siberian husky dog ​​running for life from the Norwegians' guns. Before they know it, the American base is fighting a mysterious creature that can mimic any creature it wants. It can morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's done, but once it ends, if you haven't seen it during, you can't tell it between people or other normal Earth animals. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few great games. This movie is why horror can be a great genre. Actually, it scares me. Alien blood "jumping" from a petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes a jump !!! <br /> <br /> Still the most horrible of them.
