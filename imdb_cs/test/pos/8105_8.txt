I once captured about 20 minutes of this movie on Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought there was gold every minute I watched, and because it was somewhere in the middle of the movie, and I didn't want to mess up the whole thing if I watched it from the beginning, I decided to borrow it right away. Well, the video rental I didn't often have had a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had before that experience just saw some Chaplin shorts, funny, but not very sophisticated, but after I saw an excerpt from The Great Dictator, I looked at three of his other movies, City Lights, Gold Rush and Modern Times (City) . The lights were great, I found that the Gold Rush was a bit overestimated, but still worth it, and I found that Modern Times is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (more precisely, the funniest, behind Sherlock Jr. Keaton) . Finally, the whole Great Dictator, to be honest, had his moments, both comedy and drama, but these moments don't always mix well. melodrama (City Lights is the best example), but it has not always worked with social commentary, plus the fact that dialogue has been reduced by Chaplin's talent. whole, but I thought it had little effect. Unless it's over. The last speech the Jewish barber gives is extremely powerful. Yes, it is addressed tempora et mores from 1940, but today's message is perfectly applicable to the world. This speech brought me to tears and I consider it one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
