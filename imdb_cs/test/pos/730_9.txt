Nemesis Game is a stunning movie full of puzzles, death, mystery and philosophy. In its simplest sense, the film is about finding answers and what happens when you finally find them. Finding answers leads Sarah Novak to a journey that becomes darker as he gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than worth it, but Sarah is so close to understanding it. What would you do if you had the chance to finally give meaning to the confusion of life? The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although it was Warn's first feature film, the film does not reflect it at all, but instead shows a Polish and artistic approach to storytelling. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed it to be a difficult aspect. I would certainly like to see more of her work. Being based on riddles is a very cerebral movie. This is your thing as it is mine, then I recommend seeing the Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
