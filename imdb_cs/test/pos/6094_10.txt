In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story stretches across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert areas it is set against. It is a film that thinks that one does not choose love, but that it is love that chooses, no matter who, where or when; and moreover, it is a matter of the heart often dependent on prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so the situation in the English patient, directed by Anthony Minghell, is the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most intractable places and times, proving that when destined, love finds its way. It's WWII; flying over the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for enemy aircraft. And even if he survives the crash, he is heavily burned. But to his great fortune he is saved by a tribe of nomads and ends up in a hospital. However, the existing conditions are governed by the circumstances of the war and Almasa soon becomes one of many patients who are transported by convoy to another facility. After reaching Italy, he is too weak and sick to continue, and Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers, stays with him in an abandoned monastery. Hana soon finds out that her accusation is something that is a mysterious man, because Almasy doesn't remember anything about her past, nor her own name. The idea of ​​being English, the only clues pointing to who he is to be contained in the book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as the Hana patients. Slowly, but under the challenge of Hana, Almasy begins to remember the pieces and pieces of his life and his story begins to develop. And his memory is helped by an even more mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who suspects that Almasy is the man he was looking for - the man he wants to balance with. But Almasy may or may not be such a man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue on the surface; Memories of the Woman He Loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - and Memories of Katherine's Husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And these memories, which are mutilated in mind and body, become the only thing he can hold on to any hope, even though his life seems to be moving away from the moment. In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote a script for this film, which he edited from Michael Ondaatje's novel. The result is an epic saga introduced in the Lean's tradition of 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'; a wonderful movie that fills the screen and senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is brilliant; created and delivered with poetic perfection, watching them like watching Monet come alive. From the introductory frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell on his audience, which is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equates engagingly stunning and vivid images revived by the remarkable John Seal cinema; Images that virtually fill the screen and soul of the viewer. In every sense, it is a film of rare eloquence, with a remarkable emotional ability that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. Appointed in twelve categories, he has deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Binoche and Cinematography. If one had to choose one word to describe the "essence" of this film it would be "perfection". However, not even an extraordinary film will receive nine Oscars without performance that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas transcend 'Oscar Worthy'. Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasa (Geoffrey Rush won gold for "Shine"), Fiennes was never better, reaching the emotional depth with his character, which is almost palpable. Almasy, private and introspective, is not by nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to create intimate connections; But Fiennes will find a way to open these emotional doors just to guide you enough to taste the sincere passion that is in it. And it works. Almasy is not looking for your friendship; but he gets compassion. Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand won "Fargo") for her portrait of Katherine, a woman whose wife Stoic Face masks the emotional conflict that rages in her he was born in a forbidden passion that enslaves her, yet he willingly sets out to discard the shackles of repression to accept love so strong that it can be consumed. Reserve Katherine must keep evoking the audience's empathy as Scott Thomas successfully misses the emotional depth of her character in the greatest possible effect. It is a kind of exercise that draws you and holds you fast, taking you as beyond the scope of this hypocrisy curtain, which determines what needs to be done in terms of externalities and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Kristin Scott Thomas is underrated and overshadowed by the subtle impression. Binoche gives stunning performance as well as the kind sister Hana; in fact, it is her humanity that defines love in the purest sense and offers a balanced view of it in the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a glimpse of a passion of another kind that effectively contrasts with the intensity between Almasy and Katherine. An "English Patient" is a film that moves you and emotionally fills you; one you won't want to see the end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
