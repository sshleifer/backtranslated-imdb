First I saw Love in Limbo play late for a free TV broadcast about five years ago, and since then it's a movie I'll always remember warmly as one of those movies you see and are forever affected. For the uninitiated, Australian film has a long history of making off-beat comedy about loving losers, and Love in Limbo is a great example. While Russel Crowe is the only actor in him (though it's all he needs today in film), the rest of the Aussie cast is good - he still steals the show as nervous, stupid, virgin defeated though. The general assumption is much like American Pie. A group of friends who want to be reputed and become men. As you would expect, the whole film focuses on this subject (with a partial plot about the lead mother and various other incidents) and is full of humorous situations that move it towards the inevitably sweet end. If you enjoyed American Pie, don't expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to make you seem. Love in Limbo is not a rough romantic comedy - but it certainly has its share of laughter, infantry when a good guy wins, and situations where every guy, Australian or other, can relate. <br /> <br /> See if you liked: American cake, almost famous. Strengths: Good Aussie cast, easy to apply, good value perv. Weaknesses: Predictable in points. My rating: 8 of 10
