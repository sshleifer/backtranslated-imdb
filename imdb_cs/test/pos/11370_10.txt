I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember being absolutely brilliant and convincing. At that time, I did not know any of the British actors in the series, but since then I have learned that some of today's stars appear in it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in the love "among many other roles" and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating "up / down" but also excellent in many acting roles). Like another commentator, I'd like to see it again. I hope it will or will be released on VHS or DVD, if you have a chance to see it, don't miss it.
