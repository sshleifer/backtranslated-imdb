That was another big episode from the 11 South Park season. Cartman counterfeits with Tourette Syndrome so they can tell what they want without getting into trouble. He is able to swear to other children at school. Kyle tells Principal that Cartman pretends. But they don't believe it. Chris Hansen plans that Cartman will talk about Tourette's live and uncensored syndrome at Dateline. But later, Cartman begins to be so addicted to be able to say anything he wants that he later starts to randomly say embarrassing things. That was a funny episode of Cartman, who shows Tourette's syndrome. I recommend it to all South Park fans.
