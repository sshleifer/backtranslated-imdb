I raced into the library to see these miniseries after I just finished listening to the amazing "spoken book" in the full version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really very good, but in the second half it will break up a bit. The relationship with the confidant is overpowered and conflicts between Jean and Joe, which do not exist in Shute's story, are wisely in my opinion because they greatly reduce the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that Joan Joe's amazing Bryan Brown looked much more funny and much less appealing than the man in the book, but Jean Jean was really good. I think they would have to do a 10-hour miniseries to get a proper story about the outback. But all I said, I watched the whole thing more or less once and appreciated her merits all the time he wanted someone to make a less soap remake.
