Despite several acceptable adaptations to the main themes of the books, QUEEN OF DAMNED / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT did not remain true to Anne Rices' complicated narrative. The deep layers that make up all the characters were crushed only on their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events in the film seemed to be distorted and uneven. However, there were quite a few things that the film deserved my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the influence that Lestat (among other vampires) had the public, especially the young girls. The film also did a pretty good job of focusing on the importance of heredity and history that vampires take pride in. The sensuality scenes were also atmospherically satisfying. The actress in QUEEN OF DAMNED was mild if she was disappointed. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have surprising chemistry, although it only shows when acting is at best (not too often). The characters are nothing compared to the characters set in INTERVIEW WITH VAMPIRE. She also lacks the emotional intelligence of the HIGHER WORLD, which is a shame because Rice's queen of the damned book had it and more. This movie doesn't give everything that seems to be. The effects are boring and very unsatisfactory. Extravagance needed in many scenes is not given and dialogue is tedious. Setting up for many scenes is not the way I imagined it in the book, and I think many of them have not even been taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps quite fairly, giving the viewer a full story (if they haven't read the book). Somethings that I feel the film needs a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) instead of a rock music mix; although I had no problem with some songs. Another thing that would make the film better is a better direction setting. The scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves quite often. Overall, QUEEN OF DAMNED was an uneven disappointment but a somewhat satisfying adaptation of an important novel. With a few simple changes it could have been a very successful work of the film. I would recommend this movie to people who have seen INTERVIEW, or have read books to express themselves on their own opinion.
