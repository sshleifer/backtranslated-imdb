I would give this film high marks for cinematography and performance. I just read the user's commentary on the actress's performance, which plays the pleasing courtesan who embodies Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember this actress's mini-biography after the movie when I last saw her. She was apparently a Holocaust refugee who was discovered by a French husband and wife in the film industry who were married to her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also excellent in this movie. Like other neo-biblical films of the '40s and' 50s, 'Egyptian' reflects the morals and values ​​of that time, but it is still great fun, because the performances are amazing and the story so well said.
