Let's face it. This film is incredibly clich√© because Korean romantic drama and movies go. First, there are a few long-lost siblings, one of whom falls in love with another. Secondly, he's a not-so-popular girl and two wonderful, popular guys who fall and fight for her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness that eventually takes his life. Nevertheless, I like this movie. Without the right actors, this movie would probably disappoint the fans of this novel. But because the actors fit perfectly into the roles, the film is riveting - I couldn't honestly stop watching. Despite his pretty face, Kang Dong Won gives amazing, cordial performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, plus all supporting actors. Definitely I would recommend this movie to everyone.
