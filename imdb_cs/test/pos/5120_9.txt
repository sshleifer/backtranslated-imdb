I watched this movie just because I didn't want to leave my 9 years old and my friend in the theater alone. I honestly went in the expectation of being able to enjoy a good nap - but I was in the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was on one of my favorite TV shows years ago and played Mermaid (Maximum Bob). She was really cute in this movie. The three main characters were all outstanding young actors. He also enjoyed seeing and hearing Jimmy Buffet. The film itself was pretty beautiful - showing some of what makes Florida so great. I'm glad I ended up in this movie. And to think, I was disappointed that I couldn't take them to see "Stick It" - I think it was much better!
