This movie was my favorite and is involved in Christmas for two reasons: (1) growing up in the sixties, everything was spatially dependent on television program advertising and even Santa Claus found himself in space ships during that year era; and (2) I saw this movie during a Christmas shopping trip when I was 10 years old and brought back memories of my favorite TV shows when I was younger ("Supercar", Fireball XL5 "and" Stingray "). this movie for personal reasons, i'm so pre-biased. <br /> <br /> As a long-time student of film, it's mainly a movie for Gerry Anderson fans (and Barry Gray, oh, that wonderful score!) films will be discouraged by future vision of the past (digging wild cars, commercial planes, clothes, etc.) and the so-called "conspiracy conspiracy" that will make some moan, but if you can watch around post- "2001: Space Odyssey" The desire to make a sci-fi movie with a "far" story, and if you like imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem of the era when a man just walked on the moon and people still stared at the stars in miracles and hope into the future, rather than looking down on the banal traps of the current 21st century.
