It's just one of those movies, either you love it or you hate it, my girlfriend and I loved it, they told my brother that he rented it and he hated it, said it was too flashy and colloquial, then usually just walks To see great action movies, so probably not enough blasts to disappoint him. Were there any great new talents (I've never heard of leadership)? Des Brady (the director's brother?) He was especially good. At the beginning, I thought he would never buy, but he managed to climb out of the dark hole he had made, and in the end I really directed him. Very surprising movie with a lot of heart, if you can live without body counting and explosions, then this is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.
