It must be one of the worst movies of all time. A kind of title that destroys the film because it does not even evoke the plot or the characters. The title is like a movie flop, not even a French title is much better. Damage - Truffaut & Deneuve must be enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it's pretty much worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal bride, her rich husband, theft, identity switch and obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good, and it takes us on an unexpected trip. The thing that works both for and against film is a focus on relationship. It's an interesting study of how these conspiracies of development take place in a "real life relationship" with these two people. Unfortunately, this is what bogs the film down and makes it eventually dissatisfied. We love movies that have a real sense of finality, and that's missing here. In many of her films, Deneuve has become a screen for directors to play their fantasies. this time it doesn't work the same. There is a fact that the director clearly wanted Deneuve to marry her top several times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems thoughtful and thoughtful, so these attempts at her appearance seem spontaneous. <br /> <br /> In principle, the scenario needs to be better handled before the start of the shoot so that the film becomes stronger and shorter and captured. But Truffaut didn't click, did he? So - it's a little wandering, but it's interesting.
