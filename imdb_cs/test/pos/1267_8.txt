This is an excellent movie, but Momento (another big movie of Nolan) is much better. I would recommend people go see Momento and then if they like it, see this movie. The film is filmed in black and white, which I was a little angry with, but once in a movie that you understand black and white is the best way to see the movie. It is extremely graspable and reasonably easy to understand, although the way it is created is very clever. The elements of the story I think are a little stupid, but the movie is definitely worthy of a second viewing. To make sure the movie has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good gameplay, and with regard to the movie's budget, I have to say it's pretty amazing.
