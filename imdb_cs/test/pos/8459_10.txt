I normally don't have comments on IMDB movies, but in this case I feel like I should. I love movies and I want to do them and this film is a perfect example of fine art. This is one of the few movies I've seen on a small screen on the AMC, I believe, and then on the DVD that I've just watched) that I get that feeling in my stomach pit. The little stupid feeling the director hopes to feel while watching his thriller. Jack Lemmon's performance is great, followed by Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. I felt the empathy of Lemmon, who is the character of Jack Godell, just wanted people to listen to his warnings. But what impresses me most about this movie is the lack of score, and that's also what's beautiful for me. In addition to the introductory titles, there is no background music to increase tension because none is needed. And while credits are running, white on a black background, it's quietly where you are at home. <br /> <br /> I use the film as an example for anyone who says music makes a movie. I think the film should make a movie and the music should only amplify it. But for The China Syndrome it is not necessary to overcome realism and the urgency shown here. The characters show all these much better than the music ever could. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. If you like movie soundtracks more, you may not want to give this one a go.
