I just want to say that this film was excellent. I loved it from start to finish. Acting was great. The director did a great job and would like to see it again. Jennifer Tilly did a very good job, the guy who interpreted his father (Manny) was another great actor but I can't RECALL HIS NAME. I can't wait for El Padrino II. Damian Chap looks so good and I think he's one of the most talented actors. There is a pleanty of Latin actors who do a great job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
