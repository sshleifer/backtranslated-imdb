For me, this magnificent rollercoaster film carries repetitive pleasing looks. It's about the tangled lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is an obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays an unprecedented but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is a nice but stupid new guy on the block, news anchor. The classic love triangle emerges with the stunning, funny and suicidal Brookes in love with Hunter, but of course is attracted to Hurt. This film works on many levels. At least it is a great one-liner comedy that flies so densely and fast that every observation carries the new harvest of the ones you missed last. It is also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance. But most importantly, the film explores the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valuable human attribute. This is embodied in the meteoric career success of Hurt's character, unlike Brookes' relative decline. Despite being a 15-year-old film, it has several important news about modern news values ​​and the continuing decline in journalistic standards. . This film is a classic in every sense and it's hard to understand why it was so neglected
