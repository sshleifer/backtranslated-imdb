New Yorkers recall this film as reflecting on their time and how well they occupied and addressed America, the New York City of that time. Norman Wexler's scenario distinguishes different worlds of different subgroups and Avildsen is heading for phenomenal performances all around. Peter Boyl's surreal talent has been exposed as never before and since then. Obviously, this is the best portrait portrait ever made by Dennis Patrick. I'll always remember at JOE that I was in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater. Knowing what he was portraying on the screen was something below the surface in the neighborhoods of New York's five neighborhoods. This movie needs to be remembered.
