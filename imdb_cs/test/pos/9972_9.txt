The pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism has never been an inherent problem with any "Venice Merchant" production, but the fact that there are two story lines that differ both in tone and content; frothy romantic comedy and singing tragedy. While mixing genres have been all rage in the sixteenth century (and the derided Shakespeare in Hamlet), it rarely fails to grate with a modern audience. As a result, most directors are forced to emphasize one story at the expense of another, and it is no wonder that the decision falls into the favor of Shylock. Like many of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes, Shylock is still fascinated after 400 years because he is so complex and complex. Poor, proud, angry, vindictive, weak, arrogant; his behavior resists mere analysis and is still argued. He is not defective because he is a Jew, but because he is a man. Rarely, modern screenwriters collect their creations with such richly textured opposites, and that is for anyone who has Shakespeare to draw inspiration. The Shakespeare language is wild and discontinuous, saturated with several meanings, word and metaphor. To understand this, they must be ashamed and tamed by an actor with such strength and knowledge. When the actor fails, the words are poured out into a source of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the English language rises to life with immediacy and liveliness that takes your breath away. Al Pacino is one such actor, and here he shows an incredible level of clarity and control that if there were any justice, he would sweep every award on offer. It meets the challenge of introducing Shylock's head and delivers ultra-soft and gentle performance. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he was doing with King Lear. Supportive casting is remarkable. Jeremy Irons gives an original awareness of the famous Antonio, representing an older, quieter figure who displays disgusting contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudices of time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation when he matures over the superficial eye candy to actually occupy the character once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are underwriting and require that the actor really work hard to bring them to life, and the personification of Collins' Gwyneth Paltrow seems somewhat flat and unsuitable for the darker tone Radford seeks. The design team must be recognized for creating a unique and thoroughly credible vision of the late Renaissance Venice. The city didn't look so ominous, because "Don't look now". Taking full advantage of existing locations and natural light, the film has a look of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and worn out costume. Again, they deserve awards. <br /> <br /> Prizes for such films must be rewarded. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must go to such a business in full and certain awareness that they will never make a profit and yet invest. We are all grateful for this, because the result is a remarkable adaptation that will certainly be a benchmark for many years to come.
