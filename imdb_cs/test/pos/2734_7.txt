15 Park Avenue, as well as a mystification originally from New York and a film that takes place in Kolkata. However, as the story unfolds, one is aware of the thin line that the director is attempting to pass between relationships, the social cause and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has a lot more to do and has less time. But she certainly did a good movie. In a way, we realize that each of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue '. It's an endless search in every one of us ... <br /> <br /> Shaban Azmi's powerhouse performance is a treat. Her presence on the screen brings a lot of life to the scene. It really was surprising to see her in such a mighty act after a long time because I expected it to be all the way to Konkon's Dream Terrain. Shabana feels deep from an older sister who leads the show for a rather unhappy family and almost forgets to live her own life during this time. She burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18-year-old sister (who is more like her daughter) and an aging mother playing veteran Waheed Rehman. As for the Guide's lead actress (that's how I can remember her immediately), there's nothing to say except for a few lines and drops. Even more reliable Rahul Bose plays another key role in the film, showing the emotions of a middle-aged man with penance on his face to perfection. This person really amazes me with the variety of work he has done. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and many more ?. He is one versatile, I really wish he had more shots in the first part of the movie. The camera in the film is Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks really beautiful and portrays the role of a mother of two with real ease. She gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's previous relationships. <br /> <br /> The camera was focused on the Meethi camera, shown by Konkon. She and her schizophrenic world form the core of 15 Park Avenue. She really worked hard on character, but there are times when she's not able to connect with the audience. The fateful accident of her life is trying to trap in sympathy and has been only partially successful. The film attempts to address several things, from the unique world of a person with disabilities to the unequal status of women and today's modern India, as well as twisted relationships in a torn family. . And I believe Aparna has succeeded to some extent. Meethi's helplessness, while working as a journalist in a rural eastern state, really gives us a naked picture of a country we are so proud of. Well, when I finished 15 Park Avenue, there was a feeling of incredible thirst in me. I wanted more of this movie to push me emotionally. It was a commendable effort on the part of the director, with the exception of some hiccups. He must look at all those who like to see another cinema, something with a strong purpose.
