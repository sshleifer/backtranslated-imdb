This is a film that deserves another look - if you haven't seen it for a while, or a glance - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on the game of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who toured the Shakespeare repertoire company in England during World War II. He deals with his stress trying to make Shakespeare every night to face such issues as bombed theaters and a society of elderly or physically disabled actors - young, capable of those who are drafted for military service. He also deals with his relationship to various members of his company, especially his dresser. So far it all sounds rather boring, but nothing can be further from the truth. While the tragic whole, the story is told with lots of humor and emotions running high throughout. Both men lead both Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Well Deservedly. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys human drama, theater - especially Shakespeare, or who has ever worked behind the scenes in any function. The backstage event is another aspect of the film that will be fascinating for most viewers.
