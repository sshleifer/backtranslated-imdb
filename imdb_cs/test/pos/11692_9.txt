Beauty in Trouble is not a big title. All the descriptions of this movie can't capture what it is? fairy tale for adults. The poor girl is enchanted by the prince. "Girl", Marcela, played by the stunning Anna Geisler, has the beauty of Isabelle Huppert, with red hair, face and figure that are charming, sexual and infinitely fascinating. She has an ox husband but they have great sex. Children listen to love making through the walls. It is rude and passionate, as working class sex seems to be often portrayed in film. But it is also up to us to realize that it is a thing that connects them together in an otherwise incompatible marriage. A husband, a professional car thief, is finally caught and thrown into jail. How she got into this marriage, which we don't know but is not entirely first-class. But she is beautiful, intelligent (assuming) and loves her wonderful and resilient children. He deserves more. And maybe he'll get the life he deserves - eventually. (without a spoiler!) She is forced to return with her mom after her husband is sent to prison. Mom has a nasty second husband (reading ugly stepfather). It's a real horror show. He borders on being a child of abusive children. He is obsessed with purity, but steadfastly flees at the table, and also requires children and ways from children. He is a really low class socially handicapped poor man. Mom agrees with him, just like Marcella's husband, at least he is greedy - repulsive, but horny. Ambivalent, confusing, layered characterizations are what makes the film so powerful and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seemed to be class-driven, some inherited. These mistakes and character details are glamorous for one minute and contemptuous others. The audience must really negotiate a contradictory feeling of class, sexuality, ambition, determination, and the role of women as mothers and wives in the rapidly changing terrain of the story. In the end, as with many films such as the beautiful Icelandic film "Stronger than Water (Blóðbönd), children can be victims. What is the best of the best for children? Who is our salvation and our future? which has taken place in Pan's labyrinth movies to men's children these days, cinemas realize in complex moral stories that life is confusing, brutal, unfair and as adults we have to act together so that we can lose our basic instincts. the self and the world in the process, the extraordinary and complex and colorful characters in Beauty in Trouble talk about the qualities of what a person does, what drives them into a woman that embodies hope, what a class is - is it the economic status of a person's structure? richly human, as embodied in the last two shots that have moved me incredibly and unexpectedly, so subtle and intelligent that tot it seems unfair about comparisons with American film, and Americans sometimes lack the desire to consider paradoxes in human nature do not offer set resolutions. Interesting moral questions are here, dangerously conceived in an apparent fairy tale for adults. Don't be fooled by a simple story; this is a great movie.
