This is Christopher Guest's only film, which gives Spinal Tap and Princess Bride rival fun value, but never gets to be recognized. The storyline surrounds competitors - dogs - and their owners, who embark on the world of competition dog ... OK, it's about the show. Owners are really characters, because one would have to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but it makes it funny enough. You would never be able to convince me that the fake-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny than catching a merry scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV ... but that is really all that is needed to transfer some doubters. Spinal Tap was a non-stop joke, a joke joke, while Best in Show had several other lulls (and I mean 3 minutes on BRIDGE where something terrible funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger. Casting in this movie is great, and even films that don't usually show movies in general Parker Posey do a great job. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. A pet shop owner through a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag movie. What is amazing about this movie for me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes, so it actually felt like it had a direction . I think there's freedom in such a minimal conspiracy. The role of everyone is quite well done here and the characters are rarely. The realism of how pathetic it seems to an outsider is what makes it more fun than the mighty wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually encounter such savages. If you like Guest stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.
