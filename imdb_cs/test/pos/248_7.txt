This is definitely an excellent musical from 1944 with big young stars and famous veteran actors led by Karel Vidor. Rita Hayworth, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club, along with Phil Silvers (Genius), "Coney Island", who was a comedian in this film and also collaborated and danced with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun", played the role of cover girl magazine promoter and decided that Rusty Parker would be his best model. The music of Jerome Kern is heard over the entire picture and song, "Long Ago and Far Away" is the theme of music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during World War II, which kept peoples peoples out of the war that was going on at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their career exploded on the silver screen for many years. Great music and a movie you don't want to miss is a really cool classic movie. Enjoy
