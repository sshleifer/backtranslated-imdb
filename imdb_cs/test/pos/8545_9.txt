There are many, many older movies that deserve to be converted to DVD format. This is certainly one of them. Anthony Quinn Victory! The score of the films depicts the victims of the Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I do not think any of them would get into the psyche of the victim and the predator, just like this. Anthony Quinn was truly a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the most beautiful creatures without any human visions on the creation of extreme animal life and pull it out so that the viewers who watched without any ideas they witnessed! Really one of our greatest artists. He is missing.
