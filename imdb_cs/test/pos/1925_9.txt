This is the story of the journey of a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed at the Sunday Golden Globe Race, a single-engine yacht race in the world. The story I was very interested in listening to the radio interview of producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of "Touching the Void", one of the first documentary films to achieve commercial success in 2003. a historical event, and I was relieved that it didn't let me go. After 92 minutes I was led through a haunted story and came out with many to think about. Without any refurbishment, this film made great use of the limited audio and video footage it found and turned it into a compelling story that allowed the audience to understand Crowhurst from a personal level. The story appeared as people who had a direct connection with the events, including his wife and his son, and any winner, also the only one who came back from nine racers, Robin Knox-Johnston gave his own reports of what happened . almost 40 years ago. Crowhurst's journals, which he kept at sea for 243 days, are so scary that it was much easier for me to understand what total isolation could be. man. While Crowhurst's body was never found, another competitor, Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank just weeks before claiming the fastest passage prize, committed suicide three years later after failed attempts to properly complete the tour. Everything could be a toll, especially the sea. Director Louise Osmond was also at the Q&A meeting after the performance together with producer John Smithson. I had no idea that she was a female director and that it came as a very nice surprise. The film receives a limited edition in the UK (a few days in some cinemas). Catch it in the cinema while you can, unless you have a state-of-the-art sound system that can restore the sound of invading the Southern Ocean .. then I'm sure they will soon have it on the DVD as well.
