I saw (unfortunately) the dubbed version of Encore. Student Paula Henning (Franka Potente, who was also in the cult favorite "Run Lola Run") plays as a serious medical student who gets to a prestigious school in Germany. Soon, however, he learns that some students are missing and the bodies they work in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I was imprisoned when I saw the dubbed version of Encore. It hurt a lot (words that don't match lips were really quick), but I still liked what I saw. The behavior was good, it was beautifully photographed, it wasn't TOO gruesome and I was never bored. Even more refreshing was the likable heroine who struggles to fall after her. (Mild) nudity was, in a refreshing twist, a man! The previous poster mentions Benn Furmann (who is excellent) who showed his butt but I don't remember seeing it. Regardless, it's a well done, scary and superb thriller. Of all that I read the original German language version, it is best (not one second), but the dubbed version is observable. I give it 7.
