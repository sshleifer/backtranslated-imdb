She currently plays at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for her rundown on the cast in this cast. In Australia, these films were subtitled in English and while French films often received mainstream releases, German films still collect this kind of commercial audience. But like BMW and Mercedes, when the Germans get it right, I like their movies. Like the PQ, time went so fast, a lot of laughter from the audience as any of the nine men and 9 women moved on the 5-minute speed line. <br /> <br /> While many movies are too long one to watch much more. It had a kind of characters and character development for the series. Given that time, I will again read AriesGemini100's review and the link to the actors I liked and their next work in order to keep an eye out of them. I agree .... most of these actors will go for bigger and better things. Some very good actors in this fine film. I saw it in a program listed as mockumentary. Mock or otherwise it was very real. And it's quite romantic. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
