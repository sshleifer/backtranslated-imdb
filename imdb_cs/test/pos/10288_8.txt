All credit for writer / director Gilles Mimouni, who has created this winding, twisted story of fraud and betrayal. While holding the highest control, it keeps the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to be fully aware of what's going on. Even his clever denouement guesses you. The three main performances are also top class, Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci do their best to join the secret. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey adds strength to his supportive role. To give details of the area or character specifics would not be fair. Thierry Arbogast uses the camera to effectively sweep us through this mystery, and editing Cardine Biggerstaff keeps the story a step ahead. The theme of Peter Chase is noble in marriage with the ideal of the script. Many can say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues about love. For me, it's just a scary, elusive puzzle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalization. Hollywood would ruin it with a happy ending. Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody has a thriller like the French. If they do it properly, they can really do it. Vincent Cassell is fascinating because the misleading Max, Romane Bohringer obsessed with the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is the mysterious Lisa. Gilles Mimouni's story is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and deadly wires. <br /> <br /> All credit must go to its manipulation of clever conspiracy and performance from three leaders. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
