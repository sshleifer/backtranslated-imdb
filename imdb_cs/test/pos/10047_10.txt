I saw this movie over Christmas and what a great movie it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I have heard that the film is not very historically accurate (Hollywood is never), I still enjoyed it, just as I have seen few real events. Since then he has become my favorite actor! His playing with Olivia De Havilland was great and the end was fantastic! He brought me to tears when, along with Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), they went to their death on a small big horn. and I grew up watching my movies as a child. But it wasn't until I watched this movie that I realized how great he was in fact. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 10 out of 10 !!
