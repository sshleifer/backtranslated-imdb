I was watching phantabulosa! because over the past few years, Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you haven't seen him in anything before you were ashamed of him for the second time, put your hands on a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production did not disappoint - Michael Sheen almost magically transformed into Kenneth Williams and replaced the performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful. If we don't take anything from the other shows, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole it. I don't know how he does it, but every performance I saw Michael seems to be transformed until the character he plays is really, completely believable, and no matter how hard I try, I can't cause him. I have to go my tea, enjoy!
