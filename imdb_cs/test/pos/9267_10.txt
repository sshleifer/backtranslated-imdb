Closer She Gets ... is a sophisticated documentary dealing with the death of the person I knew. It allows you to look into the private moments of a family involved in the most experienced time of their lives. Parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the topic of the document has reached above and beyond. She was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. This is the most touching work of art, weaving the serious, peaceful and lighter side of life for this family. The story is one that can make you laugh, but also scream when it solves the problems we all face. I highly recommend this document to those who are not afraid to cry and are willing to address the issue of mortality in a human way. This movie will touch you.
