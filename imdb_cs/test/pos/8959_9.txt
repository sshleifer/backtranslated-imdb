Once again, I was amazed that Thomas Gibson did not come to the top of the deck earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson again demonstrates his ability to understand character regardless of sexuality, social status, or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing homosexual from the late 20th century. A tendency that is not effeminate, afraid of the basic principles of love, Gibson's character touches on different emotions. Also worthy of praise is the performance of Cameron Bancroft. His need to be a heterosexual conqueror, unlike the "homosexual conquest" of his best friend, provides a dynamic relationship that is unexpected in many ways. Bancroft and Gibson's chemistry are evident from the first scene they discover. There are many "panels" in this blanket. From homosexual relationships to equal relationships; from heterosexual relationships to exploration of lesbian love; this film travels across a broad spectrum of sexuality and at the same time has the core story of a serial killer. My only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before I discovered this movie! I look forward to seeing it again and highly recommend to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or director Denys Arcand.
