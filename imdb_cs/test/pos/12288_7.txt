This is not the movie's smart, witty and often heart touches movie. It is a retrospective of the unsuccessful relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his estranged Irish friend Grace McKenna. Michael was lucky enough to make a documentary in which he plays his entire relationship and what went wrong. He uses his friendship with the actor he met at Nadia Dajani and who plays Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michaels' relationship is shown from each point whether it is high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell removes the fantastic performance you want to help him find Grace. If so, most of the characters, with the exception of the puzzler, get rid of great performances. Puzzler needs to move the fence along, but it seems too surreal to exist in the cafe. His monologues are often exaggerated and absurd. This is proven by saying, "From this chaos we all try to create order. And out of order, meaning. But in reality there is no such thing as meaning. . "<br /> <br /> Comment saves this movie. Comment is done in vain This is a spinal tap and has Michael and his brother explain the problems they had in making the movie. Very good belly laughter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give this movie 7/10.
