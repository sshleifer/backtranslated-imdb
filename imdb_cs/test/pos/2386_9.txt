I've seen some Fred Carpenter movies about Showtime, Pay Per View, and video / DVD, and I enjoyed most of these movies with a few beers, (Carpenter knows how to have fun) "EDDIE MONROE" and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" are my favorites. I recently saw the promo DVD "EDDIE MONROE" and everything from casting to story and directing all worked smoothly. (Doug Brown's music score was sensational.) I liked to see Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he's an amazing and underrated actor. Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, looked at his acting credits on IMDb and found it was his first major role. Where's the guy! Give Fred Carpenter the credit for discovering Big New Talent, it's just a matter of time before you see this guy who meets Pacino and DeNir. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to have fun and when your limited budget work is amazing, what Carpenter can produce (I read VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter never made a film for more than $ 400,000.00 dollars.) Before I watched "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" took me to a surprised end because of a very good screenplay, good performances from the entire cast (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting for success and major actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great cinematography, direction and music score Doug Brown. As I said, recently I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" if I had to write a comment about these two movies, I would say some of the same things I said about "EDDIE MONROE", all I have two very good the movies don't have to do with "Eddie Monroe", not even a few hundred thousand. Great movie and I don't even drink beer.
