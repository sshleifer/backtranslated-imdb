This is one of the best horror / tense movies that Hollywood has made in years or even decades. Although in my opinion this movie was predictable in some parts, it has everything a good movie should have in this genre to have CHILL, THRILLS, AND YES a lot of GORE! HOUSE OF GOOD SUPPLY WAX !!! In some parts, it was a little bit drawn, that playing wasn't so great, but my rating for HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ...... I have to admit it was the right movie that saw the whole city made of wax. ..... I enjoy these museums myself, but after watching this movie I will look at them a whole new way now!
