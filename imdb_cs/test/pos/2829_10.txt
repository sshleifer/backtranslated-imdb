And it says a lot. Rent it out if you want to be scattered by strangeness, blown away by one of the most bizarre scenarios, directing and casting in the history of movies. I'm upset. I can't believe I watched it. I'm a big fan of Bernadette Peters, normally - but it tested my determination. You don't read any other reviews here, it's best if you know nothing about the plot. Just rent it. You will not believe what you see .......
