A few years ago I first saw this remake of the 1960s classic with Mini Coopers and I remember that I like it very much. About two years later it was seen on TV and I just wanted to know if I'd like it like when I saw it in the cinema. The answer is yes. The film is about a team of thieves who do their last job in Venice. The plan is flawless and perfect. They escape and they won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem that they did not consider: Someone in their ranks does not like to divide the prey, but wants to keep it to herself, even if that means having to kill the rest of the crew. . But everyone but one survives and is on revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving teammates create a clever and sinister plan to steal the gold back and get their revenge on the traitor ... about a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has a lot of goodness that lets you forget about it. It's a typical heist / action movie, but it's definitely one of the best in its kind. The event is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eyesight, the story is fine and special effects are stunning. Even playing is very good, something you won't often see in an action movie. I have to admit that I liked what I saw and I deserve this film 7.5 / 10.
