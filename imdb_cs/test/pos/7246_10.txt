I'll give it 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to detect because it wasn't ... but because it leaves one care for the characters. Acting, all cast, is excellent, especially Joan Hickson, and it's an amazing episode because it's the heart. Miss Marple is asked by Jason Rafiel for a dying request to investigate and solve the murder that occurred about seven or eight years ago, and she has to find out who, why and when she goes. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in the Caribbean mystery, so there is a sense of connection. Nemesis is definitely one for amateur psychologists among us, and if you're one of those who is just happy with lots of blood, guts and ripping action sequences, then you won't like it. But if you're like me, the one who loves to know about PEOPLE and find out what makes them tick is Nemesis.
