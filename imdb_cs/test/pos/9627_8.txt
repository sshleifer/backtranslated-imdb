This is really a kung fu classic. This movie seems to have influenced martial arts movies for decades. Spanish guitar background music, competition schools, incredibly high roof jumps, throwing spears, cheating in tournaments, secret training of exotic karate techniques, patience and perseverance topics, and many more have been copied as "Karate Kid" (1984) "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). I feel happy for the first time I saw this movie in 1972, shortly after its release, just before kung fu movies became the mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with my two friends at the San Diego Theater Center, which is visited by sailors, and although the scenes of glowing red hands and tousled eyeballs have some laughter, the audience got into it, just like our little group. It was a very unforgettable movie for me. Decades later, I could still remember a few specific scenes, even though I forgot about the film title. This film is extraordinary for me now, because one of the two friends I saw with him for the first time (Kenneth Lee Hines of Kitty Hawk), has died since then, so this film serves as a memento of the day together before we married judo and karate lessons in the coming years. Relative kung fu movies would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to think of a bigger film audience, I will objectively rate it as 8/10, due to obvious technical shortcomings. I just recommend that new viewers consider these technical flaws to be proof of their vintage nature and authenticity, and then cheerfully continue to enjoy their testosterone-loaded chaos.
