This movie was advertised as a comedy, but was much more serious than the trailers it made to be. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I expected another laugh. Great performances of Robin Williams and Laura Linney. It's worth seeing, but don't expect you to roll on the floor. The film let me think about what it would be like if the character of Robin Williams were a real man who ran for president. Would we choose a comic? I doubt it, unfortunately. Such sharp honesty is something that is missing today. This is a movie I will add to my DVD library as soon as it comes out on DVD. The movie has a heart.
