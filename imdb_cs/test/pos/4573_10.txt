Idiocracies felt like Mike Judge took my thoughts on the company and put them in the movie. In fact, the film is a social commentary. Sometimes she feels like a documentary. Luke Wilson did a good job of playing the boring average Joe (as in most of his movies). Of course, the Idiocracy was the extreme of the current state of society. But that's what makes most comedy fun, extreme of any situation. Fiction is not so different from reality. With children he praises the materialistic culture of hip-hop and prides himself on being ignorant. When people feel useless in life, they behave. They give them a purpose in the world. And the worst people seem to behave. I understand how others don't like it. It doesn't help most jokes was the 2nd degree bathroom humor. Not very different from Kevin Smith's movie. Idiocracy discards logic, reason, intelligence (for good reason). Comeback Mike Judges has been eliminated.
