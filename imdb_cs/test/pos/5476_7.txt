What I saw on Wolfgang Petersen's films was pretty good. He knows how to act, create tension and interest you. Eastwood is big, sometimes excellent. This is true for both his acting and his direction. Both hands in tough work. The concept is not bad and the game cat and mouse works well. Malkovich is doing pretty well and his and Eastwood are playing each other. I suppose it won't do anything new, really ... but it never says or needs it. They are two great actors, each of whom plays a basic role that they have made in other places in their careers, that they manage remarkably well and with a magnificent director at the helm. Indeed, it's fun, well done, and it just brings. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and writing characters is also. The film can be exciting and intense, and if you leave it, you'll probably have fun and get involved, though there are great movies. Stimulation is almost in place. I recommend it to any major actor fan, director and / or this type of film. 7/10
