I found this movie to be very pleasing. I'm impressed that I suppose. I happen to adore Kathy Bates. Ms Bates Plays Grace Beasley The film takes you from her married life in Chicago to England where she is home to her recently murdered Victor Fox singing idol. He meets his three surviving sisters and also finds out that Victor is leaving a male lover, Dirk Simpson. Br /> <br /> The story takes you into some surprisingly comic and gratifying situations where Grace and Dirk build a real favor after their first gross refusal on their part. with Grace's pint-size, cheerful daughter-in-law, Maudie, find a serial killer who murdered Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the picture did a great job. Especially Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. It's weeping. Music is absolutely charming. Other posters that have found problems with some parts of this movie just have no idea. <br /> <br />
