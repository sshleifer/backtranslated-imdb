Obviously, previous reviewers are not fans of this genre here, but I think this is pretty good. It's cruelly cute smart and dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with a child. It also makes me look at some other Nadia movies, many youtube comments about how hot it is. In this video. Of course there is some Burton influence here, but I don't think Brad is trying to pull him out. He just jumps and adds his talents to the genre I can appreciate. I like what she does and does it well, Nuff said!
