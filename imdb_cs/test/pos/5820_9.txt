This love story with light (for Cassavetes) is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by Geny Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands has never been more beautiful as a suppressed, injured woman in the mid-1930s who meets her fight in Seymour. Cassell is a powder of energy and a romantic image (according to his conditions). Val Avery has great backing performance like Zelmo Swift and the unusual (as always) Timothy Carey, who is worth the adoption. Between Spouses and Women Under the influence, this is Cass's most accessible film, which should touch everyone's heart (especially the Cassavetes hate), who claim that his films are sometimes too long and hard. He made my Top Ten that year and not enough people. 8 out of 10.
