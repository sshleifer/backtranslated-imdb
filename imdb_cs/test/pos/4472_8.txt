I love this movie, although I don't like the Egyptians picture, as an Egyptian citizen alone! that's why he earns eight of the 10. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustine and the leopard is unpleasant, and of course, for loneliness and life in this cave for so long that it is developing a kind of madness and passion for this leopard. A very moving scene when a leopard dies, watch Augustine's reaction .. <br /> <br /> All in all it is nice and look forward to reading Balzac.
