First, I never got into Dr. Who. Frankly, I have never been given the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (puns) because they have never been "big" in the US, as elsewhere. Of course I have to say (I must say) Of course, after the second season, it's one of the best science fiction shows I've ever seen. Now I'm watching a lot of sci-fi shows from around the world and the show excels. The first season was in the beginning, with Christopher Ecclestone in the title role and I thought it was amazing. Of course, it was also beautiful Billie Piper, who adds such humanity and warmth to the Rose character that no one could do better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky, who are just those who watch. Then there's David Tenannt. At first I thought it was too gawky-looking to play a character (his ears !!) but after watching the second season, he fits cool. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. It is brilliant with elegant dialogue and can turn serious without detonating the eye. In addition to great casting, acting is from most guest actors that have appeared. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and are damn right. <br /> <br /> The production and direction of the show is excellent. Occasionally, there will be some raw effects, but it has always been a factor in the original series and, like these episodes, is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing in the series: The Stories. Writing people is always the key to great fun. Russell T. Davies wrote many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they did a great job. They managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can break older stories and enemies of older doctors (my friend explains a lot to me when we watch the show) and respectfully. I'm not going to mention anything about Season 2 and how it will end because the Sci-Fi Channel has just begun to broadcast Season 2. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it. It's so much fun and excitement. You will never want to take your eyes off or miss the word of dialogue. It's really so good. PS: Thanks to the producers for Nicholas Briggs back! **EXTERMINATE!**
