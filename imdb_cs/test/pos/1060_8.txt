Personally, I don't like a lot of b / w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a magazine about how Martha Stewart is from Connecticut. Of course he's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr. Yardley, asks her to host NAVY sailor during Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone at Christmas, invites you to a Christmas party. From there it just went crazy. <br /> <br /> As the film takes place on a New England farm, the film has a pleasant holiday feeling. In addition, the characters are cheerful. Mr. Yardley always shouts orders and Liz's friend Felix always shouts 'Catastroph!' when things go wrong. In the end, the film ends as Christmas should end; cheerful fat man laughs and screams "What Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter how old you are, you'll love this movie.
