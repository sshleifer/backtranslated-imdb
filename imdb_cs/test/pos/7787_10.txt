Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan behaved brilliantly, while Aamir's acting was much better than Salman. PERFECTIONIST 'in Bollywood and proves it in every movie. The story is about two young boys Amara (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), both of them are poor families and they are a great dreamer. They want to get rich without suffering from pain. When they hear about Raveena Tandon's daughter, Paraj Rawal, who comes to India to find his groom, both of them deceive their fathers to marry Rachel Bajaj and the journey begins. There is also a twist in the film that makes the film even more fun.Paresh Rawal is in a double role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and acted brilliantly as he always does.Shakti kapoor (criminal master Gogo) also adds a great comedy. This film is a ticklish comedy from the first minute to the end and is one of Bollywood's classic comedy films.
