I agree with Vince, this film paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci threw peanuts on the pianist reminded me of his "How am I funny?" routines in Goodfellas. It is a very underrated film and deserves attention. As with many other mob movies, the topic The Death Collector Rings True: Always Respect Don.
