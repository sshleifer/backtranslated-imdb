Animated shorts just aren't much better than this beautiful Canadian movie. This short feature is dripping with Canadian links, and this movie is likely to be especially appreciated by Canadians. But the basic story is universal, and it is loved by writer Roch Carrier. It's a cheerful story I knew quite a bit ago, and recently I was lucky enough to see him again, so I just wrote a strong recommendation for him. This is a masterpiece and you must see if you are Canadian.
