"A Slight Case of Murder" is an excellent television movie worth the rental price. William H. Macy is great as a film critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although it may sound dark, the movie is actually quite light and funny, with many unforgettable lines ("Acting is harder than I thought - sometimes you see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology" and my personal favorite "For next week answers these two questions about film noir, what do these people do during the day? and why is it always raining?) The film has great support cast including real life wife Macy Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin.
