I'm not exactly sure about the accuracy with this movie, but I can tell you that I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The character of the gust, perfectly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory. he informed this film, but he managed to avoid preaching to the audience. it made me sad, it made me sad, I felt alive and I'm glad to spend time watching the movie. You have no time to understand what is happening and take you on a roller coaster ride of true human emotions. I thought I knew my history, I probably didn't know it at all! I give this move 9 out of 10, and I recommend it to all adults, and young adults, and young in the heart, just not young. but once they can see the r's rated r, make them a priority.
