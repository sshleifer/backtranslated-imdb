OK I haven't read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ???? Who knows ?? But I loved the movie. It was fun, not a bit boring, pleasant and above all heart of heart. The friendship between the two children was so clean and innocent. These children behaved so well, especially the son of the servant. O my God, this is the form of God on the face of the earth. ARGHHHH steals our hearts so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* Another friend of a rich person is a child and his confusion and frustration can be understood. But I was angry when he left and ignored his friend when he needed to comfort himself. Anyway, he was just a child and a little stubborn. I wish the film also showed an older version of a poor boy. Arghh is just worried about the end. This movie is sad. I felt terribly sad. Tears fell into my eyes. Yes, background scores are fantastic, scenes are WOW. Kite scenes are fascinating. And that's a little adventure in the middle. He behaved wonderfully and cast greatly. The children behaved so well. Great direction. I do not know why this film failed WOOO the Critics. But definitely WOO me. 10/10 Must-see ??????
