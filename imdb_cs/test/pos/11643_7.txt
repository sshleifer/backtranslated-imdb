This film has two new features in relation to the report sent by other equally good films on the death penalty and executions. It is also an emphasis on the drama that will endure the victims' parents - without hiding the hatred and the desire for revenge that they feel or alleviate the horror that execution represents - and the Christian vision of all implied questions. We also have to point out that in this film, a convicted person is not the usual kind of innocent person we see in other films about executions that do not lead us to give up the idea that criminal execution is just like legal murder. Last but not least, we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight that is devoted to the last moments of the execution run with all the catharsis that show the condemned last words and the detail with which the act of execution itself is perceived in a parallel cut with the murderous scenes in the forest emphasizing that we are confronted with another murder, as helpless as the other, but carried out in a cool and supposed "legal" way.
