I use a lot of IMDB. Especially reading other people's comments about movies I haven't seen or seen. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way I look like a movie. Since autumn 94, I've seen it at least a dozen times when I first saw it in the theater. I feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think it's his best. It was his last. I was very sad the day I knew he had died because we were sure we'd lost a little more of it. RED is the best Kieslowski + incredible performance of Trintignant & Jacob + Sobocinski's cinematography. If you haven't seen it, SEARCH IT !!! If you have, just go back to it !! Red: Just a masterpiece. please forgive my poor english!, readers
