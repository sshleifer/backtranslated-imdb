I almost didn't see 'Hi-De-Hi!'. I think it must have been a title that dissuaded me. These days, the Welsh language versions of "The Radio Times" were used only to print the titles of certain shows without providing information about what they were about. 'Hi-De-Hi!' he suggested a bad quiz show organized by Leslie Crowther or worse imports to the US. But I managed to catch a later episode, and I was surprised when I wrote it to Jimmy Perry and David Croft. As in the case of "Army Dad" and "It's not half the hot mom" Perry based them on personal experience, in this case at his recreational camp. Before cheap air transport arrived in the 1960s, these camps surfaced along the British coast, providing entertainment to the working class families and making millions for their owners. one such camp in the 80s as chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to everyone and diverse as 'Shag Land' for not going to!) <br /> <br /> Later 50 years old, it began with college academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) taking over as a Maplin's entertainment manager, a job he was badly equipped to handle. His staff included resident comedian Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his sidekick Spike (Jeffrey Holland), the miserable Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), snobby dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland) and an unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) who longed for Fairbrother on every occasion. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as a cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be 'Yellowcoat' (all the important members of the staff wore them). A number of sexy girls took these coats too, most notably Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and the statue of Rikki Howard's 'Betty'. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He told his staff in the form of illiterate missiles that poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" was a greeting for the campers, usually met with an equally resilient 'Ho-De-Ho! One fan was late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the characters in real life. as well as the most tragic as Archie Rice was, the comedian whose great break never came was limited to cracking coral gags for the amusement of drunken listeners late at night. He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few benefits, and in one memorable episode of Fairbrother Patience broke out and he sounded him out: "Lie, Ted!" All lies! ‚Äù. As with any other Perry / Croft series, the cast was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's prissy 'Gladys' got on her nerves (no wonder Anne Robinson hates Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic' Mr.Partridge 'and Felix Bowness' jockey' Fred Qulley 'more than compensated. The visual gag everyone remembers is a drunk Mr.Partridge who noticed a pantomime horse on a real beach. When he looked at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decided to hold it and instead drop the banana he ate! With its frothy blend of nostalgia and 50s succulent gags, Hi-De'Hi was a big hit for BBC-1 in the 1980s, leading to a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins. When Cadell returned to the theater, he went down. I've never gotten to his replacement, the Squadron Leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor brought him to replace him as "Uncle Sammy." This period sometimes caused problems; In one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to save Peggy, who was dressed like a shark for some reason. The revealing costumes they wore were bad at the time. They still looked great in them, so who's complaining? In another, Ted sang Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' to campers. It wasn't composed (Les Reed and Barry Mason, by the way) until 1968. Maplins closed his door in 1988, and the last shot was that of Peggy (now Yellowcoat) all alone in the camp \ t into the air and shouting (what else?) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. I don't rate it as high as other Perry and Croft shows, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate immense public affection, mainly because it featured sympathetic characters in a recognizable setting. Good Night Campers!
