I really didn't like "As Good as Gets", but I'm a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was Albert Brooks' excellent work. Here, in Spain, he is little known, and only as the 2nd Division version of Woody Allen on the West Coast. He played a big part, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played a role that reminds me a bit of her role in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). Finally, the rest of the cast is also great. Robert Prosky, one of these well-known faces of American cinematography, the ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, quite well placed on this role, I think always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and especially the short statement by Jack Nicholson. Maybe he has no good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway ... James L.Brook's best film, a great story (greatly solved) and an excellent cast of one of the best 80's movies
