The story of this film is as stupid as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who might be upset by the ridiculous story. She's a wicked woman. It's a character so far from his NYPD and LA Law roles as you could get. <br /> <br /> If you thought he had the look and the chops to play a really bad role for a boy, it's your presence. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and small black minidresses throughout the film. She has always had some of the biggest legs in the history of movies. This makes the film well worth it for this foot admirer. <br /> <br /> For this reason, I would only buy a DVD if it was available.
