First, I caught up with Jennifer as I emerged from the city when he appeared on TV in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before it was over, but it stayed with me until I followed him. His attraction is that while there is not much, he intertwines an interesting atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (at that time a real man-wife) show seductive chemistry with a low key. Lupino plays a woman who has been dealing with a house-sitting in a huge California homestead, whose former caretaker, Jennifer, has gone up and gone. (Jack Nicholson's Shining Shades, though in this case, it's not Lupino, who's going or gone, mad). Duff is a man in a city that manages the estate's estate. It becomes more and more involved, unspoken, obsessed with what happened to her predecessor in an old dark house full of descending staircases and locked cellars. The atmosphere and romantic byplay are by far the best part of the movie because viewers are likely to find a little bit disappointed - it's just not that much (except for a little friss at the tail end, which Brian assumes) De Palma is a movie codas. But it's well done, and again, it's sticking with you. Extra Attraction: This is a movie that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which would be part of Ol 'Blue Eyes' standard repertoire.
