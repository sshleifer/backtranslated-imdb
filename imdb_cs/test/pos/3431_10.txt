This thing works at all levels - it's intense like a thriller, full of gay men Lars von Trier, but also a very own movie - and it's a message: happiness comes from the inside, best personified in a wounded soldier who practically (and believe it or not) humorously) he breaks his limb through the entire film, all the while he apologizes to others for putting on them. You laugh at him, but you also envy him. The central character is a well-meaning but clunky writer who spends the entire film trying to help those who make friends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin just after World War II. It combines parallel stories together and really recovers in this process. To say things go wrong is underestimated - and structurally the characters are in complete contradiction. It's like each of them has the opposite - just as tight as looking at an anti-matter collision. You will not believe the sick who will finally laugh. To say more would qualify as a spoiler - all I can say is that it's a shame this movie wasn't released in the US nor on DVD. Some Moron probably told them that the Americans would not get it - which is stupid because we not only "get" but produce things like South Park ... If this movie goes to the US market, it should be sold as mainstream black. comedy because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
