I have to say it's my favorite movie of all time. I've seen it more than 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overcrowding) It's what was the 1980s like and what a romantic story with a few morals inside. I recommend to anyone who wants to relive college. Buy a copy now it's classic !!!!
