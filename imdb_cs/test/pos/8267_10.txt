When she broadcast Precious Bane in America, I was amazed at this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Really, Clive Owen understood the character he was playing. I went to the bookstore and ordered an original novel, which is even more beautiful, and which came out of print after the book was printed - even though I saw it several times online. I was also hoping for Oscar, which was won by Janet McTeer, and the huge popularity of Clive Owen, which the BBC naturally gets on DVD ... It must be the only production that the BBC has ever created and is NOT for sale. Come to the BBC - you have the money to make us fans. Get it on DVD, please!
