If your looking for a movie with fantastic music, a nice cast and a story that's not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes I like in this movie; some make you laugh, others contemplate you. Editing I think is amazing, really fast and often funny. Shure, maybe there was some potential in the whole thing, the whole story somehow on the surface; maybe a little too many characters are involved. But I don't care because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the music scene! One of my favorite: hot-lunch-jam sequence. This piece is so raw, funky and specially shot ("music-hell-break-loose" handcamera). I miss this raw energy in today's music videos; the only similar energy I found in Bette Midlers "roses", all the concert shots. Take to take. So, FAME is a wonderful nostalgia-trip when synthesizers where heavy and walk-mans are not available. certainly not for everyone.
