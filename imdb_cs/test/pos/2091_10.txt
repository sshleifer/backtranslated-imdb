When a bomber, patricid, pornographer, and crazy biker, along with various other forms of social filth, have enough of their infested cells, they see a rat looking for a hole. A group of 9 souls escaped from the sewers and used their newly found freedom and heads for civilization. What follows soon is not surprising. Their wake is followed by complete chaos and horror. Everyone seems to have some unfinished business to take care of them. <br /> <br /> Free based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far the best 5 best films I've seen this year. Running around 2 am 9 SOULS adds a story so strong that it literally leaves you breathless. Beautiful, yet subtle, the use of scrolling lands adds the realism expected from this story. Toshiaki Toyoda's vision (Blue Spring, Porno Star) is absolutely enchanting when he realizes the sadness of the characters. As fast as any character understands their dream, it is as fast as it is torn from them. All responsibility for the success of this film should not only be on the director's shoulders, but the props must also go to the actors. This movie was full of great games from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (son of Miyuki Matsudy from audition) brings stellar performance and seems to bring some of her mothers to the screen. I have to put the props on Artsmagic DVD. This is the 6th movie I've seen and every DVD seems to be better and better. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and sharp. It's very annoying to try to watch a movie that's too dark in the transmission, so the discs of these cats are nice. The bottom line is this movie will soon get a masterpiece state of viewers around the world. In 2005, pay attention to 9 SOULS; It's a really amazing movie to watch.
