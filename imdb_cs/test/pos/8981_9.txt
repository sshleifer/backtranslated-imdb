This doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference - a big difference. The Best George Crile Reseller 2003, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and enchanting account of the most likely "difference maker" imaginable. The relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, "Good Time Charlie" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his liberal legislation. Charlie Wilson, sympathetic and disgusting (also for politician), served his constituency well, because the good people of Lufkin really wanted only two things, their weapons and were left alone. It's Easy Street, filled with his beliefs of band beauties that are well known, like Charlie's Angels. When asked why his entire office staff is made up of attractive young assistants, his answer is classic. teach them to write, but you can't teach 'em to grow breasts.' There is no argument. But even the poorest rapscallion has a conscience somewhere, and for Charlie Wilson, the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan have moved him to gather his entire political ingenuity to fund a complete, humiliating defeat of the Russian army and possibly even help to speed up the end of the Cold War. Fat chance, huh? Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and the clever, elegant script of Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the-scenes machinations of three colorful characters involving "Charlie's team". The "team" on the screen consists of three amazing actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations among them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly underrated fashion that is among his best work in years. He is promoted, frequented and abounded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite starring still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else do they have a bikini scene to know the world? Mrs. Roberts looks good and own, but the script never gives us a hint as to why Kabul and the country are so important to her character. Maybe both Afghan dogs usually know her side - but we as an audience will never do that. As for the third member of the "team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he discovers, like Gust Aurakotos, an intelligent, street (ie Graduate without Ivy League) CIA who knows the score - both in the agency's meeting room. and in Wilson's bedroom. In order for Mujahideen to succeed, the most important help the US can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter, which rules heaven. It takes money, a lot of money, and finally "Charlie's team" secretly forces those in Congress to finance $ 1 billion in effort for advanced armed Afghan rebels. This includes cutting-edge, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, ugly stuff. That this kind of multi-billion illegal activity can and is behind Congress is really alarming. Every American should see this film or read this book because it reveals a really frightening aspect of the political scene that is customary in business, which is rarely visible outside the walls of our own government. Oh momma, I wish it wasn't so ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result for "Team Charlie" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unexpected end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now being used against our Taliban and others. Since the funding was "completely hidden", the young generation in this part of the world has no idea that the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism was a direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russians have gone, so is our help - zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip for keeping meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall result is a wild disaster - it is like the predecessor of the "mission accomplished". As Nichol's film so strongly warns, "the ball you have set in motion can keep bouncing even after you have lost interest in it." "Mike Krzyzewski knows, Eva Longoria Parker knows, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows it, but he's not a typical American politician. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were good guys. Talk about Catch-22 (next movie Mike Nichols). Maybe Charlie Wilson said it best, "We're f and% till the end of the game." <br /> <br /> Again.
