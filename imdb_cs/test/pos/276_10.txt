I was half tense when I watched a selection of short films late at night - but I sat upright from the first shots of "I Shout Love" and I couldn't take my eyes off for its full, short, perfect length. With incredibly stimulated performance and performance, this film retains its humorous / sad / sharp tone. Credits at the end went so fast and in such a small type I had to go online to find the person responsible for this masterpiece. What a pleasant surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, the main actress who is rarely seen. Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) are turning into a rich, moving performance as a couple of horrors. As they work through the reprise of Tessa's favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal the dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talent - and to the capabilities of the director / writer. The film creates a moving story with laughter-loud-moments and-caught grief. "I Shout Love" is undoubtedly one of the biggest and most memorable short films I've ever expected. He has a joke, heart and stunning originality. It depends.
