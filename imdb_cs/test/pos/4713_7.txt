A powerful film that, in the second half of 2007, gained a lot of meaning after its new desperate movement of Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complicated mix of people's feelings out there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, along with a bit of anger, because I feel that no one, not the world, nor anything, is doing anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings were made straight from the movie and they were intended when they were made, so it's a successful movie. The desire for peace, the search for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to submission. In fact, it is a Buddhist Burmese culture that has left the door wide open to its dictators. But how can you feel angry at these poor people?
