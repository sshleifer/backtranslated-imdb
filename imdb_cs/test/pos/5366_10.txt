A beautifully thought-out and encompassing film that leaves an imprint outside his initial life. It is based on a true story, one of the many "small" World War II stories that allow most cultures of ordinary people to be influenced by others perceived as former enemies and possibly future enemies, with darkened war clouds on the horizon. Looking at Stony Brook Film, the film was enthusiastically received. Well written and professionally cast. The characters were most believable and attracted them to experience their trials and tribulations.
