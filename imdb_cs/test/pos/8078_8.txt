Being a Bills fan, I initially found it uncomfortable to have a movie about Bills and the loss of four superbowls. But as soon as I started watching, I felt really connected. It was really nice to see "Bills" win a superbowl, and I must say that for a TV movie it was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as QB and Jon Voight as an old school coach did a very good job. 8 out of 10
