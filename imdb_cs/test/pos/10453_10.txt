Spoilers in this review! Despite several highly unlikely scenes, including PE boys measuring penises in the competition and several compulsory teenagers trying to get on the road, this film captures the painful nature of high school in a way that has few teenage movies. Done. He does this not only by showing three friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, smoking, drinking, sometimes on teenagers, but also about the nature of friendship itself, because these three friends have loyalty tested. This film is the moment when childhood ends. For the timid romantic Gary, when she first sees the beautiful Karen, she falls in love immediately. The awakening of emotions in Gary is great on screen, and he proves her with love by taking her when her lover loves her. This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence, because the ties with his two best friends will be tested and broken throughout the story. A confident female man, Rick, is a high school person we all secretly wish to be: handsome, cool and always has incredibly beautiful girls in a snap. Rick turns out to be a cadre, but you must remember that his character is only 17 years old. Panic and make a bad decision. From Rick's perspective, the story is also about finding one girl of his dreams, a bad break, and then at the end of reconciliation. Looking at Rick's face as Gary walks and sees Karen kissing Rick, shows that he finally understands his best friend and he loves the same woman. As in real life, you must not, because your friend has unrequited love. This is the film's tragedy. Rick is not a villain and constantly reminds Gary and Dave through his film that they are his best friends. But the compassionate quality of Gary's performance is at the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place and he is consumed by the love of Karen. But in the end Karen does not want Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who are engaged without giving up who exist in the vacuum of their own ego and never cease to realize the emotional damage and trauma they cause to others. This film is brutal in its declaration of love and friendship, but that's what makes it unique among teen movies. He ceases to be a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, even though he is condemned to a tragic conclusion. Anyone who has ever found a girl of her dreams and won it will understand. High school hearing crunches are as real as the emotional tension of adulthood, and this film will remind you of a bold move. Gary's last twist as he leaves with the inscribed medallion is as charming as any movie in the cinema. After watching that it's really from two movies, one feels. The first part is a stupid teen sexploitation movie, and once the story begins, it's a heavily influencing drama. Great movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was destined for his selection of many rising stars, including The Police, The Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
