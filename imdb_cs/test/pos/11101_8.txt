Director John Schelesinger's career was extraordinary. We watched this movie when it first came out, but I wanted to see it again when it recently appeared on the cable. The film has a faded look as we see it today, but it is still interesting because of the intense performance of two principals. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, don't read it and more. Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends who came from the upper middle class. Chris went to the seminary to become a priest, but he gave up. Daulton became a small drug user and merchant. These two lives seem to run parallel when a couple engages in illegal activity that demonstrates their nearsightedness. In fact, it shows how the two young men miscalculated in their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two were in a way so naive that they could pull something bigger and better equipped people could not imagine that it could be done. in discovering the subconscious role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other peoples, in this case Australia, about something he finds based on absolute coincidence. When it comes to Daulton, we know that the whole thing is doomed because no one in the drugs will ever mean anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no idea about the extent of what they were trying to do, nor about its consequences. Timothy Hutton was in this period of his career, an actor who went to places. He proved he has talent with his work in other films, so it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to choose him, a choice that pays off well. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed intensity as before. In fact, Mr. Penn sometimes reminded us of a young Robert Mitchum. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. One cannot think who could play this duo, but it is. "Falcon and the Snowman", even though they're not on the same level as the other great John Schlesinger movies, are an interesting look at ours. too far past.
