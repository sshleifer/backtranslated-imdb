I hate vampire movies. it was said that this was very interesting to me. I want to point out one thing tho. "Bakjwi" literally means a bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see Count Dracula or vampires who become bats and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many categorize them as "exceptional." As I watched the movie, I realized that the theme of the bat is deeply rooted in this film than just to make the bat join the vampire. The Duality of Human Nature = If you have ever read aesop's fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds fight and the bat simply cannot seem aside and try to play both sides to their advantage. Mammals and birds find out what this bat was doing, and at the end of the story they throw bats out of their lands. two opposing sides of human nature are constantly in battle throughout the film ex. Sang-hyun blind priest friend, Sang-hyun struggle to quench his thirst and his sexual desire, tae-ju play both sides, her ordinary boring life vs her excitement looking vampire adventure, etc. (will not destroy too much, u have to watch the movie) this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious pages of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, vengeance you name! I feel like many people find this film boring and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I haven't seen b4 yet. I wouldn't say it's the best work of CW Park, but it's mos. def. weirdest to understand, but darkly interesting!
