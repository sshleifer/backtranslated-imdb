If you overlook the technical problems of this early (1930) sound film, such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of John Wayne, this film will find an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie ever made. Beginning at Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga cars, people and animals to the west. The cars are pulled out of the huge cliffs and cross the flooded river with a considerable risk to riders in the cars. The Indians meet Wayne and allow the train to cross their country. Later, the Indians meet west of the train to fight them. Cars form a huge circle with horses and cattle in a circle, and shoot their rifles to create a veil of smoke with the circling Indians. When the battle is over, the dead are buried in place, and people and cars leave. This scene is remarkable because the camera stays with the dead as a living departure. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from life. The cars meet with a big storm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. Finally, they arrive at a destination near a redwood or redwood in Oregon. The film is made in a 70 mm widescreen format at a ratio of about 2.0: 1 (in 1930!). I did not mention the conspiracy because it is secondary to the picturesque and enormous amount of work involved in making this film. Moviemakers will never work so hard again to such a movie or some movie. Due to the technical limitations of the sounds, the music sometimes moves, as Wayne leaves her girlfriend to hunt down her friend's killers and end. While all the critics of The Searchers and Wayne's psychology, racism, short mood and complex characters, The Big Trail give us the story of simple people who encounter extreme difficulties. One of the best westerns I've seen.
