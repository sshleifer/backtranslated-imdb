In this extremely eccentric film, the question arises: Who are the crazy people? The answer becomes less clear as the film goes on. Renee Zellweger loses her awareness of whiney her voice, and while her voice is still tall, she is incredibly effective as Betty's shocked shell. In fact, it is so effective that I almost wanted her to be a little crazy because her created reality was so believable. This is the first time that Mrs Zellweger has been invited to carry a film and she is more than a task. Chris Rock ?? though as ordinary? is quite limited as Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and sometimes only surfaces and whenever he needs it most. There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale of "The Wizard of Oz"? then later in the movie she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never been from Kansas before. At one point Doris Day's best-known song is Que Que Sera Sera's on the soundtrack, and later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes it as something going on with Doris Day. ' <br /> <br /> This is an extremely unpredictable movie with everyone's performance, including a supportive cast. It's a surprising ending, which, in fact, is actually quite predictable. <br /> <br /> If for no other reason you see this movie just to listen to the human voice master: Morgan Freeman.
