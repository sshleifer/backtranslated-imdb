One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching a movie is to get lost in the movie. If you want it to wash you completely, to absorb it as it is, so fill it up fully. Every time I see it, 'Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years, it has been an image that critics loved to hate. Many of them threw darts at his vulnerability. But perhaps it is precisely because the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is suddenly forbidden, distant, possibly dangerous; Beware of what lies inside! Spooky chords of music, seen through the 20th-Fox logo, bring us into the names of other secular turquoise inscriptions. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we were descending into some vault of antiquity where great treasures could be mixed with precarious dangers. (One might imagine that Darryl Zanuck commands: 'Do it Ancient!') Then, as the dark dramatic story unfolds, all in the same tone that was set at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood Egyptian Trilogy from the '50s' 'The Ten Commandments' portrayed the severity of civilization, the phenomenal "land of the pharaohs" and their "nuts and bolts," while the "Egyptian" all shows it, from magic to tragedy to be interested. There is no need to say much about players, but I think that over time, Bella Darvi is being redeemed: what a perfect face for the role, directly from symbolic painting, if her actions would not please some, it could be argued that in her apparently, the role of "courtesan" is better in bed than yakking to some poor helpless admirer. I think Curtiz has captured the wickedness of her sad-masochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with crazy, censorship Sir Peter Ustinov was quite kind in his memories of "Egyptian" and wrote that it was "like being lost in a huge set for" Aida. " His pronunciation of the word 'beer' I have ever learned (one of the historically accurate references of the film: the invented beer of Egypt!) Henry Daniell, egads, is a perfect performance. Gene Tierney, what's the treasure on the screen. Bless the DFZ for giving it this "late" role. C'mon people, don't be so hard on Victor Older! He's the son of a cheese maker! Who rose from Pharaoh! Sounds like a special American opportunity. One of the best moments: existential observations of John Carradin on the sand of time. And Purdom's statement about dwelling in the West. If this is not an epic "grade", what is it? Of course, along with everything else, the music is noble. It is often noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the screen's most compelling scores, perfectly harmonious, yet each theme is well developed, with the life of its own. Newman, who had printed the DFZ for a while, called Herrmann, someone to whom he could trust implicitly to take half the burden. Benny, who is not the easiest person to work with. inspiring music. They changed allusions, ingenious approach. No spoilers that did what they did here, but Benny brings the edge, mysterious, amazing sounds. Alfred brings fulsomeness, desire, poignancy. They are both completely epic. Even when you are seen in a pressed TV press, you can see the names of both composers side by side in the main credits that an ultra-comfortable anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate appear to be the backbone of armor. Leon Shamroy, Dean of CinemaScope, won't let us. Brightened green and moody shadows (presumably distortion in all the horrific TV prints I have seen over the years) perfectly accompany the multidimensional scenario (from Big Philip Dunn and WB Veterinarian Casey Robinson, whom Curtiz had to take with him) by the 20th). What is remarkable is that Shamroy, who, like Fox's cinematography institution like Newman, was with music, would have a "Cleopatra" lens a few years later, but in the brighter and sharper images of Todd A-O in the 1960s. These old studio boys are really my heroes. <br /> <br /> For me, who wants all the imperfections and critical opportunities in the picture like this? I'd rather go back to her spell and jump into his sea of ​​kindness to appear after the inspiring culmination of "The End" that is refreshed, moved and hungry for more. And yes, we should cry on the 20th-Fox for the release of a DVD worthy of DFZ Heritage.
