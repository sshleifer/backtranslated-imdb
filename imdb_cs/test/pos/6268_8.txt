God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (film-wise;)), science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> This one, of course, was a little harder to watch, but another fun BAD movie . <br /> <br /> I like how people anticipate a negative review with "I usually enjoy bad movies, but ..." No, but it was a bad movie for people who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. Miles O'Keefe was Conan of a poor man, but oh, what fun. Who can't talk to a primitive nuclear bomb, hangglider, and a shabby rubber monster? It's okay to hate this movie if you just like a Hollywood dick like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really mean I can't love bad movies, look at this. <br /> <br /> those movies that are fun to rent for a beer, or if you have a couple of friends around you and are looking for a little carefree fun. <br /> <br /> My Rating 8/10.
