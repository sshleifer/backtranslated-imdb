it looks like a bet I've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich in perception sensitive. Antonioni is relatively wise to his film. Malkovich is so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. After this movie I changed my world view. I am a beginner writer in Russia - Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy - and I'm pretty sure Antonioni is good and entertaining for Russian because I and we understand his opinion. so I don't understand his smaller attack on IMDb. Sure, if we talk from Russia and our people, we love Antonioni because of his romantic soul and the positive perception of the surrounding reality
