This movie kicks ass, bar none. Bam and his crue have made this film themselves. Since I got the DVD (4 days ago) I've been watching it three times and every time I look at it it's better. I can't wait to see Grind go out in theaters. If his something like Haggard is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTcellphone
