This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I have been on the water since I was 13 years old, so I had a lot of humor, as well as getting to know a lot of scenery near the country (the film, although held in and around Virginia, was filmed around San Francisco Bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east from the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the San Francisco Pier at the very end of the film (including the ship I worked on). As other people have said, the actors seemed to enjoy doing this movie and making it fun. The line "We're getting down, sir! I can hear a few lobsters washing out," is invaluable to me at least. I'm one of the many people who anxiously await the introduction of the letterboxed DVD of Down Periscope.
