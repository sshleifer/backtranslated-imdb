A very typical Almod√≥var of that time and in a way no less humorous than many of his later works. And why is it? There is nothing that can be provoked or shocked, and I think such an effect is more random than intentional. No, great humor comes from the underlying, almost unreal, absurdity that is woven in the landscape: Almost complete lack of character taboo. It is the same kind of "comic tension" you will find in his later works, even if you find it in a rougher version. He builds for masterpieces to come, but he is not yet there. The only reviewer who commented on this movie before I did, claimed that it had to be a "very selected" group of people who 'd find this movie happy. I do.
