Linda Blair has been working for forty years, and although she never escapes parts of Regan MacNeil in "The Exorcist", several of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary state to have as much effect as "witchcraft." She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned hotel hotel that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by several real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and meet the photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer friend (Leslie Cumming), who illegally squat at the hotel while investigating the legend. local witch (Hildegard Knef). In ancient times, witch hunting seems to have resulted in her suicide and she was with her baby at the time. Jane, unaware of the danger, recently dreamed of the dramatic death of the witch and Jane's brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) was directly attended by her haunted ghost of black garment, which she calls "lady in black." The group time at the island inn starts at rest; But the Lady in Black is already unknown, but has already sent a captain of her hired ship (George Stevens). Before long, isolation and winter will affect everyone, and this is the period of mood and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of horror. She plans to avenge her fate by having Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims meets the aspect of her vengeful curse - greed, lust, and virgin blood. When the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, it haunts them one by one in terrible, terrifying ways. The place of the island is really scary and the inn is very scary and scaryly shot. It's a color film that reminds me of Daria Argent's work. Lighting is excellent and the decoration is perfectly scary. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. Horror effects are extreme, frightening and unforgettable. Cinema is great, and that brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots it as a horror star that should be shot: a lot of dramatic push-ins, persistent close-ups that gently detail Jan's gradual assets and moments that recall other great horror movies. There are hidden tributes to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "Shining", "Black Sunday", and of course "Exorcist". He does a great job and absolutely steals the show with moody and underrated performance. This does not mean that the rest of the cast is disappointing; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's fucking mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives him the best, but he is basically not a movie star and his television personality is getting his way. Blair and young Michael Manchester have amazing chemistry. The film is otherwise so violent and fearsome (in a good sense) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played the mother in "Monster Makers" in 2003, and her motherly scenes in this movie feel the same sensitive feeling). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of his last roles) plays a great witch and has the most amazing voice and accent. She was also perfectly cast with Blair. But it's Blair's film. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the hearkens movie back to "Exorcist II: Heretic". I think "witchcraft" is there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night", and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre work to date.
