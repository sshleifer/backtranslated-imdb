I saw the fine film leaving the college briefly. As I sat there happily and watched Alice move from a suppressed virgin to a sex adventurer, I wondered why her sexual encounter looked good. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the psycho-sexual stages of development, basically the shift in time to what part of the body and its accompanying stimulation gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what makes us happy. Alice's first meeting is bathed, with an emphasis on the genitals and down. Her next meeting is oral with dingaling Mad Hatter. I forgot the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice's meetings, but I remember how well they agreed. It's interesting to see some brains appearing on the skin than cliches. "I'm here to give you a pizza. Let's dig." I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career could be this movie as it was her first movie. And Reagan's tiring hypocrisy still had to leave this country when she was released, but in a way she influenced Mrs. DeBell. When Meese staged his anti-pornographic commission (to distract people from his own criminal activity), Meese hired anti-porn activists named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images she saw as child pornography. She saw the cover of "Alice" Mrs. DeBell did for Playboy and immediately announced that she had scientifically proven that Mrs. DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts of several cultivated women and a face of ten years old. Yeah, right.
