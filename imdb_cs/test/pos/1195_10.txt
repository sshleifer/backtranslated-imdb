The original Milo≈° Forman's HAIR was a perfect film that actually revealed how life has changed over the years, not only in the US, but especially in this country. One of the films in the film was to be used in other films that come after Hair, such as American Graffiti, etc. It was an original story with a touch of generational sadness. The characters in the film were like lone "cells" in the "body" that changed everywhere. Overall, a very good movie, maybe a little underrated. Annie Golden's role was small, but she did very well. It was a film that practically opened John Savage as an actor. One of the members of Chicago played his part well, though it was a small part.
