I went to see this movie with a family that was expecting a neatly convincing story like '' mr & mrs.iyer '' and returned home utterly disappointed. to keep going.15 Park Avenue does not try to answer questions or provide a moral solution to how to deal with a mentally handicapped. His intention is to express loudly and clearly the questions of every human being, reasonable or not, a sense of reality. it even gives me doubts about my biased sense of common sense. The security, slavery, satisfaction I find in my presence is in fact what I am, or indeed creates the illusion that everyone desperately and sometimes unconsciously cling to just false conscious neglected 'meethi' that exists in each of us in some way or another? so why anjali so maniacally does that point show off her mind power when she is really poisoned by realizing that she becomes a monster? aren't we all we think we're 'normal', really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable about it deep inside? Isn't it better to be happy and crazy than to create the impression of "normality" in suppressing fragility? Meethi bravely, insanely, honestly. And the company marks her as 'schizophrenic'. The end confused me at first, but then you realize that the bravery and sincere faith that met her took her where she wanted to go. she was looking for, not caring about what the company had to comment on her search. and they are seemingly "real" people - anjali, psychiatrist and jojo who will never reach anywhere. the family thinks I'm also schizophrenic when I try to understand a movie that's pretty much crazy. world.anyone others willing to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
