To defend this film, I have to repeat what I said earlier. The film is called Arachina, it has no name and I don't mean any name as in actors who play in a small movie. I have no name in mind because in your local high school he decided to make a film without a name and could have a $ 2 budget. So what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was never taken seriously, which will automatically take it from the worst list of movies. This list is only for the big budget of all the stellar films that get too serious. The movie Oscar comes to mind, most of the films by Sylvester Stallone. The two leaders were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did well for this movie. The woman kicked her ass and the guy wasn't a stupid idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played the anal retention professor was not Clifton Webb, but he did divine work. And Bimbo played two competent actors for lack of better. I laughed at 50 cents of special effects. But that was part of the movie's magic. It played as a hybrid Tremors meets the Night of the Living Dead. The film's premise is like all the giant films of the 1950s. Meteor or radiation disrupts the ecosystem, and before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. This time, the meteor caused problems. I was very entertaining. I didn't expect much and I go much more than I bargained.
