If you like shoot em up westerns it is the goalkeeper. I thought the movie was fun watching and seeing people I didn't see in a while. I'm not an expert, but I liked it. The city and the props, etc., seemed to fit in. This is not Western, not enough people and budget. Costumes and firearms were correct! I expect to see young actors in the film in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) members who contributed to this effort were pretty well. I hope to see more.
