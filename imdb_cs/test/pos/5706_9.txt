When I tuned in to my local PBS station last night to watch "The War That Made America". I was expecting a boring document, instead I got a very good and believable reenactment of the major events of that time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution and the part played by the Indian Wars. Larry Nehring is George Washington, and he's perfect for that part. The story to the camera also works fantastically. I look forward to next week to see the rest. It's good to see PBS really using the HD format to bring 1700 straight into our living room. I hope Larry Nehring is seeing more in the future because he's such a talented actor.
