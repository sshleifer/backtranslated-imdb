I have to be old because I was riveted to this film for the first time I saw it. I'm watching it right now on HBO. It's a very simple movie of 2 people who fall in love after finding out that the couple have an affair. The fence is very thin, but the actors behaved very well in this movie. In a mixture of Kristen Scott Thomas running for Congress and Harrison Ford being an internal affair cop, these two meet, in unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Great fits. One thing I can't lose, this movie had a budget of $ 68 million. Was it to spend? Airplane crash or Harrison Ford pay?
