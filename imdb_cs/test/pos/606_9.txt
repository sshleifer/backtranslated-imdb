MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A misunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most distinctive films. It may seem fun to talk about the film as being "misunderstood", but people seem to remember it mainly for Jerry Juhl, for Paul Williams's screenplays. While these things are undoubtedly great as well as the formal playfulness of the film (screenplay-in-screenplay, film break, etc.), what sets the Muppet film apart from other Muppet films is a serious, wise procedure that runs through the image. It's a road movie, okay, but like most movies on the road, the pleasure is how to get there, and achieving the goals of the characters is mitigated by the uncertainty and awareness that they can never come back. Throughout the film, we have shown that it is a show-business before the Muppets "did it": Piggy leaves Kermit without a second thought in a telephone call from his agent, Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of the performer's life on the way in his haunted " I'm going back there "One day, and worst of all, Kermit is constantly being tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants to commercialize his art for the wrong purposes." (We can only wonder what Henson would do after leading his family in the management of the company.) Kermit himself worries about the elections in the desert conversation scene, and the final number of the "Magic Store" asks if it's all worth it before concludes that it doesn't matter how it goes. All this is interrupted by the anticipated Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously terrible jokes, and of course it wouldn't work if it weren't. But the movie The Muppet Movie is not just another jokefest because the rest of the remaining Muppet movies would become. No, it's a beautiful, subtle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and commerce, and that's as effective as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
