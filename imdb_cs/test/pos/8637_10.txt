Mullholland Drive once again proves that David Lynch is a master of film expression. Last night, I witnessed a brilliant addition to the film's history. The performances are stunning, stunning scores and fascinating photos. David's ability to combine many elements of filmmaking into a unique and stunning film experience is undeniable. When I was watching Mullholland Drive, I couldn't help but realize that we were really blessed with David Lynch in this world. The cinema is also blessed, it turns out in David Lynch's films that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true film artist has a chance in this world and that we are truly blessed.
