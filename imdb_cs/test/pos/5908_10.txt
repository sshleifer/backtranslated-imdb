Jimmy Stewart brings the story of Charles Lindbergh to life when he almost tells the story when he crosses the Atlantic. It's well-groomed with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life. Franz Waxman scores is a brilliant skid and really gives the picture a heroic feel. One of Stewarts's best roles and this film can bring from time to time. Check out Murray Hamilton (Mayor in JAWS) as Bud Gurney. Published on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of several other classic Stewarts films. I consider Jimmy Stewart to be the greatest American actor and never see him in any movie I see, watch this picture and agree.
