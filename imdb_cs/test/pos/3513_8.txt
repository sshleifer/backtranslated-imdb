I've been waiting for almost 25 years to see a horror thriller that's hard to find, and I've done it since I was born on DVD. Of course, it didn't have the same impact on me as I would have seen it in the 1980s, but director Lieberman (his film "Squirm" is great) takes advantage of the beautiful Oregon site and takes time. develop characters, not just to be sent in a creative way. High note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really scary and adds to the barren driving that makes this great fun for genre fans. He has to see if you like underrated horror movies. To describe it, it would be an intelligent "fifth 13", sprinkled with tasty pieces of "Deliverance." With that side, there are some really cool & original moments like my favorite when a couple swimming in a lake and a guy disappearing underwater playing a trick on his gal - just when you think it's usual fear, she suddenly looks ashore and ... I honestly can't spoil it - just look at it alone. Also, the end is just one of those you just have to believe? It came out of nowhere and it's weird and wild! The DVD contains a commentary by Lieberman.
