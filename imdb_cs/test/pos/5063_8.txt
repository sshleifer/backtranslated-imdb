Taut, a current political thriller that focuses on the controversial US policy of extradition, another horrific Orwell phrase (side damages, someone?) For illegal interrogations, even torture of terrorist suspects by circumventing a proper legal process. The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, who is himself the target of fundamentalist suicide - a plot of a bomb, bringing together the two major conspiracies of the film. Both works very well, bombarding set-piece graphics and cooling in his realism, with his denouement revealed in a stylish memory of Tarantino-type flashback and the scene of torture on an innocent man also steadfastly portrayed in all their cruel detail. The film tells the story of using torture as a trusted means of intelligence - gathering in a war against terrorists and against an uncontaminated formless bureaucracy (here embodied by a suitable refrigeration Meryl Streep, as a CIA chief who carelessly gives a extradition order) that can destroy innocent lives. Do not mind Kafka's fiction, think more about the recent killing of an innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, when the head of the Metropolitan Police was still staying, and no one attempted to murder a poor man. Acting is excellent - two key roles of innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and narrated reported by unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly, Yigal Naor, as the intimidating chief of police and Zineb Ouhach, as his idealistic loving daughter, loyal to their performances, their lack of confidentiality (at least to me), increasing the credibility of their characters. Of the larger Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal grows with the following films, playing originally separate but later conscientious - hit and anxious government men who do the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays his upset double part in one key but is just as credible as David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin are convincingly demonstrating the self-service senators and their footmen who will be helping you for so long until their career prospects are threatened. There are several weaknesses; there is little dramatic need to create "tension" around El-Ibrahimi's escape, and Streep's character may be too obvious as a bogey-man / woman. The worst of all is the absurd inclusion of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend on the spot, just for the sake of decoration and a short gratuitous love scene. Overall, however, it is a stunning idea - a provocative film experience.
