"Beyond the Clouds" is an over-the-top artsy group of four vignettes each offering a look into a man-woman relationship from gentle to tumultuous. Although the film offers excellent cinematography, some wonderful visual beauty and the cast of fine artists, there is little meat on the bones of this fragmented work. The taste of the relationship cannot bring its fullness, and synergism suggests that much more can be achieved with one story in 2 hours than with four. However, "Beyond the Clouds" will feed the dilettante and visual holiday for all, though superficial, stilted, and absent basically.
