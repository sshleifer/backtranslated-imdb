Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote to Mishima, thus clearly drawing parallels between Yukio Mishima's life and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and a fateful day when Mishima held the army's general hostage and spoke to the crew to taunt him and his ideals of Bushido samurai code. Mishima committed ritual seppuku on November 25, 1970 and planned it as a shot of beauty, art and action. Schrader edits the scenes that renew this day with three different scenarios from the Mishima novels: The Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoko House and Runaway Horses. The moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax by dragging the camera while zooming. Black and white sequences blend with the color moments shown in Mishima's novels. Black and white scenes represent Mishima's childhood and youth memories. Schrader corrects some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels, which often parallel with Mishim's real life, such as his stuttering, the development of his obsession with bodybuilding, and his growing samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is documented in selected depictions of the relevant novels. The color sequences resemble the early, stagnant Technicolor films, which give the film perhaps the intended surrealistic quality of the subject. Ken Ogata plays a real Misha with a steadfast determination, heading to the General's office that fateful day and resembles a real Mishima. With this film, Schrader struggled with a focus on the novels he did, and thematically tied to Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. The cut of the film between the three main sections of November 25, 1970, black-and-white segments growing up and colorful novel scenes clearly shows the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art, and activity in Mishima's life. Sometimes it is difficult to watch and for the uninitiated viewer there may be little. *** of 4 stars.
