A movie that someone had to do. Waco: The Rules of Engagement discuss the evidence behind Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of David David's estate and alleged government cover. Br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know about this film: you will see short but disturbing photos of the victim's organs. This is not done for the shock value, but to show points about how they died, as if you were present at the coroner's inquiry. The second thing you should know about this movie: for two and one quarter of an hour, it's pretty cumbersome - especially if you watched the events closely at the time. If you are not aware of any event other than that reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you know is an official government report, it may be a necessary display. If on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit neapolgetically one-sided) version of the events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie". In short, this is largely a definitive documentary. About this tragic event, and being very sober, but as a work of filmmaking, could test your patience, especially if you have a brief attention. And it is sometimes superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearing and the 60 minute report. Maybe once someone will make a document that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre string of events that led to the ATF raid or the psychological fight tactic that the FBI used to blast rock music in the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all the rock musicians themselves) who picked up their instruments and turned their massive amplifiers out to shoot their own music back directly at them.
