This is a story of long and embarrassing love. It depicts the daily life of a woman aged 50 and some people around her. Her everyday life is so ordinary and routine that I initially doubted who the real leader was. Then the audience knows that the woman and the man who was her high school classmate had very little connection. The woman did the same job - milk and supermarket - so long. There are so many slopes that the supply of milk bottles is a very difficult job. The man married another woman who now dies of cancer. She works in the town hall and devotes herself to her at home. They never look straight or talk to each other, but never forget each other. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese name means "You read books on some days." But of course, when the man said, "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do", it was to hug her and make love to her. He writes on radio disc jockey that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". Dreaming about that day, she was sublimating a desire in hard work and reading a book. I personally know a woman who has long loved a man, even though he married another woman and died because of an accident. Therefore, setting a story is not so strange. Rather, this film well portrays the unspoken romance in many ordinary men and women. Through this film you will remember your romance, which is long lost. This is a permanent effect movie.
