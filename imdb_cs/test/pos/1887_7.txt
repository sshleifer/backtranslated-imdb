Okay, so I like silly movies. If you like silly sci-fi movies, through the best movies, or if you're a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I'd go see this movie. This movie is all I wanted it to be. Be a fan through the best movies, this fit account. Every time I thought "this movie would be the weakest, the best movie if * * * happened ..." then it would happen as I thought * would be empty *. It's a wonderful stupid movie. If you're a Campbell fan, I'd say you see it, bring your friends, laugh. It is fun. It's not a classic or anything, but if there's a night on TV, watch it. It happened to me as a movie that I would write under "benevolent films". Movies that may not be good, but after a busy day of work, I could come home and watch, (this list also includes 'harold and kumar go to white castle', 'army of darkness' and 'unbearable cruelty') < br /> If you feel you are on top, amazingly slightly bad movie, watch it. if not go to rent "Bubba Ho-pulse"
