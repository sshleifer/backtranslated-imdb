This is a movie that will certainly brighten your day. Kermit Frog, is just a common frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs to be in the movie (lol). On the way, Kermit meets Fozzie the Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his Chicken Camilla, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But Kermit is also the owner of Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Nogs. Kermit and the Muppets do it to Hollywood. This film is recommended to all, young and old. The Rainbow Connection, "I'm Going Going Back There Once," and "Movin 'Right Along." The Muppets also uses many forms of transport in this movie, Kermit Ride, Fozzie Control Studebaker, and the other car, \ t Helium Balloons (one of my favorite moments by the way), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets are finally going to the rest of the way by bus Electric Mayhem (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter, and Animal), who meet them in the desert after Fozzie's car breaks. Even some Sesame Street Muppets make a portrait look (ie Big Bird walks the road, on the way to New York to break up on public television) The end is also a very pleasing moment, every Muppet created is in the last scene. ng with the final repeat of "Rainbow Connection". But the poor Muppets have worked so hard on their movie file, then it all comes down to drop and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks. Do you think everything is destroyed and destroyed, but the rainbow finally shines through the roof, and all this sums up the magic of this movie and you know everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you'll be charmed by the fun and sadness of this movie.
