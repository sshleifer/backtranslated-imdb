When you go to the Rendition, I was expecting an exciting movie on a controversial topic with big-name actors. I wasn't expecting a movie that was so exciting, exciting, poetic and sad that it took me from the beginning and didn't let me go, even when I left the theater. A word for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't let your policy come in the way of enjoying this movie. Take what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I am a black sheep, a pseudo-liberal college student) and thought it would be written as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with excellent performances (they wanted to imagine film critics). Sadly, a movie like this must be sold by its oscar-affiliated actors while leaving the constantly underestimated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like truly excellent Metwally. The whole cast gave good performances, some performed much more than others; My only problem with that was that there was a lot going on that didn't allow a lot of screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt like a "sub-plot" with Fatima and Khalid was as prominent on the screen as Anwar's part of the story. The characters all have the potential to get into stereotypes, but the actors do a pretty good job of giving them depth with a little screen time they have. Streep is really amazing, like a heartless senator, and like me, I don't want to see an actress in such a terrible role that she can't trust her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of Oscar's nods to this film, sometimes seems a bit uncertain. H tries to portray his inner conflict, but usually he just gets lost as if he either forgot his lines or doesn't know how he should feel. Sarsgaard performed excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is one of the best parts of the film. Meanwhile, he was amazing again and I hope to see him in more mainstream movies. It's a pity that Gyllenhaal will probably be nominated with him before him. Yigal Naor, as you can see on IMDb, is already a few films, but in my eyes he is a newcomer. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, all gave great performances. The story of Fatima and Khalid was not appreciated in advertising, but it brings sad humanity to the story. The story was interesting because I was trying to really combine both stories until we were clearly told at the end. I read some comments that say a love story is useless, but I disagree. I think it certainly shows another side of the controversial issue as well as humanity in general. Khalid was a real terrorist, but he did it to avenge his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, you see the human side through the story of Fatima. Not that I think we should feel bad for real terrorists, but I think the topic "we are all people" was definitely relevant. Whether your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc. Any theater. The bottom line is that it's an interesting story with a message we all have to hear.
