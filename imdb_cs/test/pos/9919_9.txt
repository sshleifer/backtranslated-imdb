Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other film Argento I saw was Suspiria and it ripped me out with my style, colors and scary story. . Next, I decided to go with Opera, as I was told it was one of his best. Man, I think I've discovered what will eventually be one of my favorite horror directors. The opera is about a young opera singer who gets his big break when Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is subconscious, so she becomes part of herself. It is a pity that there is a psycho after her, who watches her looking at the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers. Wow, he heard good things about it here, but I wasn't ready for the level that the movie would take me to. Yeah, the film has its shortcomings, which I can get to later on. But for the most part the movie went away. First, this movie is not as full of colors as Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like a suspension in this department, but no, to my surprise he had his own look and feel. The film is somehow colorless. It has a lot in colors in certain scenes (such as master kitchen / living room sequences) where Argento fills the screen with lush greenery and blues, but for the most part the film has a grayish, black tone to make it all out and I liked it it has your own distinctive look. The real stars of this show are the incredibly well-ordered death sequences. Wow. Every scene of death was like a work of art. Beauty in Destruction. These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences; these deaths have been carefully designed to shock and make the most of his situation. Every second of them loved, there is a lot of blood and chaos, but in style. But it does not harm you. Then there's the direction. Man, this is really original and beautiful footage. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this. Did you think Tarantinos shot Kill Bill vol. 1 where the bullet coming from the gun chamber was original? This is the movie he picked him up from! I sincerely believe this particular movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the feature creation that mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver comes to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of that. Anyhows, Tarantino's links aside, this movie has some amazing camera shots, like those crow scenes flying through the crowd in the opera house ... great stuff. And the main reason why Argentos has become one of my favorites. Most of the cast was fine, but Cristina Marsillach was the best of all as a tortured young opera singer Betty. The looks in her eyes for the murders were great. The rest of the cast was a bit wooden and tough, but nothing to deter your enjoyment of the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't like much in this movie. The first logic was thrown out of the window in some scenes. Especially those who included Bettys reaction after shes saw murders. It seems to me that she has gone the longest about her business, not telling anyone about the thing. Not the police either. I mean, if you see someone brutally murdering a loved one before your eyes ... you don't go out of the murder scene and continue your life. Someone would connect her to the murders. She could even become a suspect herself ... but not. Also, the end is a little anti-climactic. You'll have to see it to understand, but it seemed a bit unnecessary as the movie ended, it was like it might have ended sooner. It wouldn't be so superfluous. But that's about it, it's not really big trouble for me because I enjoyed the rest of this beautiful movie. I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I devour every step as if I ate a plate of the most expensive caviar. These guys are really good. I am thinking of his films as works of art and I have only seen two of them! You can't wait to discover the rest of his movies. Argento, you man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 of 5
