This short, which won an Oscar, spawned two sequels and a television comic strip, has a minimal animation but a breathtaking script (Theodore Geisel aka Dr. Seuss) and aneven more memorable and charming main character. UPA pioneered an animation style that even influenced Disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. That's at their best. God to have it in print. Highly recommended.
