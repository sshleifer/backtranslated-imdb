It was a great 1981 movie that had a great story about three men and two girls who go camping together and walk through dense forests and high mountains with a great drop of water. This group of people came across the property owned by George Kennedy (Roy McLean), who plays the role of a forest guard and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these young people that there is no camping space where they go and they should return. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and continue to bathe in nude water falls and play great music and dance by the fire and have a lot of beer and wine. There's an old wooden school house that draws girls and boys inside, and the film is starting to frighten it. There is one opportunity for a young girl to climb a tree to get away from a human beast who longs for her body and begins to mow the tree down to catch it. Don't miss this movie, there's plenty of everything.
