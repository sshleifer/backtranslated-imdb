The thing that makes "fire" even more attractive than magic art is its touch of femininism and rebellion. In my opinion, the character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian female protest against Indian society. The title of the film and the scene in which Radha goes through the flames in her kitchen are a symbol of the Latvian Hindu mythologist Sita's wife, who goes through the fire to prove her impeccability, according to the same narrative that appears in the film. The film could be a great inspiration for women, especially those in the subcontinent, to seek their freedom and control their lives.
