"The Aristocats" is classic Disney's the best. It's not considered the ultimate Disney classic beside the more famous Disney movies, but it's a great and fun movie that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is certainly a sure kids-pleasure because it has all the components for a fun children's movie. I like it as a child. I'm not sure if this movie is a pleasure for adults to watch Disney nostalgia, but I'm still enjoying this movie as a young adult. The story, "Aristocats" may not be as complicated or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made when filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were a story and a wise version that "aristocats" certainly show. Characters make a movie; they are all nice, entertaining, have great lines and have a great interaction. Voice actors are also part of the character creation so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and etc.). The misconception could have been Napoleon and Lafayette because they are showstoppers and have little to do with the real story, but fortunately they are fun and fun characters and scenes with them are pure gold. > <br /> "Aristocats" is both fun and cute, but it's also very funny cartoon. The style of animation and appearance fits perfectly into the French film environment (especially the city of Paris looks great). Character animation and design is great. And the songs are also very catchy. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title track is a cute song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and an unforgettable show-stopper "Everyone wants to be a cat". And George Burns' score is perfect for cinematic funny and emotional situations. Overall, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon of the 70's and it's a film that deserves to be seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do your favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. They deserve to be in their memories.
