This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is jolly because the accident prone moron and David Spade is perfect to play straight-man at Farley. The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene in which two of them are in the car singing with The Carpenters Superstar is a classic. Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had amazing potential - unfortunately, he will be missed. /> <br />
