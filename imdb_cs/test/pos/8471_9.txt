I'm not saying anything new when I say "Ray" was magnificent. As I praise this film, I must mention something that distinguishes it from other films. Very rarely it is a film made exclusively by an actor. "Ray" was simply created by Jamie Foxx. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx, "Ray" would be just another interesting and informative biology. I always thought Foxx was funny, stemming from his days with "In Livin 'Color" and "The Jamie Foxx Show," and I knew he was talented when using his own show ("The Jamie Foxx Show" ). show off your musical talents. But I never imagined he could take such a role away. I don't know much about playing and what they're doing to get into character or other things like that, but what I saw from Jamie Foxx was extremely impressive. He wrapped himself in this role and saw Ray Charles rather than an actor depicting Ray Charles. The story of "Ray" was a great yes, but it was given the life of Jamie Foxx.
