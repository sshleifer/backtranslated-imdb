Oh my god ! I can really say that Maya Angelou is one of the most interesting and important people in the world, especially my culture. She is incredibly inspiring and her story is a story of a great woman! When I first picked this movie, I thought it was great together and now you can see it in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite PoetEss and now one of my favorite actresses and speakers. I believe it is the greatest of all time. This film had me on the edge of my saddle and reached for Kleenex while reminding me that no matter where you come from, if you decide to be great, then you'll be great! And Ester Rolle played a great support role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now "I know why they sing birds in a cage."
