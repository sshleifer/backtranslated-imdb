Like Margot in "Fear of Fear", he becomes a victim of his ambitious husband, such as Fox in "Fox and His Friends", is driven to suicide by his friend who took all his money, like the Xaverl Bolwieser in "Stationsmaster's Wife" Prison to make his wife cheat a chance to get rid of him, just like Hermann Hermann, who seeks refuge in insanity to flee his stupid woman and bankrupt society, so Hans Epp is the victim of the German company "Wirtschaftswunder" after RW Fassbinder's World War II "The businessman of the four seasons". Simply because Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women, as well as between heterosexual and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favor any sex. In the case of Hans Epp, there are women who lead him into despair, illness and ultimately death. When he returns from the Foreign Legion, where he flew because he could no longer withstand his mother's pressure, he complains that he is still alive while a good boy from her neighbor was killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but his foreman is surprised to be seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a low-income fruit merchant who shifts from backyard to backyard, "shouting" his produce. His mother, one of his sisters and her husband, are ashamed of having such a "street worker" in their family. "The love of his life" (no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his work does not fall within her social status and origin. So he married Irmgard, whom he does not love and who does not love him. From constant pressure, he runs into him drinking. One evening, when his wife watched him, he explodes and hits her. He runs away to his family they've just been waiting for. When Irmgard calls a lawyer for divorce, Hans suffers from a heart attack. Imrgard decided to stay with him, but from now on he is no longer allowed to do hard work and drink alcohol. So it starts to feel more and more unnecessary, calmer and quieter and more and more depressing. When he finds out that Irmgard is cheating on him, he decides to end his life, but not as Hermann Hermann by embarking on a trip to the madness of light, but he drinks himself to death before Imrgard, their little daughter and his friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. But the question is: Did Hans just kill himself because he couldn't endure his miserable environment or did self-justice?
