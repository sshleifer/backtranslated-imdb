I love this movie, especially because Mark Wahlberg is in it, and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this movie that sucks you in and makes you feel all the emotions the characters feel. Only Aniston is great as a girlfriend in this movie. Check out the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back during the day (perhaps they just got smarter these days). It takes over a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle aspects to light through. As a diamond, this film shines. You won't lose your popcorn on this. A half chick, but my husband also enjoyed it. Also there are some laughs.
