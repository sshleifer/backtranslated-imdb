I first saw all Rivers Run on TV when I was a kid and loved it. It was great to see a mini-series that was set up and filmed in place so close to home. He lived quite close to Echuca, I loved going to the historic harbor to see paddle steamers. The first I ever rode was Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I love how long it takes for events to happen. Nothing happened because most of the movies are today. Acting was fantastic. All Rivers Run were perfectly cast and I only like the Philadelphia crew. Mac is always fun to watch with his trademark raw onion sandwich after a great night. Easily deserves 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series of all time along with the Dirtwater Dynasty.
