As the war for the Soviet Union did not go well, Stalin accepted the volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock units. This is the story of one such battalion. There are small crooks, political prisoners, soldiers dug from other troops, gray-haired veterans of the White Army and some dangerous criminals. They are thrown into the battle poorly equipped, untrained and face the threat of NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. Special effects are rudimentary and many smaller characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen a subtitled or dubbed version. The show's display required the liberal use of a pause button and an explanation from native speaker Russian.
