Fast times are not. But look at this movie, my heart. Pour a drink and enjoy. It is loaded with the killing of just beginning stars. Sherilyn Fenn has her first attached canvas on the screen. Chris Penn, Lea Thompson, Eric Stotz, Jenny Wright, Rick Moranis, etc. - they all look so young. Oh, and if you look closely, Nancy Wilson's wife is from the rock band Heart.
