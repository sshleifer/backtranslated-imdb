so I disagree with the critics, but I really wasn't what this movie moved. I was a little hesitant to rent it because I go through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to experience. yet I rented it and thought that I could experience some catharsis, or at least understand that I was not alone. Even though I understood the protagonist's irritation by his careless cousin, I did not feel his inner struggle with isolation as I wish. I felt that much more emphasis was being placed on his disturbing cousin, who overcame his welcome. It's a beautifully shot film and I really appreciated the use of silence to feel the feeling of isolation.
