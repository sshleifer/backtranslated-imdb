Who doesn't love the muppets?! It is impossible to watch them without getting any warm, blurred feel. So, I think it's important that this movie seems to have very successfully captured what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot, but about the different moments and characters in the movie that I remember quite kindly. In fact, it was quite the nostalgic atmosphere of the whole movie, but without any self-confidence in the wrong way. Refreshing for someone who might be too hanging on careful details and technique; "Magic" goes beyond all other things. It's really what movies are made of. <br /> <br /> How does the movie achieve these things? Hmmm, nice question! Did I attack? See you. Indeed, I feel that it is quite simple. The creators believe in their material and don't take it too seriously. I would probably not say that the film has many really inspired moments, but it has a life for it (that it's strange enough that many "real people" are missing). Taste. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have some innocence about them, which makes them all the more cute. In general, I have the impression that people who made the film are not afraid to try anything they dreamed of. time that gives the whole thing a pretty free feeling. Something like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent, little predictability and lots of warm personalities. Of course, the apartments were a lot of nice surprises. Maybe I don't feel like I have much to say about this because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or when I was writing this review). By the way, here I am a little repetitive, but I really liked the sense of family. It's full of love you might say. He recalls the feeling of nostalgia that many films do not do so effectively or effortlessly. And once again, one of the best spells of the film is its very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Just as Nathaniel Hawthorne's fortune for being a (like) butterfly, the Muppet movie will succeed in part by not trying to do so. Just as beauty is best undiscovered or untouched or forced or something like that. By the way, if it sounds contented, I also count that it was quite hilarious. So, in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult to make a smile on. Plus there's a lot of great music! Very recommended to all people, young and young in the heart.
