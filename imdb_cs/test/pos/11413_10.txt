Don't listen to most of these people. Wrong give you a better review of this movie that I and my friend love! It's Jill Johnson, played by Camilla Belle, who watches in Mendrakis's house and someone breaks in. anyway, don't listen, "worst acting". She has amazing acting. with a great story. I think there are two advantages Jill has. 1. is a fast runner and is on the team track. 2.she got alive! lol. It's a great movie and quite scary. look at it, you will be satisfied with this masterpiece. don't listen to other people on the web. it is very good. Trust me, I'm good at reviewing movies. I'm a future film critic. I want to buy this movie. and you will also be when you see it. it's amazingly amazing.
