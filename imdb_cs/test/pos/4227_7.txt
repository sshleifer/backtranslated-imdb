This film illustrates a certain brand of horror-comedy horror comedy, but quite different from Troma's films (with which it shares certain qualities). Humor is rude and ready, but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​nasty dolls with bad powers and twisted brains doesn't mean shrugging you with boredom, you reach for a six-member beer and enjoy the best movie "Chucky".
