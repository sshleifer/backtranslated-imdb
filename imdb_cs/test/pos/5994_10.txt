I slowly go through so many action-packed Hong Kong action movies as I can get my hands and hit this gem - especially thanks to Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. It's a great action movie, though not as an OTT, as the title might suggest. It moves at a great pace and is really enjoyable. The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It would seem that Rob Dougan - the guy who made the 'Clubbed To Death' song that was popular in 'Matrix' picked up the Big Bullet soundtrack and compiled into one of the songs on his 'Furious Angels' album; this melody is called "I no longer ride" and is also the opening melody of the TV series "Law and Order" and the introductory song on the head of "Matrix Reloaded" DVD menu! This really surprised me because of complete agreement!
