This is definitely not the best movie ever. But it is definitely worth seeing people with a special kind of mind. So the one who loves sadness and depression, and the scary fairy tales at night, and wolves and real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only endure it once ... But since wolves and Saint-Lucy, and children's drawings and headless Christ live in my nightmares.
