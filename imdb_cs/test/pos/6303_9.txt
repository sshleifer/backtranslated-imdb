Le Conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully crafted film that takes small carefully placed steps towards its end to be enjoyed to enjoy. From contrasting landscapes, through a tightly closed world in which the hero lives, we are recruited by the director and controlled from the moment we enter the hotel. We, like a hero, will never escape from the choking intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven mafia world. The fact that the film resists and enjoys the Mafia's stereotypes is all the more successful. Concrete grave, inevitable brutal executions and stunning masculinity are bare and exposed to what they are. Just brutality and business and nothing more. Life is about being part of a corporate machine that is an organized crime and not about love or life for yourself, family, or others. Our hero is truly a hero in giving up his life because of the touch of a beautiful bartender, solving the suffering suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel and escaping his decorative prison. The consequences of love are truly beautiful and at the same time brutal. You see it!
