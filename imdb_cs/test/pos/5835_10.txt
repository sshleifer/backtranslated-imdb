A horrific series about life in Oz - an experimental prison trying to rehabilitate prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in the face and full of strength. It's also one of the best written dramas ever written. on TV and almost all actors are just great. Since it was on the cable, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There's a lot of racist comments, but it's for all races. In fact, white characters look pretty bad (especially the Aryans) and black characters get better (loving Muslims). Hispanics do not have a strong role and there are no Asian prisoners at all. All the prisoners seem to be constantly and willing to kill someone who notices a moment, but with some of them you still feel sympathetic. Even guards, counselors, and doctors in jail have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting this BUT - don't buy it. I have a whole collection and, to be honest, I don't think I want to see her again. It is an incredible television, but so grim, dark and depressing. I guess I have to sell everything online. I'll give him 10.
