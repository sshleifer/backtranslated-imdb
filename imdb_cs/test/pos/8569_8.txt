H.O.T.S. is a fun movie for the journey back when skin splashing has a more positive program full of fun. They were made simply to make titillat and have a few laughs. Everything seems less cynical and exhausted. Girls have natural characters and some are playboy playmates. A simple conspiracy deals with a group of young women who open a disapproved sorority house to return to snooty girls who have rejected and insulted them. Instead of today's medium temperament tricks, most hijinks are simply innocent fun. Women are decent actresses for this genre and are usually very attractive. To keep the attention between topless scenes, we have a mafia follower, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother and the cheapest robot he has ever seen. There's even Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy light entertainment.
