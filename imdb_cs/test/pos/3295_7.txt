"Challenge to free" was one of the first movies I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I owned. I haven't seen a movie in years, so yesterday I decided to stick the tape and watch it. Wow. The story is as powerful as when I first saw it. I think now that I'm older, I can better evaluate the values ​​that are implanted in the movie. (Self-esteem, value of freedom and love of nature) It's certainly a "B" movie, but it's the one you will remember for years, especially when you see it as a child.
