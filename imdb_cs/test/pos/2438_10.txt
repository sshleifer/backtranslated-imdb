Well, I don't know much about anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, funny, simple and pleasing. In other words, it was all that was decided to be. The story takes place around the first love of the girl (as the name suggests) and I should definitely warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in the subject line. It's a child's drawing. It's really just a simple story, but it's well said, and it keeps your attention well. Finally, it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
