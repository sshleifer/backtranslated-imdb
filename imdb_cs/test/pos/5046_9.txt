This film won the best prize at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It's an American title probably in the spring. Acting is excellent. The story takes you to the life of an elderly man who takes what life does to him and does it a little bit. Despite his best friend (and partner in not-so-serious crime), he puts people on every occasion, but still often reveals his heart of gold. His long-standing wife came to her subtle end and made a decision that changes her life and which is heartbreaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
