I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty good. I've never had a chance to see it. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I felt I should watch it. After all, I like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you like these movies, you can get a kick from "The Cell". The whole story is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say that wasn't that great, but she does a credible job. I would recommend for a scary thriller. <br/> 7/10
