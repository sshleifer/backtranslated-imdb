I was never sure if I liked this document or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before the reduced version of Revelations, and is on the Revelations video tape before the uncut show. The documentary is essentially friends Bill says how big he was in an hour with video clips of the mixed show, a bit like a trailer for the movie you're about to watch. It also features David Letterman groveling as a worm for dumping Bill off his show before he died, reason? Bill joked about how Pro-Life people should collect funerals, and Letterman had Pro-life advertising. Anyway watch the video as Revelation is Bill's best ranting :)
