I read the movie and thought it would be a cute, good feeling from Saturday night. I didn't expect anything big, I think it's mostly fluff, but hopefully it won't be a bad experience. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good, and they spilled nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn into an unpleasant moment for something touching was pleasant to see. He could turn this character into something we all had seen before, but instead they broke away from stereotypes and focused on the character's humor. It was amazing to see Jonathan Caouette again, I didn't know what to do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a gem, a great young actress character who hopefully gets more work. There are times in the movie that could do some work, but it's not a bad time at the cinema. My friend described it as gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but it's more. It's a character study of how it is growing up a homosexual in a small town, the pain is there, but the humor behind that pain (that only age can be clearer) is increased. I look forward to seeing more Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
