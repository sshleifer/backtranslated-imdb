Curse of the Monkey Island. Excactly released 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. Do you think that with Monkey Island 2 is a weird ending that would finish Monkey Island once and for all. But it turned out to be a trick that attracts Guybrush into captivity. But enough is that Monkey Island has returned and voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts created the movie Monkey Island, it would be what it would look like, and it sounds so. It's conspiracy is really good, and everything about it is just amazing. If you haven't heard of Monkey Island, buy Monkey Island Archives or The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all the games starting with The Secret of Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but all this is all.
