Ham actor without penny. Who should play such a character as Michael Caine? He's totally and utterly cheerful, but like most of Caine's performances, he's behind him. It seems that the film is a show of Dylan Moran and is amazing in his double talks with Caine. However, this is where it is shrinking. Moran's impersonation should be incorporated in a rather organic way. They are too much in themselves, and the potential credibility of the conspiracy springs from the window. Does not matter. Give it if you can find it. There's enough to make it a pleasant journey.
