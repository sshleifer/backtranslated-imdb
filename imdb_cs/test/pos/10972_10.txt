MANNA FROM HEAVEN is an amazing movie that is both predictable and unpredictable. You know that the characters after finding that the so-called "gift from God" is actually a loan will return the money and everyone will be happy at the end, but not as obvious as they get there. Often the scenes are funny and sometimes touch how the characters evaluate their lives and where they go. The cast of veterans is more than just nostalgia. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove they can do more than play Riddler, Mother Partridge, or Mary's girlfriend Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play different characters than we saw on their TV series. At the same time, the depiction of Ursula Burton's nun is both moving and funny, without making her sisters or church fun. If you're looking for a movie with amazing casts, some good music (including Shirley Jones's "The Way You Look Tonight") and uplifting ending, try this. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
