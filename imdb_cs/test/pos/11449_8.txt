A bunch of predominantly uncomfortable and grossly unwavering teens go to the haunted, distant, neglected old mortuary located near the cemetery to attend everything that happens on Halloween, organized by the strange occult-obsessive freaks Mimi Kinkada and her helpless boy. hungry bimbette friend Linnea Quigley. Loutish, profane, beer-pet, sex-happy measure of dimwits holding s√©ance as a joke (a very bad idea, 'because a desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, this unexcused seance awakens those definitely grumpy and hostile evil spirits, killing and frightening most of the children, transforming them into ugly, fuzzy, clawed, fervent faces of murderous ghouls who cause the usual terrible disaster throughout the country. The duration of a particularly long, dark and tormenting night of pure terror. Yeah, that's basically your umpteenth vigorously graphic and relentless Wall-to-Wall cheap shock-ridden "Evil Dead" rehash, filled with Enclosed, there's no easy way to come out of a claustrophobic single self the limited environment, the indiscriminately redundant spraying kits, the continually striking hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, the gloom'n'doom-tuned gloomy nightmare feeling, and the vivid face-to-face cinematography (anticipated hyper-active camera work, fluent, smooth tracking footage, crazy camera angle titles, even a dolly camera that makes a sliding 180 degree figure gracefully). Luckily, Kevin S. Tenney is a slick, confident, stylish direction that keeps an extremely scratched and derived steering pile up together on a quick clip; In addition, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates some roughly energetic and enthusiastic grotesque spooky atmosphere ooga-booga carnival funway. However, Steve Johnson's amazingly bloody and imaginative makeup effects are a real star of the show. Among the bloodthirsty peak is the disgusting fat fool Hal Havins (who played a similarly irritating obese hole in the immortal "Sorority Babes in Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama") at the same time that his tongue was bitten, Quigley thrust the lipstick tube in one of her chest (yow!) and blackmail guy eyes while she is making love to him (double yow!), libidinous teenage couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (cat has her throat cracked while dude her arm is cut off), Kinkade put her hands on the fire, and in the film's worst scene, the average old man's throat slit from inside after eating an apple piece attached with razor blades. Beamed rock spots also smoke. And then there is Kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and fearless demonic dance, a hissing number accompanied by a flashing lightning light and surprising jump jumps that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, so overall it is nothing more than a totally helpless and senseless, albeit pretty, pretty, and vulgar sleazy fright fank junk piece, but if you're in the mood for the horror-fun fun corpses. It cheerfully crass and juvenile dross makes a cool trick.
