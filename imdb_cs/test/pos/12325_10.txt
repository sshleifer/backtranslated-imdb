I've watched thousands of movies in my life and I believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie ever made. I mean storytelling, storyline, acting, staging, working with the camera, and so on. (Indeed, this scene could play short.) In The Dead, every scene is perfect, so the whole movie is perfect. Maybe John Huston sold his soul to the devil to create such a movie. Hopefully Daniel Webster got him out of the contract!
