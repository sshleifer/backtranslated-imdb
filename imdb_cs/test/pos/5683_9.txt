One of the best horror / thrilling movies I've seen for a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and overwhelming on how good this movie is, sometimes a gem like this surface but is rare. I expected a popcorn monster to flick and slightly deflect the way to spend late at night, but instead a very well done and directing movie with great acting and done with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what's happening to them, and that's what you're doing there and it's really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare it to "Open Water," but I disagree because I thought Open Water was pretty boring and average, while the film was the opposite, though superficially shot in the same "realistic" style . Br /> <br /> Actors are unknown, at least for me, but they are all very effective and express a terrible situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and fluent, the story is logical, and it seems to be something that could happen, all the characters' actions and thoughts are what one would do and think. Very believable and that makes the film more real because of it. At the end I had tears in my eyes. I have to say that the film rarely has this effect on me, that's how powerful and emotional this movie was, and I really impressed the director and actors of this great film.
