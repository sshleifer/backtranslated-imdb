As a Dan Aykroyd fan, I watched this movie when he recently appeared on TV in the middle of the night. I didn't expect much, so it came as a big surprise that I loved it so much. This is the type of movie that Dan Aykroyd seems to love. A chance for him to "hammer" and not take things too seriously. If you loved him at The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you'll know what I mean, and you should be wise to try Couch Trip. Avid Aykroyd fans will also have fun and see all the tiny links to his other movies in the script! <br /> <br /> I can't describe this movie without messing it up, so all I can do is tell you. I can't praise this movie enough and it's definitely time to release the DVD !!
