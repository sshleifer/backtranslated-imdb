So Burt Reynolds describes this film, which has become his best. He plays Tom Sharky, vice president, who is on the way to an international gangster (Vittorio Gassman) and a man he finances to become the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In William Diehl's novel, the story is more complicated because the guy runs for president. This is a very long movie that feels more than three hours instead of two. Filming in downtown Atlanta and Peachtree Plaza sets the mood for the story. Reynolds does not laugh very much in this film compared to his comedy films. It is very serious here, especially at the beginning of the film, because it is degraded to a bust that goes wrong. Sometimes, however, the film plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime movie with Burt trying to get close to a gangster woman. It is only at the end of the film that the violence starts, leading to the climax of the bang. As well as the great jazz score by DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine offers an excellent soundtrack in urban jazz music with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flory Purim & Buddy De Franco, Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps manages to score magic. This film has become one of the best dramatic acts ever. Look at that. <br /> <br /> Score, 8 out of 10 stars
