I quote as a comment on this film under the words of my kind writer, Paul Coelho. <br /> <br /> "If you really want something, the whole universe will try to help you achieve it." It is too easy to forget who we are and what we want to do in life. Because there are always too many comments and advice around us to say security. I almost forgot how passion feels. Despite the adventure, I will be ripped out of the security zone, and I believe that fear is just the price I have to pay for the upcoming new journey in life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me with this beautiful story. It is a blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. This is the most precious love of soul light.
