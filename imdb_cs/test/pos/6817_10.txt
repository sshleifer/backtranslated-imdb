I was fortunate enough to see the screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before his debut at the 2005 Sundance Festival. the ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies an elegant direction, moving performances and a story that is heartbreaking. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like two lovers. And in his first attempt at dramatic narration, Leonard turns out to be a future-oriented director. I feel that this short film should be extended to include a feature film. It's hard to describe talent, but as this debut film shows, you know when you see it!
