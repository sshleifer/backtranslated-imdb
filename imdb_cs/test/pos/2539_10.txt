The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film only contributes to the strangeness of the powerful message of dierector BAbenco. The film is divided into two halves - the first in the reformatorium, where a group of young people is abused and violated by violent law enforcement agencies and guards. The second backdrop is a city where they are instead constrained by their own actions and morality, which involves mugging, pimping and killing various characters that enter their lives. Different gender roles and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is a mother and a lover for some of the children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both engaging and tragic. There is no lucky end to this story and I recommend watching it with caution because there are some very annoying scenes to watch especially for opening twenty minutes. However, it is important to observe that this is not just a fictional story. Actors are not trained professionals, but boys are selected from Sao Paulo Street. In fact, they lived this life, which is so vivid on the screen and in the da Silva case, died in the hands of the police, which is so brutally depicted. Document? Fiction. It borders on both, but it's definitely for a heartbreaking material, and it's a movie that won't leave you breathless and think long after you've seen it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
