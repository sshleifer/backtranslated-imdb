Although I was hoping to enjoy it, it was definitely an impressive film. It was a great performance of all leaders and a story, though not what I would call cold was still effective and keen on me. The best work of this film was for me to look at the picture because it always looked cool and damp and the film seemed to fit. I also thought that this low budget suited this movie because I don't think the film would have a sharp picture and clear sound in this movie. Everything that was considered was a little beyond my expectations, but I am still very happy to finally sit down to watch this movie.
