It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-1960s until just before the release of Star Wars. Until then, there were too many Hays Code parrots. With Star Wars, the green light shone so that most of the films were directed towards children and morons, a practice that continues today. SEVEN-UPS, the truth is said, contains a couple of torn lines of dialogue - "We can do it in an easy way, or we can do it hard" is one - but I'm damned if I can find anything else wrong. (In fact, this line may not be even when this movie was made.) SEVEN-UPS demonstrates everything that was right with the best films of the golden age: sparse dialogue, realistic gaming, real spots (winter in dirty New York never looked better / worse, propulsive stories, and yes, the best car chase ever made. Bill Hickman is a driver who pursues Scheider (you know him from Bullitt) and the chase structure is quite similar to McQueen's structure, but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity, pace, amazing details of schoolchildren. and a broken conclusion. (That bug, which is about 2 mph, always bothering me in the chase Bullitt.) Striped screechy scores Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. SEVEN UPS: bleak, grim, action-oriented, adult. This is a movie that can't be done today; There is no "trick" for kiddies or absurd endings. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: as long as police films are being watched, UPS SEVEN-UPS and its 1970s brothers (eg FRENCH CONNECTION) will set the standard.
