Where should I start? For the first time I saw this movie in 1995 and I had no idea what to expect, I was actually looking for movies in which Elijah Wood played and was highly recommended. I sat down and once watched the movie and didn't know what to think. A few days later I watched it a second time and the door opened. I've never cried before in my life when I watched a movie, and I'm blubbing, every tall and low movie I just went to next door on an emotional roller coaster. It struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and enthusiasm we see in the film, the miracle and innocence of childhood, the desire for the time it once was, but no more. This film reminded me, more than anything else, of my childhood (with the exception of torture) during my childhood shrugging in my life, and I didn't really notice it, gave it up and went on. life completely simple. The Radio Leaflet woke me up and suddenly realized what I had given up without noticing it. From that moment I was about to change my life and myself, and I did. This will sound shabby, but basically I rediscover my inner baby. over the last 6 years and has changed me so much, so much for the better, hugging and living of that part of myself. I found out who I am. I don't think it was just a case of the right movie that appeared at a crucial moment in my life, Radio Flyer really did something very special and I still look at it as an incredible piece of work in every way, an incredible movie. Finally, I can't mention music. I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer and he is one of his best works. The wide width and depth of the emotional expression he puts into this film is a huge part of what the film does, what it is for me. Like movie subtitles in a foreign language, his hovering music is the bed to the intense emotions that this movie will make you. Finding a soundtrack at any cost, it was sadly deleted long ago, I never expected to find it, but it did amazingly, after chatting with someone I met at a guest book by Hans Zimmer fansite. Watch this movie, let yourself live emotions, don't let the trivial nitping of the end, no matter what the baby is
