(Contains spoilers) Russia in the 13th century. The opening shot shows the remains of the last invasion: breaking uniforms, human skulls, and skeleton horses. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) pursued the Swedish army away and impressed the mongol ruler to such an extent that he suggests supporting him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky will say, "You will die in your homeland, but do not leave it". He wants to hunt, build ships and trade. But he warns against a more dangerous enemy: Closer, more mediocre, and no possibility to buy out: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: Mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. Marauding occupation forces divide looty. Rich traders want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalist Mr. R.), but "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander as their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. The Teutonic Knights feel invincible and have a smug smile for Russian women who helplessly testify to how their fathers and sons are defeated. Children are thrown into the fire, while senior dignitaries of the church look and stay idle. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and old Gavrilo and tall and cheerful Vasili. He promises to marry the noblest. Vasily calls Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav. The Prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike immediately. Even women put on chain armor ... The invaders want the bait of a "Russian bear," but Nevsky's stratagem is worth the test: Peipus Lake is his war zone: His men know the territory, but the Germans who are harder will break through the ice ... Open your eyes to watch the most impressive battle scenes ever shot. It's not just a lot of add-ons (who was, I think, compressed in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein's masterful management of so many individuals: displacing divisions like chunks on a chessboard, and almost every shot resembles that of Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses in fantastic dress). Russia in the winter looks scary in itself, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is hors concours. The stars of the corpses are immersed in cosmic light at the endless horizon. Olga and other women are looking for torches for the survivors at dusk. A devout falcon sits on his master's dead body while the crow waits for the right moment to choose the deceased's eyes. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. Of course, Nevsky is Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, good-looking, heroic and have a perfect hairstyle. The Germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku-Klux-Klan. The actor, who plays Vasily, performs one man's performance - four characters: the first wave, then the heroic, youthful lover and the comic relief. The main task of Cherkasov is to look heroic. Eventually the Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: He will forgive "little soldiers" and exchange knights for soap. Only a bearded killer and a treacherous cleric will turn to the crowd. He does not forget the last warning: Whoever comes with the sword will die with the sword ... He promised his promise. 10/10
