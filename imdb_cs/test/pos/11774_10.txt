Hardware Wars are a hilarious, 12-minute short movie parody of the original Star Wars movie, which was released just months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses home appliances like spaceships and Star Wars look-and-like actors to send you roll on the floor in uncontrollable laughter. This film won many awards at film festivals and was a film that inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie titled "Spaceballs". This is my favorite movie parody and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
