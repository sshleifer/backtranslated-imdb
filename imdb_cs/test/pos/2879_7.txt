Ladies and gentlemen, it's a really modern B-movie. The dialogue is stilted and comes with wooden stiffness, the assumption is predictable (there are a few decent twists) and the characters for most of them remain 2D. And yet there is a certain charm. WWE Wrestler Kane brings to life a sick, twisted monster of a man with a lot of pathos (though it is somewhat like his character playing around ten years), and so I find it quite fun when people say that "Not much for him," but Glen Jacobs is probably quite a nice guy, so he is, in any case, he is perfectly cast because the massive and deadly are well above the top (Jason would be proud), but I have heard at least four breaks The applause for the four different kills scenes Honestly going to this movie thinks you will have some fun and gorefest, oh this is a QUITE gorefest.R-rating is richly deserved and I actually got a little sick during some graphics times. case, very, very fun, but pretty bad, movie.
