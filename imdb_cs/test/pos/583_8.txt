I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters, back. When I saw it again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised how well it was. Gags are still funny, the interaction between characters works great and portraits look better than ever. (Steve Martin must be the best.) <br /> <br /> My kids (9, 11, and 14) loved it all, and the music is good enough to keep buzzing many days later. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you read at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show before you see the movie to feel the back story of the characters, otherwise the film won. So much sense.
