"The Love Letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very low, romantic comedy in which the use of the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks secret passions and desires for sleepy city dwellers. > <br /> It's not for all viewers. I feel that "The Love Letter" benefits from a simple and quiet tone. Never deliberately clumsy and fake like most romantic comedies is quaint, picturesque and comfortable. However, for exactly the same reasons, many viewers are bored and not interested. The cast is nice. It's great to see Tom Selleck again and it's a little underrated role. And it's hard to believe this is the same Kate Capshaw that we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and Temple Of Doom". He's quite naturally good here; Improvement in every role I have seen since I got on the nerves of Indy. And is it possible that Capshaw is getting nicer and more attractive with age? (What about Spielberg?) <br /> <br /> It's not much; But after another noisy summer movie season I'll probably look back with a short hobby for this world-like-a-feather romance.
