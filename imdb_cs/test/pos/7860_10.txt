Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film. He is sharply shot, graphic, without being visually graphic, well behaved by all involved, and covers some of the most taboo topics of any day in a workers', almost anticipated, norm that no one has ever seen in any other film by this reviewer. I didn't know what to expect to sit and watch it: a civil war movie or some kind of soft core of 70's with Eastwood coming down to school for girls in the south. But in reality there is not one of these things, but the exploration, exploration and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is the core of civilized. as one of the reviewers had previously noted, none - none - the characters are sympathetic by the end of the film and yet each is interesting, complex and puzzling. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier who found a young Pamelyn Ferdin (know the voice as soon as you hear it), a girl in a behavioral school headed by Geraldine Page amid the chaos that was a civil war - especially in the south. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, beautiful, young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties to Eastwood - everyone has their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. He plays girls away each other always trying to get a sexual advantage. In the emerging world we have some interesting things that have revealed latent lesbianism to incest. It is a masterpiece that has exceeded my expectations on every creative front. That could be (besides Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film. It's definitely one of Eastwood's best performances. the site is always so good and Hartman, Fe5rdin et al. the gothic building for the school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexual lacing scenes cancel. And what happens to Eastwood is the foot at most of the haunted, scary, demented film competition.
