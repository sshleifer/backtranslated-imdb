This is my favorite movie of all time !!! I remember seeing it when I was younger and in love with it since then. I used to rent it so often from this one video store that used it, and when we moved, I couldn't find it anywhere, so I went back to the store so I could watch the movie again! Br /> <br /> I finally found it for sale and bought it and watched it over and over again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then it was my first DVD I got after I got the DVD player ... OK well I got them at the same time, the quality on the DVD is so better I couldn't to believe it! You have to see this!
