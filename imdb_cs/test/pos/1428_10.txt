I saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and loved it! It's kind of funny to see how far people will go to money. \ TIt's funny to see how much a friend can be "whipped". "Beater" enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Kristin. Without Her smooth speaking and deceptive appearance, the film would not be the same. I never use the US to watch, but now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
