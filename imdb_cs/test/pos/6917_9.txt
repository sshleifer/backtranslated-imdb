The original story and funny, convincing characters went well for teenage girls sleeping on the screen (2 times). I loved it, it was fun and moved fast, no boring stretched scenes. He is violent and has a small language (though most of them are covered). It's a great movie. David Strickland was a great actor. Ron Eldard performed amazingly. I always look at girls every time.
