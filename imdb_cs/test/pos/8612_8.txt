It is especially difficult for the director to capture filmmaking without being expensive, inbred, excessively dramatic, or all three. Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive, lizard-method brains of female auteur in extracting from two "cattle" (as Hitchcock called actor) a love-singing intimacy scene. Her main battle is with her leading man ("Actor is Really Woman" she opines), though, naturally, it is the leading lady who steals the show. I don't agree that this is Breillat's first comedy. 'Romance' was cheerful in different places, but I agree that the French sense of humor can be elusive for strangers; In fact, dozens of IMDb reviewers found no romance comedy. On the other hand, Sex Is Comedy raises a lot of laughter, mainly by using the actor's actor to return to Plautus and ancient Greeks for thousands of years. We were thinking of leaving the theater, whether Roxane's "beard" was a wig. Anne Parillaud's wonderful performance as Breillat struggled with her own screenplay and looked ten years younger than her age.
