I don't see why everyone's bombing it. I thought it was a great fun time, which unfortunately wasn't so popular to be so famous. Believe me, I've seen much worse than this. If you want a bad movie to see a blood shack or a stranger dead or something. So what is a normal slasher fare, but better than most. And it's observable. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. Some music is very exciting. And the death scenes are also fine. We see a very bloody body in the bath with the inscription SOLD written in the mirror in the blood, and we also get a cool double spanking toilet plunger! with a razor attached to it! It was a good 80s slasher fun that definitely is worth your time despite what others say about it.
