This is not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, though I have to admit it's still good. Among the things I liked was the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves the most accurate materials) and the incredibly scary seeker (who looks like a skeleton with a thin layer of skin stretching over him). Although the studio cost a lot of money, I didn't care about Doris Day in the movie - it seemed to cry a lot and yell "Que Sera" as a fullback. Yes, I know she was supposed to sing that way, but this made me hate the song. Sorry. Another complaint, though smaller, I had about the movie that it was a little "too polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (also Hitchcock) seemed to be much rougher and brighter - and that added to the scary environment.
