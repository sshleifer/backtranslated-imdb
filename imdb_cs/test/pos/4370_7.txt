Overhead is a wonderful thing. He revived a lot when he first appeared (inspiring famous review "No No Leica"), this predecessor "Cabaret" can now look at comparisons and not half bad. It is certainly no classic, but it has its own praise, (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this chart, while the scenic version has somewhat changed the storyline). One should, of course, resist the temptation to twitch when Christopher Isherwood is from Laurence Harvey (retains the original name of the author; God knows what Isherwood meant), describes himself as a "confirmed young man" and while Harvey is totally inadequate "Hero" (is it practically asexual), and Shelly Winters is woefully mistaken as Fraulien Landauer (part of Marisa Berenson starred in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is absolutely amazing Sally, (he's a beautiful piece of comic book) and Anton Diffring is Fritz, German-Jew love with Shelly's character. Of course, if "Cabaret" never came, you could ask yourself if it would ever see the light of day. That it was revived may not be quite a reason to celebrate, but it's absolutely acceptable all the same.
