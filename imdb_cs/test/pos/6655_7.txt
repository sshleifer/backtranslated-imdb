I went into this film thinking that I wouldn't like it, but I hope I will be surprised, but that, like the movie, ended up bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong, Minghella delivers every bit of a magnificent epic, and for those who enjoy this kind of experience and are willing to accept this adventure and accept what comes in, they won't be disappointed and it will be one of the best films of the year in their opinion . The performances are high quality and most likely to leave with a trio of Oscar Names for the Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's few scenes may be the strongest in the film. The places are beautiful and Minghella has a good view of the good shot. However, for those like me who want the director to take them on an adventure, instead of volunteering, disappointed mainly because of Minghell and his adaptation. The film is so utterly bleak that it does it for what I consider to be an epic punching bag that is a film that struggles to hit emotions hard, but it does so extremely and so often that I didn't have time for emotional investment during the film, or it did not recover from the previous wound, and became unrealistic and, as a result, too difficult to really care for, not to mention predictability. Overall, the "cold mountain" almost left me to return to the good aspects of the film, because I remember the death that might have been the original motive, but ended up instead of the characters.
