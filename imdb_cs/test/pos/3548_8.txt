10 respected directors have made a short film with opera arias as inspiration (and music). I will do each separately: Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). The story of an assassination attempt in 1931 in Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs Wife) Playing Man! It's not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell's great. Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No story, but there is some scary black and white image that fits perfectly into the music. Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horribly. Unimportant, boring, no conspiracy, nothing. Full of gratuitous female nudity. Worst! Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris play in this funny, if obvious, story of a cheating couple. Well. Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, fresh and romantic. Very good. Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Blunt. Yawning. Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This is Bridget Fonda in her film debut. A beautifully finished love story with a relatively explicit sexual scene. Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really special, but OK. Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical view of youth and old age. Very sweet. The last one is Bill Bryden, who does "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!), Dressed like a clown on his lips, synchronizing with Carus (!!!). When it came out, it almost got the X rating (for abundant nudity and sex scene). It was given R with a strict warning attached to say R's rating would be strongly enforced. After the bombing of the film, this warning disappeared. The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments have paid off. It is worth seeing, even if you don't like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give it 8.
