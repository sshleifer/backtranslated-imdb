Absolute classic 80's of haunted flix. This one is not like any other because of the pint-size, wild eyes, psychotic youth with the urge to kill against all adults in the city. Bud of JUST ONE OF GUYS (again 80th gold) plays one of the children-killers and he is paired with one of the little girls Jake Blues they are trying to buy at BLUES BROTHERS. There's a third blond, but for some reason he disappears from the movie. Violence is sometimes cheerful and also surprisingly awful. The demonic group of smiling children, though somehow obsessed with extra-planetary means, little resembles the droid children of the damned, who never thought of using pistols, crossbows and shovels to kill those annoying adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown - second) shows her rack as well as three times when she dances in the bedroom. This film is a rarity that I can't believe I was missing in the 1980s. If I saw it, it would be my favorite movie as a child. Where is the continuation of the end? This movie is just incredible. Look for it at all costs.
