A busy comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as a conscientious physician deeply committed to his research. Once he snorted his experimental formula, he changed to Hyde, which swallowed up the scenery, which did not lead to the end of the problems for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. He has a really crazy, crazy approach; it is full steam ahead with one incredibly stupid but undeniably cheerful joke after another. Funny lines and gags are in abundance; Blankfield plays every role for everything that is worth it. One peak has Hyde bursting into a song; "Hyde's Got Nothing to Hyde" is pretty catchy and I can still hear it in my head. The top even goes so far as to spoof old b & w horror movies. The supportive cast is quite temperamental anyway, with Bess Armstrong as ditzy fiancee Mary, Krista Errickson as Ivy's spunky, and Tim Thomerson as the wonderful colleague of Dr. Knute Lanyon. I wish more could be done with the character of Thomerson because I'm a fan of this man, but it's always nice to see him in something. Camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shaye and George Chakiris in portrait as himself. without saying that if you prefer highbrow, smart comedy, you should avoid it at all costs. But for those who have zany, politically incorrect, cheerful fun, it can only be a trick. <br /> <br /> One of the best bits last saved. <br /> <br /> 8/10
