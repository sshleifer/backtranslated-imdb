You have to be very patient to sit down in a movie that is so flat and unreal that you wonder what the fuss is about when such a seductive audience greeting opened up in the 1940s. <br /> <To some of the weak one-liners and the common gag's look, the plot is as far-attracted as the stories Fox (Red Skelton) tells its radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real solution to commit a perfect crime and get out of it. But then it's such an unrealistic comedy. But if you're a real Red Skelton fan and enjoy the look back at how comedies were made in the 1940s, you can at least enjoy the friendly cast that supports it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray are doing nice as his love interest and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his most fun moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the secrets of wearing turbans. "I never knew," he thinks, overwhelmed by the small point that is cleverly introduced. All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept a lack of credibility and simply accept gags because they are. It is not always easy for the viewer, who is discriminatory, because many of them simply fall flat, so many comedies of this era are happening because the novelty of the gags of the eyes and the one-piece inserts simply wear out.
