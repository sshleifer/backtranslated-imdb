It is a nice story with nice music, lots of dances, lots of interaction with a big sister / nurse (almost everything positive) and many wishes. These are funny moments that older children and adults enjoy, as when King Randolph calls, "They're just SHOES! And gentle moments like Princess Genevieve will please her youngest sister, Lacey, after a mistake. The animation may not be as good as Disney, but it's still very good. Facial expressions are nuances, particularly for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duchess Rowena and her servant, Derek Cobbler and Little Princess Lacey. My only argument about animation is in dance sequences, where dance princesses become absolutely absolute copies without the slightest deviation - even the three youngest copies complete dance moves perfectly. I would like to see a little more individualism in dance, as these girls are not professional ballet dancers or choral dancers. The story resolution is cleverly crafted to get rid of the villagers without actually hurting it. There is some violence made guards in the story, and the villager monkey is for other animals in the story. My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and watched it repeatedly, and I found it quite acceptable to watch it.
