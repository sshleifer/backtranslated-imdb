This show has everything you ever wanted from a prison drama. There are twists and turns all the way up to the season finally. The characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power. When you watch the show, you feel not only prisoners but also prison staff. The actors who play prisoners at this show have done a very good job in which they imprisoned. Also, if you like the law and order of yours or the law and order of criminal intention there are many actors from this show that appear in these shows. The only problem with Oz is that it wasn't long enough. This show could easily have nine to ten seasons without getting older. Even after the season finale, I found myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on TV. Don't be crazy, go watch Oz.
