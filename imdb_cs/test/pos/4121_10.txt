It is at least very close to the perfect video publication. Messianic metal band, dinosaurs rock n 'roll, the biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and remembers the band's past - what more do we need? The video starts from "War pigs" and ends up in "Paranoid" and in the middle of all the biggest and most significant classics of the original line-up are included: "Electric Funeral", "Sweet Leaf", "After Forever" , "Iron man", "kids grave" ... and of course my personal favorite "Into the Void", I'm glad they didn't. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> Still, this video More than just music, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are going through a rich history of the band, the only thing that bothered me a bit is when a live song is interrupted by pieces of conversation. the name, right in the middle - one on the other? I doubt it is still a little mistake, so it's not too big a problem. <br /> <br /> The band members also climb chairs and talk together: a nice material for Saturday fans! I confess I have trouble following this What Ozzy Osbourne is mumbling about, but it's just fun, I had the pleasure of attending when "The Last Supper Final" came to Finland and for me this video is the ideal way to remember this spectacular show.
