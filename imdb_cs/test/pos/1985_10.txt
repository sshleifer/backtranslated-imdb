Let's get started!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as Cronenberg's films, which would usually appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see JJL is one of my favorite actress . She is as beautiful as usual, this cutie! I wouldn't say it was my favorite movie of her. It's still interesting and fun to watch. The rest of the cast is not very impressive, but it is not a kind of erroneous field of stars. ;) <br /> <br /> We recommend with confidence!))))
