It is not a "direct cinema", in fact it is the opposite. The second sequel to Gatlif's Romanesque trilogy, Mich√®le Ray-Gavras, is a film work, not a pure documentary, no fiction. Instead, Gatlif chose various locations of travel from India to Spain, wherever the Roma have a strong presence, and with the help of artistic directors he has listed several music numbers that tell us how Roma live, sing, dance, fight. and survived. The film may have strong opposition to those who question the hypothesis that the tribe of Rom is of Indian origin, mostly questioned by those who see the Nazis directly linked (so in a way, they are not persecuted). o work of great beauty, strong colors and beautiful singing and dancing.
