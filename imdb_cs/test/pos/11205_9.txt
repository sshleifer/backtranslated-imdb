Is it a film about loneliness and how is the distance? physical and emotional - tends to dampen relationships among people. The story is simple to the point of banality: a young man Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in a big city. After trying for weeks to find work without any success, the tension that Yusuf has with him is too much for Mahmut. They are arguing? nothing physical, just verbal. Eventually, Yusuf goes, leaving Mahmut himself again. The End of the Story ... <br /> <br /> Except that the performance of two men as relatives is one of the best on film. Much is said visually; Dialogue is used to provoke disagreement, mistrust, hostility and insecurity that exists within and between the two men. There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, when looking for a job with a young Yusuf who needs a relationship, he tries in vain to get the attention of different young women around the city. A look at his face, as he always gets frustrated, says everything. Or, if you want a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the Mahmut's balcony and lights up in the cool December air, leaving the door open; Mahmut, eventually gets up from his desk, walks to the door (all glasses) and cousins ​​look at each other for too long. Then Mahmut closes the door and leaves Yusuf cold. Metaphor is complete. Or, Mahmut will purify Yusuf, reluctantly and with growing anger; And all the time, Yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously at work, and spends Mahmut's money on a toy for a nephew? Yusuf is emotional, untidy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is a rational, logical, confident and demanding supervisor enthusiast: true brain, left-brain dichotomy, beautifully played by two actors who say more with a look, gesture, frown than any words. But Mahmut is not completely emotionless: he still loves his ex-wife, who tells him he's with Canada in Canada. Mahmut affects the distant and confident friendship with his ex and ensures he is fine to go. She wishes her well. She says goodbye. She leaves the cafe where they talked. Later, when she calls her last farewell, on her way to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly watches her leave. Leaving emotions on your face when they disappear through the door is worth a wait. All in all, this is an excellent work by two major actors and director Nuri. Ceylan. Some might argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes slowly most of the time, especially for those who are alone. Working with the camera is also relatively simple: select a scene, set the camera and lighting, and let the actor move around the scene, enter the scene and exit the scene while keeping the camera. There were several panning shots, some high-angle viewing shots, several rural scenes? but much of the film is shown as though on stage with fixed camera and wide angle lens. With the exception of TV and radio music, there is no music in the story. And there are as many long silences as two men sit and watch TV together and / or engage in very limited conversation. I saw this movie on TV so I was amused when I saw a few times I watched TV watching TV. The silence in the movie matched the silence in my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); When I watched TV, my chairs and positions matched Mahmut's position. Pretty scary, giving me a feeling of 'being there' with him? And I think I was in a sense. <br /> <br /> I will say nothing more because I want you to enjoy the other scenes I have described. It's definitely not a movie for everyone. More than any movie I saw shows how much we die when we all are alone? just as we are all alone when we die. Mahmut's face, as it disappears in the last scene, stays with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie lovers.
