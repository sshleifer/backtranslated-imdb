I saw this movie in Paris. I accidentally went to a bad theater and I was addicted when I realized it wasn't a preview or a short movie. Paulina does a phenomenal job of keeping her attention at acting. I can't say enough as I was impressed that I was her portrait of this real femme fatal. The rest of the cast also plays very well. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the biggest movie I've ever made, but since I didn't know anything about it, I stayed with a lasting and very positive impression. exceptionally! I stopped talking about this movie for 3 weeks after I saw it.
