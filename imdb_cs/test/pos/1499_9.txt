Most of Chaplan's most famous films are his feature elements. And I suppose most people have only a few clips of his pre-war days, when he played in dozens and dozens of comedic shorts. It's really a shame because some beautiful shorts are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie, they have an excellent chance to see some of the better Chaplin shorts. Because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and followed them along with a little narration to make this feature film from 1959. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's earliest films from 1914-1915, his small tramp character is still in his earliest incarnations or is entirely missing. Plus, even though he was there, he was often evil and confident - something very alien from Little Tramp we loved. Second, because the shorts that were selected were in great shape when you watch this movie, you won't have to worry about watching a scratched film with gaps and lousy music that doesn't match the action (common problem). So for a great look at Chaplin's shorts at their best, give this movie a chance. It's sure to provide you with some great laughs.
