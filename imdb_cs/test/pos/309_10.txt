Of all the war movies in Vietnam, it's probably the most frightening and worrying and it really says a lot with so many magnificent ones that came out. She has this crazy feeling about it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie that it scares you. It's not that it shows a lot of different things compared to other Vietnamese war movies. What pushes it to such a high level is: <br /> <br /> The director was magnificent here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic film. Unlike other directors, you feel like you are at war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. But Coppola feels confused, shocked and frightened. Usually we convey these feelings of war from the film or story. This is something I've only experienced a few times while watching a movie. Of course, writing was also amazing. It brought a note to the center of the movie. It never bored me and this movie is three hours. Cinematography goes hand-in-hand with the overhead, which has greatly contributed to the horrifying viewing experience of this film, which shows all the chaos around you, even though everything seems to be calm. The meeting was bone cooling. All you have to do is look at Marlon Brand and also his last great performance, deceived, from Colonel's morning. When I sometimes think of a crazy soldier, I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this movie you don't want to see in his eyes. Just like the movie was crazy. For me, this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen showed a very deep performance and probably the best of his career, so he could see with all his eyes all the madness he was experiencing and still want him to reach his goal. It's just a wonder why these two didn't get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of this madness with his ridiculous battle strategies, among those who play music to tell the enemy he was coming. Also, Duvall's character, asking one of the soldiers to fight in the middle of the battle, was just shocking, but believable. Another great supportive performance was given by young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest, who all summed up the attitudes of many soldiers at that time without becoming clich√©s. Also for once portraits were put into good use with Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, which I both love. Certainly I would recommend people to make this movie. My message and everyone involved in his creation is at best. There is nothing more I could ask of this film about my great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and see why he lives up to his Apocalpyse Now title.
