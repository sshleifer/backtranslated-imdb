"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a great extent through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs her film very visually. For all he wants to find, he finds powerful images that are able to stand up for himself. The film thus understands itself as a medium that tells its stories about images on the screen. Especially European cinema is often very controlled by dialogue (and many young American directors are heavily influenced by it). The opposite attitude of Criales was really the right point that made this film special for me. It also has a very interesting theme that is packed in an unusual story and narrated with humor. Vincenzo Amato is excellent as the family head of Salvatore, as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg, which I enjoy watching in each of her films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just choose one: When a ship leaves Italy and people just stare. This scene is great, especially if you're thinking about pop cultural links that go with it (Titanic!).
