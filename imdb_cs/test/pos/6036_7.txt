My first 'Columbo'. Rather, he enjoyed it. Peter Falco's great format and character is very good ... beautifully unpredictable, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple as well as Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has the following. As a professional musician, I have to say a few things. First, the conductor who only produces these pedestrian performances from the most basic examples of repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...), will never have such a house or fame as this or a car like this, much less called a genius . And the leadership the actor does is so bad that he is ridiculous. No orchestra would take him seriously. There are also a few things, such as his Eine Kleine Nachtmusics (why try it when they played it for TV? Any orchestral musician could play it in his own way as well ...). His instructions to the ensemble are completely nonsensical and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what "quasi fantasy" means, he says it's Latin. He is Italian, as is the vast majority of musical instructions. Finally, no two big musicians would have the following exchange of EVER: "Play something." "What do I play?" "Chopin". Music is their work and passion, they know it well. Something much more specific would be asked and offered! <br /> <br /> I know. I should get out ...
