I play the final fantasy 7 and this movie is like a game, all fans of the final fantasy will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic and history is good, but the best of this movie is visual effects, they are amazing. The characters are equal to the game and these details are good for the fans. <br /> <br /> You don't have to play the game to enjoy this movie, all people can enjoy the movie because history is different and easy to understand. I buy a DVD because it is HIGH, IS 100% SUITABLE if you don't see this movie, what are you waiting for? Believe me, you'll be fascinated like me
