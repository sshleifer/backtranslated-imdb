Since many other users have already explained and commented on this story, I will not do it. But I would like to rephrase that Bardem's interpretation is amazing, as well as the interpretation of the other actors and actresses in this film. Reading Previous Comments I have noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film does not have a point of view against euthanasia and that the little ones are ridiculed. In my honest opinion, this is far from true. There are many characters who move in the gray zone between loving Ramón Sampedro and want him to stay and understand his desire to die. The most obvious of these are the family. For example, Ramon's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Gené (a social rights activist) who at the last minute tells Ramón to reconsider everything. The scene clearly shows he doesn't want him to die. Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Ramón's brother is clearly against him, just like his father ("There is only one thing worse than the death of a son and he has a son who wants to die.") that Ramon is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, no doubt the scene is comical, but that doesn't mean the priest is caricature or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene is based on the fact that the priest is trying to persuade Ramón to continue his life using the arguments of a totally strange Ramo thought. The priest's speech goes to the line "God gives and God takes", "We do not own our own lives, belongs to God" ... and so on. The comedy is based on the fact that Ramón is an atheist and the whole priest tells him that it is nonsense. This film is the opposite of Manichaeism, allowing the viewer to think about the subject and his opinion. And over something else is singing FREEDOM.
