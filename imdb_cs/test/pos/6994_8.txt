Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I wasn't a Vin diesel fan before I saw Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel rose. He did a great job with Riddick, whom the man wanted for many murders. His character is cool and makes many decisions that surprised me, just as at the end Riddick was getting ready for the ship and saving his own buttocks, which he left behind. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is a low budget, but this movie goes to show that you don't need amazing special effects and a lot of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters from this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
