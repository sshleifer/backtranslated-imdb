Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" as perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows this girl is on a good level. When two interlocking eyes on the French market, we know that this match will be full of sparks. As they walk in their garden in a restored French Quarter house and play love, it's a dream for all our romance. Costumes are beautiful; The set decoration wishes you that the "neighborhood" was just this way. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with a wide porch with all the old gems that were chatting. The Edny Ferbers novel is a story of revenge for old wrongs and struggles over who will run the railways of this industry. In the Saratoga scenario, Florence Bates as a big lady steals every scene. But this is Cleo's scene, which was sent to her little attorney New Orleans to buy her, which is Magic Movie Moment. After Cleo brought him to the negotiations, he looks at her with desire and says, "I can say - you are very beautiful". And Cleo says with a happy, malevolent smile "yes, it's not lucky." You want to shout "YES" !!! One of my favorite romantic movies.
