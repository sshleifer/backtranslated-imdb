George Sanders playing the saint for the penultimate time is doing a good job from a good script - with the usual good RKO part around. It's a charter story that is full of murder and good pure fun. Theme 1: In New York, Police Inspector Fernack, Templar's friend is framed in a corruption scandal and contempt - ST comes from London trying to put things right. So far nice and simple - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Thread 2: Another story of a woman who has avenged the people who murdered her brother, Wendy Barrie, is throwing herself on some nasty men who have fallen in love with her. Including Baddie, who was under their direct protection and in Fernack's cellar - there is a haunted shot (dead and staring) and is in the car when they take him back to where they got him. Paul Guilfoyle, as Pearly Gates, must have a gay - a robe witness at the beginning and a charming ST comment later that he was thinking of being a pet - and he did it for Palm Springs! Fernack played Jonathan Hale as usual, but this time with such a defeated deflated stance that what he really needed was a good slap from the Templars to revive him. <br /> <br /> Hays Office has also made sure that you have the right image, all the threads are bound without beetles. It's worth watching all of us who like this kind of thing, but if Val Kilmer's version is your benchmark, don't bother.
