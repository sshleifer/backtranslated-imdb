Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone on the bowl saw it and everyone is saying the same thing. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, also a loud speaker "nice sir, so you left the right indicator on you". Or when Jack goes home and lies on the couch and bursts beer, "dish is hard work", he broke me. And when his roommate is interested in joining the club and calling a bingo number. Jack buys all the raffle tickets to win a meat tray. Bloody big movie if you're into the lawn bowls as you can relate if your no lawn pitcher forget that I think. Evans Head Bowlo would be rated as the best club in Ausu, friendly people, great company.Hi Evans Head Bowlo Steve
