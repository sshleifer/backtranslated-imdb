In my opinion, Dad's army is the best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just look at one episode of a show, you can't completely judge it (this includes the movie) in this episode. When you get to know the show, you'll like it. The film now has several changes in the series, which is slightly disappointing, but still works. Check out the show or two of the show first before you watch. You won't be disappointed. Good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
