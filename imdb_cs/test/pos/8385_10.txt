... "Inglorious" as our local theater decided to exhibit its title on its awning, minus the second word. It's an amazing cinema. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to recommend this movie to everyone but exaggerated. Let them never know what they lack. Because of my experience from previous films in Tarantino, I was reluctant to give her ten stars. In any case, with the exception of "Reservoir Dogs", they improved with further tracking. So even though I gave him ten stars, I reluctantly did it. It leaves me no "up" to go to. Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we all imagined the worst to be. He is sophisticated, sophisticated, courteous and saddest, a man who can make a cup of milk a threat and who suddenly throws a cigarette into a strudel, grinds it into a whipped cream, as if the victim is cutting his heel. <br /> <br /> To understand the Tarantino films, you only have to feel dialogue, color and stimulation. Colors are as clear as necessary and, if necessary, even clearer. In the French farmhouse in the opening scene they are muted and dark, but excessively. Outside, the brilliant sun shines, but in one room in the house everything is bathed in shade and black. It is a brilliant environment for questioning Waltz, as the "Jewish Hunter" of the SS, who is swinging his visiting French farmer over the abyss of revealing what he cannot reveal many times, then pulling him back with obedient lines of friendship and understanding . The second sadistic German, played well by August Diehl, later functions as an important actor in the last conspiracy. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz .... almost. Film courses will study much of this film. They should look lovingly at excellent stimulation. Tarantino knows how long to pull the scene, build tension in the way Hitchcock, then just at the break point, suddenly comes to resolution. For colors, look for the ultimate shot at the French Theater, where his secretly Jewish owner is launching a surprise for the top downhill of the Nazi leadership. We see her playing Melanie Laurent and waiting for hateful German dagatars who come to the film preview of the latest German film, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious achievements. Laurent is framed on the balcony, reflected in glass mirrors of beautiful theater, red lips and low garments. they reflect everywhere the intensity of her proposals to her guests. It's the only film that would be worth the whole movie. Fortunately, there are many other such images, many other scenes with excellent dialogue and tension. <br /> <br /> In short, see. I'm sure you'll see it over and over again.
