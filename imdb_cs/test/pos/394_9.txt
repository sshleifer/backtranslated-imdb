I enjoyed this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love hate relationships, along with scattered action scenes and some light moments when mountain men face tough military discipline. All the main characters are well occupied. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum would probably make the lead as well, but Victor Mature will surely meet the stubborn battle for Tarzan. He reminds me of his film role as Samson, another difficult but not impossible man to restrain. Mountain men in the opening scene are certainly anachronism, because the era of pure mountain shepherd hunters has largely ended 20 years ago, with the collapse of the western beaver population as well as the fashion market for beaver beavers. This story is said to take place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano behind the introductory scene (probably Mt. Lassen), the fictitious fortress was located somewhere in the distant part of Cascades, as we never see any other civilians. But there is a lot of contradictory evidence that it is actually taking place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the war chief who threatens hunters and soldiers in the fort, is named a very famous commander of the Sioux War, which in 1865-66 led a very successful campaign to wipe out the newly built military forts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (East Wyoming) is mentioned as being not too far from a fictional fortress. Assiniboines in the plains say they are joining the Red Cloud. This aspect of the story, then, bears a general resemblance to historical fact. It may be interesting to notice some similarities between this story's plot and that of John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a fortress commander who was recently assigned to his first Native American border post. He underestimates the military prowess of his opponents, who consider them to be little more than cannon feed to support his career. In both films, they pay very precious for their inexperience in fighting the enemy. Likewise, the Greenhorn Commander hates a subordinate who has years of experience with local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. . In both films, we have a promising romantic relationship between a woman very close to the command heart and a subordinate, who the commander does everything to silence. Obviously, the commander must be expelled to allow these romances to continue. I also see some similarities to "The Misfits". Soldiers, as a whole, including the commander, are misfits of any sort ((as one of them owns): mostly they have "problems" or are brutal recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans. , with a husband who is very uncertain about his future in the army, and hunters are also misfits who in fact do not want to accept military or civilian discipline, but to cut off their former free spirit lives according to the recent Red Cloud military antagonism. <br /> < Finally, we can also compare this story to a later film by Anthony Mann "Far Land", starring Jimmy Stewart, and at the end he may decide to go back to being a cowboy himself, but a mature character doesn't come with any new way Be your own boss, and Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this area too much of a burden Besides, his obsession has a wife.
