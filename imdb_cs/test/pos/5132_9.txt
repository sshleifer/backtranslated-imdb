Hoot was amazing. Owls are delightful and the film draws attention to interesting environmental issues that I did not know. Florida is full of so many fun characters and the movie does a great job of putting it on the screen. My children loved various animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. It's a really simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When children are young, it is when they really develop their sense of value, and yes, one of them has to look after our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the movie even caused them a conversation on their way home on animals and how to help them. It was just sweet and persistent when I heard my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the birds. By the way, overall it was a really great time and I would recommend the film to anyone looking for something fun and meaningful.
