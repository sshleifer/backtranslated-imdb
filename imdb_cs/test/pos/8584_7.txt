I think there is some revisionist history going on here, but it certainly comes with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a problem maker who encouraged his people to violence since Congo declared independence. He is unable to control his people and decide to bring Soviet aid, to return his army to the queue, it was probably what the United States had engaged in and led to his assassination. However, when Mobutu replaced him, the United States did not solve anything. Well behaved with excellent cinematography and exciting scores. Certainly worth seeing.
