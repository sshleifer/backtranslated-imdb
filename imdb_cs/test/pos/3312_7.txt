Although this film is dated, it's definitely worth watching. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and changed my life ... I just lived in New York. It has great introductory images from the Manhattan skyline, where Johnny Mathis crocodiles "Romance is Still ... the Best of Everything ..." that rival West Side Story. There is a somewhat ugly performance of the world of REAL's first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry for Janice D.), but it's a great eye-candy! It also offers a little insight into the late 1950s American mores - our obsession (and suppression) sex (in the workplace, not less!), Romance, and marriage before a pound of women. It represents an era in which New York was at its best and Joan Crawford's super-biting performance is just the icing on the cake.
