Being a big fan of horror, especially Asian horror movies, I've seen a lot of movies, but this is great. Why? It has a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). The actors did a good job. It's like a real documentary (though it's not). It's not boring for a moment. The director cleverly combines the storyline with the acts of a certain Japanese magical cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still believable). It reminded me of a similarly great movie "Forbidden Siren". For me, one and the only unpleasant thing about the movie was Hori, the psyche, but that is subjective. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of high quality horror games. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
