This film reminds me of the later film Rock Hudson MAN's FAVORITE SPORT - a fishing writer who NEVER hunted and is forced to enter a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is the writer of Martha Stewart, who cannot cook and actually does not have the perfect family she describes in her articles - in fact she has no family. Like Rock, it is maneuvered into the show - in this case, it creates a huge holiday while on a rural holiday. Since there is no family, he takes a veteran and a few friends home and desperately tried to "leave the cat out of his bag" that he can do nothing of what is known. Cute little comedy and welcome film for the annual holiday movie lineup.
