Another "must have" movie. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds and looks so typical American! And wasn't he great at "The Searchers" as Chief Scar? Another of my favorites, I have it and watch it over and over again. If I could add it to my collection, it would be my day! This is a great wildlife story and a movie for all ages. The scenery is so beautiful, and the fate of endangered snow leopards is told with such great emotions that it will interest everyone at risk, especially children. If I could give a copy to all my grands & great grands!
