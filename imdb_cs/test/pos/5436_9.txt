This film is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is tremendous in his support role as a manager and his commentary will make you laugh. Robin Williams plays a big role as a quick joke "Jon Stewart" and will entertain you if you are a Comedy Central fan. The show is good because if the viewer is half-brainwashed, he will see it as a much needed subcultural attack on the policy of the current Republican government and criticism of the American democratic process ... to mention the means that most politicians choose. I was amused at the sub-grounds and found that the movie is very fast and fun, without any usual "oh-brother" I agree that the film is less comedic than marketed, but no doubt better than 90% of the waste in theaters. Just my thoughts ... Don
