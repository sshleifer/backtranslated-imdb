What to say about "Pink Flamingos"? This is beyond criticism or even explanation because it is not really eager to be like any other movie you have seen. You either take it or you won't laugh or get angry (or both). John Waters is a strange filmmaker (who mentions it slightly), mixing both innocent, childish humor and shocking moments to be ... well, who knows what his intentions are. It's like a form of attack, though funny. The thing that makes Waters' humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit the world, which may seem like strangers, so completely familiar with the viewer. as a tiny rivalry that forms the conspiracy "Pink Flamingos". Surely everybody experienced something like that at some point, but almost certainly what was at stake was not the title of "The Most Vivid Alive". What makes the film convincing for me is the way Waters creates dizzying, self-contained environments and won't let you joke instantly. The people in his films are perfectly consistent. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her to the city because Crackers brings his "girlfriend" out to the trailer, Babs reacts with a conscious smirk and tells her, in the plot side aside, "that little shed is just PERFECT .. "At this moment, we don't know that Crackers is planning to take his" girlfriend "out into the shed to pull her live chickens on her naked body while Cotton watches through the window, but this strangeness of the character in the fictitiously degenerate world Waters creates is Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant chamberlain of the Marbles.When we see them for the first time, Waters strangles the scene in Connie's cozy office on Channing descending into the basement where we see two women, one dead and one very alive and turned off Susan is not a victim who cries but is furious and offensive against Channing, she jumps up to launch a verbal assault on creditors, both of whom have a strange understanding of the bizarre situation, and her kidnapping is not so intimidated that she is violently offended and fairly furious. She doesn't leave for one second while Channing is in her eyes, and the two scenes that represent their delirful joking are two of the comic peaks of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles House and discover their crimes, which held the kidnapped women in their basement, it represents a complete lack of support for God and her family for the mark of corruption that Marbles are pouting. - There is something the Divine Unknown is, and the corruption suggested by her newfound opponent, and despise her. Although the kidnapping does not seem to take anything divine into account twice, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily liberating them and looking forward to the revenge they take on Channing. At the other end of the spectrum dirt, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the "real" world. When we see Connie for the first time, she's downplaying a smaller character named Sandy Sandstone who has never heard of Divinity. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts cheerfully to the factual assessment of the Divine title as the "most vulnerable living man" that reveals that he also inhabits this unspoken and insane world. Something must also be said for the way players are in contact with their respective roles, especially the divine, who does not miss a note. He never disappears in the absurd guise and character given to him, and lasts "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or weirdness. In fact, people believed that divine is such in real life, and it is easy to understand why, because when you watch a movie, you don't really think of a movie, you think about these people who did it. Given that they really do those nasty things in the script, you start to think it's not a story, but a bizarre documentary. But even more so, "Pink Flamingos" is not that much of a movie because it is an event or something that happens to you. Although the shock value is mostly gone for me now (I say mainly because the scene with holes and the scene with the chick still makes me), I still find that this film is cheerful and forming.
