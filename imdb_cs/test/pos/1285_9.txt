He watched it on the DVD three times - once the "normal" way, one with successive scenes (in this noir movie, the beginning, the middle, and the end of the story intertwine) and one with the director's commentary. Pretty amazing. The story of bare bones, narrated with greater taste, energy and substance than most major budgets. I think this is an even better film than the following Memento, which brought me first to Nolan. I can't wait to see what he's doing with a bigger budget (and bigger cash stars) in his next movie, Insomnia.
