I also saw it in the cinema in the 80's and I never forgot it, though I never saw it anywhere. I don't know if I see it now, it seems it's dated, but I remember the story and compare it to some of the horrible modern movies I've seen on Zone Horror. It might well stand up. I still remember that his coffin was pulled out and opened, and all the dead bodies revived, and the blue lightning bolts. When I have seen hundreds of horror movies and still remember this, it must be good.
