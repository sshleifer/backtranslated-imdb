Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen comments on the film that I disagree with more than the comments of the people who did about it. One could learn from critical views of this film. As an educational film, I greatly appreciate it because it teaches how to succeed! We do not follow films that should be taught; generally we watch entertainment. As fun, I rate it low: the end is positive and cerebral / intellectual. The result of this conflict is my eight stars. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), producer of television news. The Network's Executive Director will present Tom Grunnick (William Hurt) to study the position on board the news reports. Tom immediately enchants people with humility. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for its flight opportunity for several years, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news stories, inside and outside. The Network's CEO wants Grunnick to be in the air and Jane says Grunnick isn't ready, he doesn't know the news. They don't listen to her. Jane, who was forced to put Grunnick in the air, contacts Altman to find out about the news story and send Altman's notes over the phone to Grunnick while Grunnick talks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman / Jane Craig's words and Grunnick because Grunnick cleverly translates everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear to make it understandable, enjoyable and entertaining. Altman gets a chance on the air and network managers require him to look for a coach from Grunnick, a new guy. This new ingnorant is coaching him? This is something Altman does not see rightfully, but reluctantly agrees. Grünnick trains Altman and gets excited to notice hundreds of Altman's flaws in appearance, sound and vocabulary. Altman had never considered these things when he became an expert on the news. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him causes Altman to have a panic sweating attack in the air ("Flop Sweat"). Grunnick eventually becomes the top anchor of the net and Altman resigns before being fired. But Grünnick failed in his romance attempt with Jane Craig because she found out from Altman that Grunnick sometimes falsifies circumstances to make people like him. This removes it from him. This sends the message that we want people in relationships that are real and not trying to be like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends a message that getting people to like you is the most important skill at work, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people who comment on how it's dumbing down TV News and how Grunnick presents a good looking but stupid guy or the whole style but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick had the skills and a very complex intellect to get people to like him, including the presence of the mind, to know exactly how he appears and sounds when he is on the camera (he trains Altman to emulate the word in every sentence) . Grünnick's mistake, which cost him a relationship with Jane Craig, is that he's too propelled to be sympathetic and a false situation. Many people call Altman very intelligently or brilliantly. Altman plays Brookes not as smart as Grunnick and "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind couldn't handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when he is in the air. Altman is angry with this fact that he knew that the news and Grunnick had managed to make him happy. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the television news industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in employment is obviously not popular, but my experience shows that this is true in most jobs. This film is like education about how to succeed, fantastic, though unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting end.
