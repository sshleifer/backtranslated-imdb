STUDENT NURSES is not a typical sexploitation film. Sure, nudity and sexual openness are there, but it's not all for laughter. Stephanie Rothman has written a socially compelling, well-written breast and ass that confronts racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, Vietnam war, free love, LSD, and drugs. experimentation. Four sexy college roommates take their nursing internships simultaneously. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to Terminal Care, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to Public Health, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) to Gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to Psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunity to get rid of and commit fornication to benefit the audience. They are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, after all they are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. Visceral but low-budget action sequences are scattered everywhere. There is a very bloody shooting at the Resistance Movement headquarters in which two police officers are shot and killed, along with several members of the group. The (Vietnamese) war protest, which consists of hauntedly dressed young people from all races painted as skeletons, becomes violent, with cops protesting the protesters. The effective sequence of beach excursions consists of beautiful, strange and confusing sensory and memory photomontages with hyper-sensual overtones. In short, the STUDENT NURSES are a thoughtful and convincing reflection of the times expressed by real female perspectives (because it was written and controlled by a woman). But it's still fun and captivating, despite his sober handling of the subject.
