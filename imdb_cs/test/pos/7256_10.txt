Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favorite movie genre (historical action adventure with comedy), which is why I rate it so high. Action centers around the Plunkett and the layman's gentleman who are involved with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all kinds of escapades and adventures that are all tinged with comedy. Of course there is also interest in love. The rest of the cast is made up of a number of live, larger than life characters that contribute to the atmosphere of the film and show redundancy. rich at this time. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie with a fairly simple but useful graph that provides a lot of fun.
