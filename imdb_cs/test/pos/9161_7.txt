The film is basically about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghanistan, before the main soldiers' appearance in 1985. The film accurately portrays the gloomy reality of the Russian army that made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and non-commissioned officers) physically annoying, beating and degrading younger recruits), the mixed nature of war (you can trade your enemy one day and kill it next), women's lives on the front, documentary shots of helicopter attacks and coffins that are sold and shipped home in heave C-130 Hercules class of Russian tracer aircraft to steal Stinger rockets, fatigue, boredom, anti-war mood, emotional party just give. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly executed and often illogical, such as the Major Bandura suicide walk and the back of a 10-year-old boy armed with an AK-47 who just killed. Also, the fact that in the middle of a firefight in a mountain heavy grenade launcher jumps out of nowhere (and every half-clear man knows it's practically impossible to jump 40-50 lns launcher to march someone). At the same time, however, movies show that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes murdered, ruthless destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal, unscrupulous killing of civilians is overlooked as a side damage inevitable during the war ... Some foods for the idea of ​​why it is the Afghan war is lost. It's not the best war movie, but it's so deep and intelligent that it's worth watching.
