I really enjoyed a film wooden camera. I think this is a bit influenced by the Brazilian film "City of God", but perhaps this parallelism between the two tracks that can be seen (crime and art) in the social environment is a reality. I think Madiby's movies are really beautiful. I don't think it's unrealistic to shoot such good movies because there are a lot of artists who have no type of education and can be really brilliant. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It is adapted to images. Watch the movie ... it's good to show how life can be in a social environment.
