One of the best memories of my childhood. It should be on DVD. It captured everything we grew up in the 1970s - peace, tranquility, floral power and great acoustic music. Two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the ultimate peacenic hippies, with long hair, peasant blouse and bell days (looking like Katherine Ross (ala "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story").) <br /> < They made us happy with daisy "chucklepatch" jokes, gave us lessons about having been pleasant with conversations with a squirrel in the garden and entertaining us with the music of their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (Cold). This show should be in a time case from an era that would also include "it is". Yellow Submarine "," Arrow to the Sun ", and Marlo Thomas", "Free to be ... You and Me.", Also "Sunshine" and "The Point". And last, but not least, that the theme of the song, "You see ya, you see, I hope you had a good, good time, aha ha, I'm glad to say good morning" ya, I hope we get to see ya again, see ya, you see, i'm glad you could stay a while, aha ha, i hope to see you again, you see, you see.
