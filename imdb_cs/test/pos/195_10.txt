Unlike many who have sent here, I'm not a film literate. I stumbled across this movie by accident (surfing the canals) and couldn't surf anymore. This is a truly incredible film that is worthy of all the praise of critics and those who are in this place. The actors are amazing. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fianc√© Boris is sweet and patriotic. You can't help but feel Boris's father's irritation and grief as he accuses his son of such foolishness that he voluntarily served in the great war. Others have summarized the film so well, so I'll just mention a few scenes that made me the most. When Boris's brother tells his family that he and his brother have broken trust and "must marry" with Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her resistance to this betrayal (although her part in the infidelity might have been through rape). You're afraid that the rest of the movie might make it wrong by visiting just the destruction of Tatiana and her brother, or worse, showing Tatiana destroyed by the immoral descent into cigarette smoking. Because this is not a "French existential cinema", the latter does not happen. Thank God! Another scene that tears in your heart is when an unnamed "musician" soldier who was rescued by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of his son's death. He unwittingly breaks the message to Tatiana. I can't describe the grief from this scene ... but Tatiana finds out that straw has to be caught and hopes that Boris will return home. The musician has never seen Boris buried, after all. I'm not going to mention more scenes, but I want to notice that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't make any difference to the film. Boris's brother is revealed as a piano playing anti-Soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife will have to be. There is no doubt that at the end of the film he will get at least "tenner"! The end when Tatiana finally learns that Boris is dead is still happy to end and fill the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that had to go through the theater when they survived this war, with their own losses in mind, for the first time they saw this movie. Unbelievable. Go see it.
