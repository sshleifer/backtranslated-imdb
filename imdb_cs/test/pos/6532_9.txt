I know what most people will think about this movie without seeing it ... "A typical movie from a famous singer ... It'll be a pink movie, a teen movie, it'll be stupid ..." and things like this ... And yes , it's ... I think it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world dreamed of something like a 'Popstar' conspiracy ... She met his favorite singer, met him as a man ... and even had a romance with him ... right? ^ ^ I really enjoyed watching that ... Plus it's really funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a great job ... There's a lot of loving characters ... A, Aaron Carter (JD) is no exception ... To be honest, I'll see him act in the first five minutes, I thought it would be awful ... But then I really enjoyed it ... <br /> <br /> I also have to to say that the music performances on the film are GREAT! Especially I loved that part when JD (Aaron) sings without music, (only with guitar) very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will show ... <br /> <br /> My advice for your? ... Watch it! Don't do prejudice ;-)
