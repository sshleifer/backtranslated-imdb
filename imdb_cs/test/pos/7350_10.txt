I love love to love this show. Whatever you say, it's because I'm crazy in the brain or not. I think this show is very fun and entertaining, even if Uncle Bam Vito scares me. And so I really think that if you're in "omg .. what idiot" kind of humor, this show is for you. It's really funny to see the look of jokes and there are many music guests coming to Bam's house. Buy it causes the rocks! You should buy it. Yes. And brother Bam is in the band CKY and they are really good and sometimes come to the show.
