I'm from Germany, so please excuse my writing style. As I saw Chucky 4 for the first time when I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as the usual haunted 80's, but the bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First, it is the work of the very good director Ronny Yu, which we still have in mind from the Chinese ghost story. His visual style is wired in the same way as Francis Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chuck and Tiff are very impressive. I also enjoyed the script, especially the scene in which Tiff throws Champaignbottle in the ceiling mirror. If you have any comments about my opinion, send me an email. MFG Schawez
