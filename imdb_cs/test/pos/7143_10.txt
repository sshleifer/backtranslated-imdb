Easily one of my favorite dramatic TV movies, in many ways beautiful but sad, warmly warm and provocative, it's an excellent dramatization of several years in C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I have found it to be incredibly absorbing in the excellent and "realistic" dialogue and situation. Everything seemed to be "real", but there were "magical" moments that would almost take you in. Ackland and Bloom as central characters were excellent as well as supporting cast. It's one of those dramas that is hard to criticize, simply because there is nothing to criticize for me, it just works so well on many levels. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
