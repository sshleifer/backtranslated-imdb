A young missionary who returns from China for 20 years, refuses to become a CAT-S-PAW for a hometown gang hoodlums. This film was a bit of a departure from Harold Lloyd's previous films. A comedy derived more from dialogue, often somewhat serious, predominates here, rather than elaborate gags that propelled Harold's classic past. There are some wonderful moments, however, to be pure visual entertainment, as when Harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street, or when he desperately tries to hold a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes. There is also a supreme scene, set in the basement of Chinatown, in which Harold cheerfully jumps unbashedly into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor comes from Harold's refusal to be the heel of those criminals who fly his hometown for years. And it's a pretty collection of distorted politicians and criminals Harold finds himself against, starring actors of fine character: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and Stuttering Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is on hand when the girl behind the tobacco grabs Harold's eye and keeps him fascinated by her senseless life. Movie mavens recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary father; Charles Sellon as Elder Spiritual Stockport; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all uncredited. Noah Young, a well-known face from the silent Harold movies, has also appeared for a few seconds as an experimental hijacker, and his final appearance in Lloyd's image appears here. Li≈°ka produced film production of values, especially in the opening scenes in China.
