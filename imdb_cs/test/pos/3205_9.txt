I like this show. She has drama, romance and comedy that are all in one. I'm 28 and I'm a married mother so I can identify both Lorelei and Rory's experience in the show. Most recently, I've been watching mainly repetitions on the Family Channel, so I'm not up to date with what's happening now. I think women would want this show more than men, but I know some men would enjoy it! I really like that it's an hour long and not half an hour, as it seems that the hour is flying when I watch it! Give him a chance if you've never seen a show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters at the show, mainly because they are among themselves. How could you not see something that was there (or so long to see it, I think I should say)? <br /> <br /> Happy watching!
