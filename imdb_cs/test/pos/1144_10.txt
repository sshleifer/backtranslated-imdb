I saw this movie in school and loved it absolutely. On the basis of a real story, it is an absolutely wonderful piece of film. I couldn't really find anything wrong with it. One clear plus is how it was filmed. In 1904, planted in Morrocco, the wind and the lion are filled with mixed images, such as the great Raisuli on horseback. The cinematography was flawless, the cut was sharp, the costumes were beautiful and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention Jerry Goldsmith's music, it was phenomenal. I used this phrase a lot recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie composer for nothing. His score here is so exciting and exciting that he shows the true musical genius of man and this gem of the score should be there with the best Goldsmith score with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. The action is exciting and the scenario is smart and sophisticated. Also, the direction is sensitively processed. The performances were also overwhelming, with Sean Connery, the image of the charism and suavity, magnificent as the Great Raisuli, almost alone controls the whole picture. He is attached to the feisty Candice Bergen, the affectionate John Huston and the captivating Brian Keith in one of his more underrated performances. History is fairly accurate, perhaps weak in some areas, but with the acting, music and visual feelings I have been so good in the past. Bethany Cox
