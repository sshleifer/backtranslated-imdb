Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great news, great symbolism, a very good movie <br /> <br /> It's hard to go wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan together as a three man lead and together with director Edward Dmytryk pulls a complex murder and detective yarn. That's enough reason to watch it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to fully capture the graph as explained (too much) or displayed in the flashback (also too). without a complicated reason. Overall, it makes sense, and we see early (too early) who is the culprit and even why. In addition to the drama, well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short pieces, making post-war films dramatic, there's a social message, an anti-Semitic point of everything. It only borders once or twice with preaching and it is so obviously a good point to look at it happens and wait for the plot and dramatic performance. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is in the sense of a credibly rude and angry manner (Ryan is in it, his rational reason). Mitchum mostly plays a watered-up version of what he is famous about, and the fourth well-known acting power, Gloria Grahame, is great, concise, present, though it is slightly useless. The sequence of events and messages, both of which are in force, is very easy to look at just about lighting, working with the camera and playing, including the classic battle scene that opens the first few seconds of the movie, with shadows. The archetypes of the soldiers presented are very deliberate, and that could be something that people at that time were very familiar with and could be the same as an anti-Semitic thread. The shocked shocked soldier was a helpless (but still capable), modest young man with no confidence (but also capable), and a tired but outwardly capable veteran there. And of course, an angry, violent soldier who is also the result of the war. This last responsibility is also the responsibility of society - even the army goes everywhere to correct injustice here, not just because they are criminals, but because it stems from the weary of a long, terrible war. <br /> <br /> The audience then, more than now, could really get it, but it's there to appreciate yet.
