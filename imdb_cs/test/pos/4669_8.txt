Here's another pleasant surprise. Every time I hear that the film is being reworked, I crouched. Films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Day of the Jackal are reworked and the results are smaller than stellar. So, when I heard that "Italian work" was still overworked, I expected it to be bad. Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally see the movie, and it was proven to be wrong. True, it's not original and predictable, but it's definitely fun. From start to finish, you're on a very fun ride. Minis's scenes are great and the characters are really enjoying it. So even if there are some flaws that care if it's fun? <br /> <br /> A total of 8 out of 10. The only lost points are maybe a few details and a slight lack of realism. But you'll have so much fun that you won't even have a chance to stop and notice.
