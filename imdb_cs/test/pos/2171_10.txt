Most of the participants' responses to this service were very apt, although some considered it slow or ambiguous. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. This is seen as anti-war, due to opening and closing scenes, and the foolishness of the pretended grandeur, how amazing the equestrian men looked, how they were preparing for the great accusation in Eylau, in contrast to his so terrible and disturbing conclusion when we see bloody uniforms, boys dead etc - but most of all I see the film as a moral person in an immoral society. Finally, Chabert chooses a retreat from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and chooses the simple pleasure Derville (who is saved by his recognition of Chabert's basic decency and morality of his choice of renunciation) - white bread, cheese, some wine and tobacco - over wealth she leaves to her wife, and her shame and society. In her case, we see the film as a feminist, in the position of women at the time, in which there are the only weapons that Mrs. Chabert has, her charm, beauty, wiles, and finally money.
