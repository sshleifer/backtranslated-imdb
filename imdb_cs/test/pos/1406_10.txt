Haines is great as a cheeky cadet who thinks West Point will really be something to come. Haines portrays his simple, goofy comic character as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And the amazingly touching character of Haines is too far away and almost avoiding fellow cadets. New, humble Haines took a shameful last minute to play the Navy football game and wins the game despite his broken arm. Great, exciting MGM entertainment in this Haines Formula movie, shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as a skinny follower. A nice-but-goony character would be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is the winner!
