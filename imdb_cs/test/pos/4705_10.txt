I was given a chance to talk to co-creator Rebecca Cammisa at the High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, New York. She said her style was to be completely open and uninhibited in filmmaking, but he was delighted to be so severely restricted in the tight spaces of a group of houses. Narrow corridors and small rooms were professionally shot by realism that would be lost with a more controlled and deliberate camera. Sister Helen is a remarkable figure who comes from a tragedy in her own life and being. unusual combination of care, hard and smart street. The way the film introduces us to its past is excellent, spending just a few carefully selected minutes sprinkled around the world. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't start praising praise for this movie. It is really a treasure trove of cinema and the subject of humanity.
