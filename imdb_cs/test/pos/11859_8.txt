I rented this movie without hearing it (or reading it). What a shame! This film is intelligent, witty, cheerful, quick and realistically ridiculous. Characters can develop without relying too much on clich√©s, tired stereotypes. Watching was refreshing. I couldn't think that marketing would help this non-so-mainstream film lobby in starved mainstreaming. The quality of dialogue and the ease with which actors make great embarrassment, embarrassment, and comedy is so rare these days - I felt that the actors really had to enjoy participating in something like this. How is it that the National Treasure was at number box three weeks in a row - it's too weak in many ways. I think I'm just glad that movies like "Vision ..." are still out there.
