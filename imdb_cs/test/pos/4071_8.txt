If you've seen this movie trailer, you almost know what to expect, because what you see is what you get. And even if you haven't seen previews, it won't be long before you take what you are - specifically, good time and a lot of laughter - from this clever satire "Reality TV" show and "Buddy Cop", "Showtime" directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a LAPD detective who does; but one night in one case, when another police officer, Trey Sellars (Murphy), accidentally intervenes, the TV news crew appears and Mitch loses his coolness, resulting in a lawsuit from a television station that will cost it. separation some big money. Except that they do it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to show her boss on the "Reality" show, that would mean no one other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as the real life of "Dirty Harry." <br /> <br /> Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase a green light. All he has to do is convince Mitch to take part, which shouldn't be too hard, because the station has agreed to refuse the lawsuit if he does. But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he doesn't want anything to do with what it would be - until he has his heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who gives Mitch's future a brief perspective for him. And so is the show on. Yes, there is one more thing; for the show, Mitch will need a partner. And who do you think will come to that? Let's say this: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. This is the second film by Dey's director, his first "Shanghai Noon" - also a comedy-- and He certainly shows a penchant for the genre. From the introductory frames, he creates a pace that keeps the story together and allows his stars to make the most of their talents and personal strength, including perfect timing. Of course, with stars such as De Niro and Murphy, Dey had a leg at the beginning of the project, but he is the one who keeps him on the track, proving he knows what works, and achieving the right combination of physical comedy and action and the use of subtleties dialogue to great effect. There is no more natural actor in the field than De Niro, and he enters Mitch's skin as if he were born. And after years of hard playing, in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another, with such films as "Analyze this," "Meet the Parents" and now this, he firmly based his expertise on also doing comedy. Mitch is not a particularly complex character; in fact, it is something like an "ordinary" guy, but there is a challenge for the actors - to believe him, to be a man who can be your neighbor and just another member of the community. And in all respects De Niro succeeds. It's Mitch, the guy you run into a grocery store or a bank, or say "good morning" on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on television and has life, just like you and me, who becomes his life by being a cop. It's the character Mitch has to do to make this movie work because it makes a "ordinary guy in an extraordinary circumstances" trustworthy. It is one of those roles - and work - that is often wrongly rejected because it looks so easy; And, of course, this is what makes De Niro so special - it makes it look simple, and he does it with the device. Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy becomes a winning achievement, well, and it's a role that suits him as a proverbial glove. Trey is a cop, but also an ambitious actor - and bad - and gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the exaggerated side of his personality (ruled in enough Dey not to keep him) - on top of Jim Carrey) who works perfectly for that character and this movie. From his melodramatic part, which took place during the audition, to his ejection from one-sided lines - released when looking directly into the camera (which, if it concerns him, is not there) when shooting a reality show - Murphy's rebellion. And he has chemistry with De Niro, who really clicks (which is not unexpected because it is another of Niel's many talents, his ability to connect and bring out the best of his stars, everyone - evidence will be support - they are better at their craft then what they worked with, including such as Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few, and most importantly, this is the part that allows Murphy to excel in what she does best, and certainly out of it Russo is also using his role as Chase, which is also a character who is not too artistically drawn but who is beautifully featuring strong, believable performance, and William Shatner (playing alone) absolutely steals a couple the scenes as an exhibition director. <br /> <br /> The support cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man). "Showtime" is well crafted and delivered, it's a comedy that's exactly what it should be: Pure fun that provides a lot of laughter and a nice couple of hours that will giggle for some time. It's the magic of movies. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
