Mickey Mouse, the first fully fully synchronized sound cartoon, debuts on screen in the exceptionally entertaining short film "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a steamer worker under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete, as he would later be named). Mickey boarded his long-time companion Minnie Mouse aboard the train as he tries, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was wildly fun and positively fun. Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising, and Hugh Harman helped Walt create a short film, "Steamboat Willie," basically marking the start of Walt Disney Company's success.
