I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to admit, the only reason I went to see them is I'm a huge Callum fan Keith Rennie. And he didn't let me. He gave good performance rather unsympathetic character and provided a single comic relief throughout the film. The film itself is the usual "lot of bad people trapped in a snowstorm" together with the story, but it had a few twists that argued. The characterization was strong and the whole cast played quite well. The only problems I had with the cast were Rose McGowan. She was so cold during the film that we had no idea about the character or the motivation of her character. In addition to her and some minor continuity problems, it was a well-written, well-functioning thriller.
