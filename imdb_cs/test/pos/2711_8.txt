Karen Carpenter Story, where the two carpenters are in the recording studio, is a clever little scene, and Richard decided that Karen was singing for the studio owner. Richard chooses the Wrong Key for Karen to sing so Karen sings over her natural areas. You see a bemusement on the owner's face; shows that he really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in another key. Another thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner has an invaluable double. Hezky uděláno! For some reason, I've never forgotten about the scene. The story of Karen Carpenter Story records the meteoric rise of carpenters and the struggle of Karen to overcome anorexia. Many things are overlooked. This is not a documentary and the film left me with many questions. There is very little mention of the Karen solo (the CD was released just a few years ago. If you buy it, you'll be wondering why they were waiting. It's one of Karen's best works. in my opinion it was a great recording. <br /> <br /> I hear you say you can listen to cheap, time-worn little radio in the middle of the Third World, it would seem to produce more static than anything else. a carpentry song appears on the radio, you think you are listening to a Hi-Fidelity unit worth $ 1,000. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
