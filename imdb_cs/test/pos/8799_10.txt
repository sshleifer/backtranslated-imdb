Human traffic is undoubtedly the most original and strange movie I've ever seen. He documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people bored with their daily existence and dead jobs and rave ecstasy on the weekend. It is cheerfully funny and extremely engaging and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as 'Trainspotting' it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising British stars. The film was made on a small budget and I look forward to the future offerings of writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his filmmakers discovered his talent.
