I stumbled on this movie while I turned channels on the teevee one night. Twenty years later I was still interested because it is an important lesson in life that teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And while it tells the true story that takes place in World War II, it's amazing to look at the nasty things happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought of "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today, it has something to do with race or ethnicity, after reading this story you will think differently. I think I was pretty naive when I thought evil follows the prescribed set of rules. Evil is so bad he does. This film teaches a valuable lesson and I recommend it especially to church groups or civil rights organizations. I do not expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I would really like to see it again because there is one amazing scene that gives them a totally unintentional but interesting look at the banal complexity "racial expertise ". In this scene, the protaganist, who was captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, was "discovered" by the SS and brought himself into the room. There two play a kind of guessing game where an SS officer is able to determine where our hero (Anthony Quinn) comes from - and where his ancestors came from. Well, "come to know" that Quinn's character is not, after all, a member of the "lower" race, but the perfect artypical Arya! Which does not mean for Quinn a character who is more interested in talking about cities, rivers and mountain ranges that have just been said to be the SS. Among other things, he gets his job in a slave labor factory where he wears striped rags and works to model slaves where he wears tailor-made Nazi uniforms. Yeah, it's definitely a better show for a guy who always appreciated wearing nice clothes ... until the Allied armies came up and recognized his face from magazine covers. <br /> <br />
