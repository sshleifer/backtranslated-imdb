I saw this movie on Sunday night and I have to say that there is no better way to end this weekend. I am absolutely satisfied with the humor and warm charm that this film offers. She just leaves me in a beautiful mood. Watching this movie means having a great time and feeling warm. The film offers sharp black British humor and is very fresh for me. You really like the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so great. I don't know exactly why. She's too old to be nice to me and too young to be my mother. But I really feel good when she appears in the movie. Some may say that the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There just must be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are the characters stereotypes or cutouts? I don't know - I don't care better! I loved them and enjoyed watching them. Furthermore, I have to say that I usually don't like romantic comedies. But this is excellent: black comedy with the heart of gold !!
