I enjoyed this movie very well when it was first released and I saw it every time. Political drama is effective, if not particularly new or inspired. Decades since the film's release, they have shown that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public security is not just something that the screenwriter will introduce. But I think the most impressive element of this movie is the movie's performance of Jack Lemmon. It's absolutely amazing to watch him at work. He has a gift to communicate so many times, sometimes without words. The next time you watch this movie, look at Jack's face when he doesn't say anything. He doesn't have to talk (or worse yet to make a mug) to tell you what's going on in his mind. I call it a spoiler because I impressed it when I first saw the film: in Lemmon's last movie scene, when she was lying on the floor, she felt a slight vibration. The horror in his eyes is one of the most scary images I've seen in every movie. It is a perfect deal, because it immediately raises the threat to emerge - if Jack's character is so frightened, there is definitely something terrible about what happens. And he does it.
