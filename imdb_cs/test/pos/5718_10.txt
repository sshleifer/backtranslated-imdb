It was a very energetic and well-played show. I saw it back in 98 and my friends and I still joke about it. Every time I watch, it's always funny first. I also love the way everyone can apply it in their own way. I am very much looking forward to other scripts and staging of John. Unfortunately I can't find anywhere for sale, and I've done quite a lot of looking. If someone knows a website or store to refer me, I would greatly appreciate it because I'm looking for another live show. Please send me a message if any of you have information on this subject. Thank you.
