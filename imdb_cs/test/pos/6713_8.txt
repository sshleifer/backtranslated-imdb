Tobe Hooper (fresh mainstream success with "Poltergeist") focuses on the sky this time. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson 'The Space Vampires'. "Alien's Dan O 'Bannon and Don Jakoby" was a bit different, I was told: the futuristic story became a contemporary one and Hailey's comet joined in to coincide with his real Earth passage a few weeks after the movies were released (so I read). The story relates to a shuttle mission (commander Steve Railsback) who was sent to investigate Hailey's comet passing the Earth. Everything goes without hitch, but when the comet is reached, it is discovered that there is a hidden alien ship in the comet coma. The team explores a massive structure and discovers dried-out bats. Looking deeper into the ship, there is a chamber that contains three humanoids (two naked men and one rather charming nude lady) in strange wagons. The crew returns to ship with the humanoids and bats in turn. A little later the ship will return to Earth, but NASA cannot make contact and another shuttle is launched to determine the mission status. Docking with Churchill reveals that a massive fire seemingly killed the crew and all flight data. But three humanoids remain. It is known, however, that an escape subway was launched but whose place of residence is unknown. Soon they will make a discovery of foreign origin when her sleeping area creates a very attractive space for a vampire queen to seduce life easily. from the men around her. If you look at it with your face, you like it and if you don't feed after two hours, you will dry up and become dust. The purpose of these three is to release enough of the population's essence to power and keep them and their ship to the next planet to fall away. Fortunately, the commander survives the re-entry into the pod (the crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic reference to her royal glow, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen when she and the survivors the male bleeding attempt from London is drying out of souls. Tobe Hooper ("The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", 1974) does a remarkable job in what is still his greatest production. Production has combined many fine technicians from across the film industry. Designer John Graysmark (fresh from The Bounty (1984)) uses every bit of the four stages at Elsree Studios to create spacious spaceships and the like. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to sci-fi after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive episodes of James Bond. Hume uses every bit of a wide frame with great effects. Oscar innovator John Dykstra, the innovator of the pioneering effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977), will be able to re-create the envelope to create very creative and impressive effects with lasers. Heck i maestro Henry Mancini drops make the movie a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid touch an adventurous feel. In the game department, this is largely on the shoulders of Steve Railsback and rookie Mathilda May (queen of vampires). Railsback always brings the advantage to the characters it plays and can play nuts like no one. This comes into hand when his mind deteriorates when the queen holds herself more firmly on her soul. A beautiful French actress can have a hell of a lot of lines (there were more than ten?), But her often naked presence never gets old and you have to give her a kudos to make her jingle bells. Almost the whole queen is to feed and to seduce you with her sexual presence. Work done and where do I register to become a victim? I really liked how they tweaked the old vampire clich√©s and still managed to make them look fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is counted here: bats (their true form resembles a big bat), coffins (stasis fields like these), transformations (scanning your mind and anything), massive sexual attraction (Miss May. Duh) not to mention that they even include an old backup bet-over-heart (this time a little lead dagger into the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they didn't touch was religion, but I think vampires who use the cathedral at the end as a home base may be just a little blink and nod. In short (yeah right 800 words later 'Lifeforce' is an excellent sci-fi and horror combination that pays tribute to the vampire theme while adding some elegant different wrinkles. The effects and scale of production are sufficient to make summer film types (at least at that time) and horror and sci-fi fans, 4 out of 5.
