Hal Hartley was compared to the modern day by William Shakespeare, based on the fact that he gets his actor to deliver their lines in the iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to make a cast, and Martin Donovan is sensational while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his part with an unforgettable intensity. Although the film is only 1 hour, the timeframe works beautifully and keeps viewers on the fast-track race to the very end. Undoubtedly, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors who have come out of America in the past 20 years, with a vision that is unique, fun and warm.
