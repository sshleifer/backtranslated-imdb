Ali G works brilliantly within the comedy show, but as a movie he doesn't work the same way. Don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of scathing, funny dialogue that carries modern British chav wonderfully well while providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story. One problem with this movie is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it's embarrassing to watch. When I say embarrassing, I don't mean funny embarrassing la Office or Extras, but you'd rather not include it in the final cut. One example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the movie has finished, to tune, "This is how we do it." T Whenever I watch a movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end, and leave it to it. Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie, worth watching several times. The script is fun to some extent and there are no problems with acting. However, the keyword is more specific here. Ali G is a better TV program. Borat is a better film.
