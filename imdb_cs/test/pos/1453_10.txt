This is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies, and that's one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and Elmer Bernstein's musical score is dynamite. From the opening titles (from Saul Bass) to the hysteria of Frank's addict, who will be a cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With Kim Novak (very good performance), Eleanor Parker (which is a very bad performance), as well as Darren McGavin as a reptile gun and Arnold Stang as Frank's stallion. Watch out for bad prints: this movie is in the public domain, so some copies are pretty rough.
