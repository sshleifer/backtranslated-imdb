I loved this movie! He has a big heart and big bones. I came across it by accident and I had no memory, not even a clue, of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth. I remember many years ago reading a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having to contaminate them with a preliminary review of the reviews or a fake whisper. And it seems to be the single most common source of critics' negative reaction to the film: it has not met the expectation that it is a comedy or a piece of life, or a character. I wasn't expecting the film, so it was comedy - but I just laughed once or twice - without comedy; it was about a man, but so eccentric that it wasn't a piece of life; it was about character, but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting his instinct to live that it was not a sentimental melodrama driven by Angst so typical of an American 'serious' movie - as I wrote that I realized that writer / director Lisa Krueger was she managed to bite the fun of the American sentiment in her husband! And very smart! And Kreuger was able to keep the clonally sentimental end of the screen when he returned, not wasteful, with a tail-tailed husband that contracted between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, bravo! (Now I'm going to watch this movie again because it's getting better and better when I think about it.) Graham's performance as Joline is great. I loved how she was gently but completely capable of portraying and expressing intelligent awareness of her binding commitment to her words and actions - knowing she was preparing to taunt her and / or disappointment in a world that was unable to honor the commitment as it did. But even with such force, she was fully associated with humanity and accepted with her fully devoted heart her fragility and failures. Joline's character was incredibly good and I left the movie in surprise for not remembering the prizes. Okay, not so surprised, because American awards tend to go to women in "serious" roles, filled with anxiety and the right amount of nudity that this film didn't have. What it was was much better, which was the heart of discovering this woman with the help of new friends and a self-disgusting shaman. I admit that I am a bit of a gentle touch for the eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and faithful to themselves when moving in a minefield that includes "right" social behavior and "acceptable" interpersonalism diskurz. So if people have to adapt to normality in your world, then this movie will not be yours. It seems to be one of the common topics in the critics. And I am always crazy to play good words when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. I did not make an emotional connection to this film (committing (to things or honesty or something) and committing (to insane asylum proceedings). At what point is the determination to personal feelings of truth and action in life a one-way ticket to madness? That sounds like a simple question or a question that can be easily rejected as rhetoric. But it is? Yet few critics - I think maybe two, commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
