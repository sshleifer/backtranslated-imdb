William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy, or history. Some of his most memorable - and most frequently read - creations provide us with humorous humor, gentle poetry, and a cheerful slapstick. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of impressive depth and gravity. Regardless, he was able to write with unrivaled skill and ingenuity, which contributed significantly to our young language. So in what category is the Merchant from Venice? I was very surprised to find it one of Shakespeare's comedies. I never read it before, nor did I see it, but after watching this latest movie version, I decided it wasn't both. This is one of the many questions the viewer has to try to answer when he copes with what is obviously confused and deeply disturbing to the moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players are introduced quickly and easily. One of them is Venice first; Director Michael Radford filmed Venetian scenes in a real city and created an impressively vibrant, lively backdrop for game management. This scenery is entered by a youthful Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) returning to Venice to see a lovely old friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons). Poor Bassanio seems to have heard of a princess whose father has died and left any potential lottery suitors. Waiting at the Fair Women's Island Estate are three small tribes, only one of them contains "Princess Pictures". One who can guess the right one, using only blind intuition and the mysterious teasers written on them, will give the father a tremendous wealth for life. And his daughter and her eternal love in marriage I forgot to mention. Shakespeare's light comedy takes over the film. This farcical element plot story and also fills much of the movie's screen time as the number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island, humorously competing for and failing to earn this very rich marriage hand. But before this happens, Bassanio, who is largely lacking in finance, asks Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the lengthy journey he must have to pay for his price. Antonio, who is almost worthless, must reluctantly accept humility by seeking financial help from Shylock (Al Pacino), one of the countless Jewish usurers who keep the slack economy afloat, but are not scorned and persecuted into end. most of the city's zealous Christianity. So they live in the company is underbelly, and here's two borrowers have to go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind both men of an incident where Antonio has insulted him and insulted him in the city market, and proudly reprimands this man who is frankly saying that there are a lot of nerves who are asking for help. But help him Shylock. He even clears any interest in the loan, most likely has no reason to worry that Antonio will be able to repay him within three months. One of Shylock's contractual requirements is the pound of Anti's body if they give up their agreement. It is certainly a disturbing demand for Antonio and Bassania and for us. However, despite his justifiable pride, Shylock does not seem to assume that such a horrible act would appear. So here were the dramatic foundations. And while the film sets out to explore its finer side with lottery love and faulty identities, there is still a dark prospect of the loan itself. What will eventually happen to this sinister agreement? Meanwhile, we are turned to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has enough dramatic weight to wear it, and does so with compelling sand and passion. There are times when he is given the space for the theatrics we expected from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those where he internalizes this energy, indicating a contradictory personality: sincere, sincere and proud, yet tense, vindictive and utterly ruthless. This is one of Pacina's most successful performances so far. And while the rest of the cast play their roles gratefully and convincingly, it's Pacino who really owns the film - especially at the end when Shakespeare develops this seemingly romantic comedy with the onslaught of the Third Act. I will not reveal much here; All I can say is that it is an initial loan - the powerful shoe you expect would sooner or later fall. And in general. By the end, Shakespeare has raised a number of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unsolvable questions of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown before us into the final scenes, and while for curtains the dramatic position may be clear to someone. they are completely contradictory. There are winners and losers in this, but do the winners have earned their prey with good reason or have they in the greater sense ended up also losing? Was the reward rewarded, or was it just crying? Was justice actually this time? By the end of the game, some fates are painfully clear and unambiguously closed. But viewers should be the ones who decide on the verdict for all involved. And for some of them, the verdict is still playing. Comedy or tragedy? The author cleverly covered the intense final of the courtroom with the end of light cheer and romantic decisions. He says everything is fine and it's his final, ironic condemnation? The game of humor is used to put us in such a heavy collision. And while this is also unfortunately held by the Merchant of Venice in reaching so many Shakespeare's other works, he is still engaging, entertaining and provocative.
