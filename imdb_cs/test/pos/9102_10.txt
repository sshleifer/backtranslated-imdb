I loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass definitely brought thunder in this epic fairy tale of friendship, hard rock and fate. Filled to the brim with unnecessary swearing in every sentence, toilet humor and a general rule of violation, this film needs to be seen for hard-headed D fans of the world. We follow the journey of the young Jables (Jack black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) trying to regain destiny, win an open night and become the biggest band on the planet. The duo must overcome obstacles, such as a room full of lasers, a man with one foot and a devil to accomplish his task. I'll let you see if they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is amazing and now we see D personally, making the experience even more magical. Must see for anyone who is called a tough D fan. Watch out for the inner jokes from the first album!
