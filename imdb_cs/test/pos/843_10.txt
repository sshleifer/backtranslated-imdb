I've been looking forward to releasing this DVD (and its sequel {Prisoner Scorpion: # 701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I really enjoyed the first two films of this series. After I just watched this movie, I must say it's probably my favorite of the three. All three of these films were directed by Shunya Ito. Very much of them, even though they all have the same leading character (beautifully playing Meiko Kaji), each of them differs significantly from the others. The First Movie (Female Prisoner # 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical film Women in Prison. But the character of the Scorpion is very interesting - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many Western spaghetti. And the director often used very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour. It's not so much a WIP movie because most of the movie has Scorpion and six other runaway prisoners on the lama. This film (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. It takes place as a much more criminal drama. Our heroine is on the run again. But this time she managed to keep a certain amount of normality in her life (as well). He gets a job, finds a place to live, makes a friend outside. But of course, everything has to dissolve. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straightforward story that is told at a quieter pace than its predecessors. But I found it from beginning to end. And don't worry: there is still a lot of corruption in this movie! However, I think that these films transcend most of the movies that are exploited because the more intrusive elements are played in a more direct tone rather than being used exclusively for face shock values. Yes, there were definitely moments in this film when I was crouching powerfully. But I didn't feel that it would make the story worthwhile (well, maybe time or two). One thing that I have been very fond of from these films is the ongoing building of the Scorpion myth. With this input, character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We will see that it is much more than just stone vengeance! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned in this review, there was a fourth film. It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had another director. Without giving up, I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way that the sequel is completely useless. The fourth film is still pretty good, but it seems to play as a redundant footnote to a wonderful trilogy. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in regular movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a separate piece (as well as the first two movies), but I also recommend watching the first one if you haven't already.
