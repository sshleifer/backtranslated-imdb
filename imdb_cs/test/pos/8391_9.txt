While I totally agree with the bottom below about Mary McCormack as she unpacked a milk bag on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was professively great and taught celebrities ins and outs. Foley is a nut but a good way. You never know what brings humor with you. When it comes to the game, it's fun, full of funny joking, and great for any newcomer that can even have an interest in the game. Too bad it's not: (I just checked the plan all the way until August and it doesn't seem to be planned in the future. Bad Bravo!
