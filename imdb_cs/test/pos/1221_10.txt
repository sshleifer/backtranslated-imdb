This movie was great, Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both downloaded it. Tasha Smith was as fun as a cousin, and she couldn't stay out of business. The essence held her for her girl when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and she played my dear grandmother, which my grandmother really reminded me of. And I can't forget the stripper, so it was, and I didn't know if I had my eyes covered up or smiling when I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen. he was fine! Tangi looked flawless and sexy, and she rose from Felicity. Throughout the film he had a lot of "A" list of actors and actress. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie needs to be seen! Go to DVD if you don't!
