It would be great if the discussion of this medium-length film was initiated by a short story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood people. In 1988, this Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. The killing depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than the killing that was made in his Hollywood movies with him as a powerful action star. He talked about an innocent taxi driver whose face was brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's film by a ruthless psychopath who hit him Cruelly with a big stone. There should be no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. That's why Chuck Norris's statement appears to be a cruel joke that prevents violent means in a society that becomes increasingly uneasy. An honest reviewer wouldn't make a mistake by stating that Kieslowski's movie "Decalogue: Decalogue, Piec (# 1,5)" has universal connotations. the events described in Decalogue 5 can happen in any part of the world. The best lesson Kielowski gives us concerns the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. That is why the brutal killing of an innocent driver can cause us to feel uncomfortable in appearing in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damm who seem too artificial. The spell can only be toddlers, but it does not make sense for serious film enthusiasts. Kieslowski also fights for the helplessness of human beings in saving people from the clutches of death and misery. This is particularly interesting because it has been shown over and over again that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent killing.
