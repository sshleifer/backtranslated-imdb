If you haven't seen it before, you should really do it on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It's incredibly realistic and believable. It is true that most of them are speculated, and I would like to know more about what has been speculative and what the proven facts were (not many), but everything handles the theme of "Cruel Mother Nature". It will remind you of the natural programs you have seen on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel, the only animals here are dinosaurs. It works naturally; they eat, kill, friends, play and fight for survival. In fact, you find yourself rooting for some of them and against others. <br /> <br /> The effects are largely excellent. Sometimes they will look a bit too much like CGI, but then you will see them at a different angle that makes them more realistic. In some cases you will actually believe that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorite ones were Coelophysis, predators, diplodocus, iguanadoni, allosaur and arctic bipods. I was most disappointed with T-Rex, but it looked a bit computer-generated. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and very fun. For what it is, its A!
