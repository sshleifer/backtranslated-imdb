This is a great late night movie! What I mean is that I really enjoyed playing my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have $ 6.99 DVD Copy!) Many nights right before bed or when I have insomnia. There is just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated views. It might be fun that Basil Rathbone wears several disguises in "The Secret Weapon" that fool the bad guys and Holmes's assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson) but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, code cracking, and WW II. It could be a light touch that the director uses to address the threatening situations in which Holmes found himself, while keeping the story moving. No matter what it is, "Secret Weapon" is simply an enjoyable and fun detective story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis were looking for world domination and doing it with a friendship bonus between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and the noble themes of "saving the world" of this movie or not (I think they're right!), I'll find that they just add the taste and fun of this great old adventure movie that can take repeated tours. I rate it a nice 83/100 points.
