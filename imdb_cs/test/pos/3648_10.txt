People who say that some of the Looney Tunes cartoon show is unsuitable for children, apparently forgot something: they were not originally meant for kids. They were produced for cinema, are shown before feature films, and so they could show something they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." It has bad puddy tat Sylvester find tweets aboard the ocean liner and board the ship to try to get him. But two things work against Sylvester: Grandma vehemently protects the canary and Sylvester easily gets into the sea (we don't see him throwing, but with his green face it's clear that he is doing it!). And then, of course, the seemingly cute Tweety has a bad-ass streak. It's just great to see how these cartoons were not afraid to go out; no matter what they imagined, they showed. We have to understand that cartoons have not always been considered fun entertainment for children. Really fun.
