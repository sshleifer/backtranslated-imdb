Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (susan sarandon) gives a wonderful performance like Helen Perjean's sister, who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who is accused of murder and who also dies of an injection ... 120 minutes of pleased acting and moving scenes is what you get. Great gaming and it's a movie that gives you something to think about! Susan Sarandon deserves an 1995 Oscar Best Actress. It's probably one of her biggest movies ever. I haven't seen 'The Craddle will Rock', but I have to see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go and see .....
