I would like to know if "Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD? There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and it should go a total of three or even four series. The young German actor in the series was also in the German TV series "Black Forest Clinic", which aired here in the UK with an English dialogue overlaid on the lips. I look forward to any comments from the TV industry staff on the above issues, thank you in advance.
