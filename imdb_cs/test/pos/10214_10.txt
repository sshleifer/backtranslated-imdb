Featuring some amazing and wonderful characters, new mythology, superbly designed and made sets, Nightbreed is a great movie. Unfortunately, the lack of a well-known leading actor makes the film find unclear. Perhaps the director's homosexuality also leads the film to be unwittingly censored by a white audience who rejects the film. Still, the film is a treasure trove of the monster / superhero genre. Continuing featuring Highlander style flashbacks to different eras in history would be interesting. Another idea would be to set up a new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or the Lousiana swamp with crocodiles and a circus of passengers.
