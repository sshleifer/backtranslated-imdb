Donna Reed (as Donna Stone) could do everything. Organize sleep between children or neighbors, take care of her hard-working pipe-smoking pediatrician husband, Alex, and still have a pile of pancakes, three kinds of breakfast meat, and a tall glass of milk and OJ ready for babies every morning before breakfast. Over the past fifty years, we have lost sight of an idealistic home at home, family meals at the kitchen table, and dinner preparation for a hard-working husband when he returns from work. <br /> <br /> I wish the show was available on DVD- I'd completely cut off the cable!
