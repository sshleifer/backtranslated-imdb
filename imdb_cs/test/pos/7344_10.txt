Now maybe it has something to do with the fact that I saw this movie in a little place in my life when I really tried to find out where I was going and what I needed to be happy, but this movie really spoke to me. Jane is every woman: although she has so many positive things for her, she's still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she has been deceived by having reached her potential by accident and living a second choice in her life. He is looking for new challenges and happiness and desperately trying to fill a hole in his heart. Dreya Weber is an excellent Jane. On the way with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair, and ultimately the power of her conviction. Beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and beneficial to production. Allison Mackie is a scenic scene as a spectator with perfect timing. I highly recommend this movie; Although it is a low budget, it has great budget writing and production value. PS- great aerial scene with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and characters, but there is something for men. :)
