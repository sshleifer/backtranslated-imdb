First, at the time I wrote this comment, I have already read what kittiwake-1 wrote about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I would choose a good Denir movie or a video game myself. But what are you talking about? Now that I'm out of the way, let's go on, right? Customizing the Crouching Tiger video game, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name. What is strange is that it was released three years after the release of the film. Whether it's because of a slow development or just plain laziness, no one knows. At least, I don't. <br /> <br /> The game allows players to play as the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for a separate game.) All four of these characters they have fighting styles based on how they fought in the film. However, the real eye candy is the escape movements that allow each character to avoid striking the enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity-defying ways that were first introduced in the film. The story is, of course, based on the story told in the film. The story in the game is narrated using CG movies and spoken in the subtitled Mandarin language (a nice little touch, considering that I preferred a film track in a foreign language in a movie called dubbed). to other characters during the movie and even (No real surprise, because almost all video game adaptations did it) changes what has officially happened in the movie to have more action. I never thought Jade Fox would go so far as to actually go goons. The real story bonus is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to cure Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen didn't return her ridge? What if Li-Mu-Bi didn't get into the green fate a second time? Your actions will determine the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. Yet, for all its strength, it also showscases some flaws. Enemies often tend to become harassed after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed at the most unpleasant places. Even the special features (which are unlocked after the defeat of the game) are good enough to even forgive the difficulties that are forced upon the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. Of course you could just have chosen Deniro.
