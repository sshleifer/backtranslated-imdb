I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was amazing, she is funny and very trustworthy in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to look at too! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual, was pleased to watch that she did a great job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is fun, interesting and can be watched by the whole family. It's hard to find nice healthy movies. Thank God for Hallmark movies, they're amazing! I wish I could buy it if someone knows where I can buy this movie, please let me know! I bought several Hallmark movies and I am very pleased with them. I hope I can buy this one!
