A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the images and effects are such that they are one of those types of films that should actually be seen on the film, screened. Pixelation created by digital transmission sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. However, since this movie is largely unavailable in any format, I assume you will have to do what you can. Anyway, this most beautiful artistic effort comes with the kind permission of a guy who would eventually give us Shadow of the Vampire. It is a dark and filthy film genesis element (if I can collect the characters' names) with a terrifying and unreal process. Begotten is a very good example of what is known as abjective art, a stylistic approach that searches for meaning through visceral more than thematic. And visceral describes it. There's not much going on in the movie, but the level of emotion it gives you is countless. The very repeatability of some images creates a charming catch over the senses. Sound editing and especially scores are spotless and serve the images incredibly well. Fans of this film would have a good time on collections of short films published through DVDs of other films, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Films like these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror rests more in abstract, abstract and non-narrative than in the ghost stories of ghosts and ax killers. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
