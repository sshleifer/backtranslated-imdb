Hi; I would just like to say how much I enjoyed your review and commentary on this excellent movie 'intruder in the dust'. I believe the points you have made have been bright, intelligent and absolutely valid. it is also a pity that this film is hardly displayed on television these days and that it is not available on DVD region 2 - I live in England. Once again, many times for your review. Actor Juano Hernandez was in another brilliant movie, 'Young Man with a Horn', who also played Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. it was a very evocative and stylish movie with excellent music. I wish someone with influence could release full back catalogs of movies like "Johnny Belinda", "I Remember Mom" ​​and "Yearbook" on DVD Region 2, we love these movies in the UK. I'm not retirement age, I'm still reasonably young and my family and I love classic movies !! Such films have been so beautifully made and bring wonderful memories. anyway...! Many thanks for your comments!
