Youth in us is the perfect jewel. I saw this stunning short this year's Sundance Festival. The story took me on a deeply changing path. Directed by Joshua Leonard, acting by Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, artistic direction, cinematography, score - each element was faithful to bones. One can only hope that this great and unbearable film is a prelude to more work from this talented director. Just as a short film is shown before the show at Sundance, commercial movie theaters used a similar format times. It would be great if miniature masterpieces like Youth in Us could reach a wider audience this way.
