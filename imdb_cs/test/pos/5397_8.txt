He enjoyed this film, which deals with a completely average family, so it seems. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in one son who has excellent swimming and wins many trophies, but he hates him very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his second son, Tim (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter Penny (Michelle Williams), who is lucky to be in college. Mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and her husband also ignores her completely. A very tragic event takes place in a family that changes the personality of each, young and old begins to use drugs, smokes a kettle and still drinks at the party. There is even a gay scene and at the same time there is room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
