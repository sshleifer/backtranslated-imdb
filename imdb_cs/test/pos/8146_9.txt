When I was told about this movie, I wasn't very happy to see it, although it was concluded that it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> a movie that is quite graphic (male-male scene, you don't see everything) wouldn't be a gay themed movie if it wasn't there ... and contains some very funny parts. I highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters over you really feel for the main character, and I think it brings the whole movie together. <br /> <br /> Once again, very nice together .. plus cute Mormon.
