William Shakespeare is a merchant of Venetian portraits of the 16th century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who conspires to revenge on a Catholic who looked down at him. The film is a slowly moving plot at the beginning, which is being built over two plus hours. The film gives a very good and faithful look to its characters, especially Pacino. When you hear that Pacino is playing a Jew, he may think that it won't work by looking at the previous movie roles of Pacina. However, it works very well, it must be given to the costume designer and the film director. The appearance of all characters fits well with the time period in which the game takes place. Costumes look like a renaissance look that one can imagine. The film shows a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last one shows how Catholics are trying to use Jews in every way, even to keep them locked up in ghettos and not allow them normal jobs. Compared to the Passion of Christ, another recent film that people have considered to be very anti-Semitic is the merchant of Venice's passion as a Jewish holiday. The film shows how Jews or at least Shylock wanted revenge for the ill-treatment that Jews received. Local shots also seem very topical and the scenery is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the movie, so it is much more realistic. Showing beautiful and ugly can also be considered anti-Semitic, because ugly is usually seen around Jews and beautiful around Catholics. Although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura of some part add a little humor to the act. Oh, such a serious process between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds some humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the process and decide who will be the winner and the loser. This in itself may not be funny, but when we see that they are women who have been disguised as disguises as men, it could be quite amusing. The whole dressing scene, as impressive as it might be, could be even more remarkable if artists and director Michael Radford noticed that both women still look like women and can be easily recognized. The director also saw that women speak their regular voice instead of trying to sound like men, which partly takes the scene away, but doesn't kill it completely. Overall, the film gets 7 out of 10
