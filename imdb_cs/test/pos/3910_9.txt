I have heard a lot of opinions about this movie and then I found out that Paris Hilton is also in it, it doesn't give me the best impression of the movie. From my friends and sitting there waiting for a pile of pants I was shocked that I was scared stiff all the way through the movie ... it was predictable yes, but to build death and the whole movie atmosphere did it Really scary for me ... I watched through my fingers whole journey. So I say go look at it and decide for myself, and if the fact that his scary movie doesn't convince you to watch it, then has Chad Michael Murray in what can't be wrong watching a few hours eh?
