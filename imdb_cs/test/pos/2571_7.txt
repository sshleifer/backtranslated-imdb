In "Black Snake Moan," writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me feels like refusing the whole movie to be spectacular - a charming southern parable with some oh-so risky theme. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is drawn into the image - again it is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film is increasingly blunting its edge until all the production is done with the artificial quality of the play (and I admit that the last 15 minutes go too far into "Happy Ending" for my imagination). And not to mention the archival footage of Son House musician, who is arguing about love and death (and of course what comes). But these peculiarities are also strange in the characteristics of "Black Snake Moan", the story of Lazarus' aging (Samuel L. Jackson), recently released by his wife (for his brother, no less) who comes close to nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, easily giving the hottest display of a basket trailer to celluloid ever); Nursing a girl back to health, chains her to his radiator to overcome her demons, and hopefully redeem her own fallen self. While there is some prurient attraction while watching Ricci fall out of her modest outfit, her performance is risky and mature - there is no footprint in the middle of Addams to be found, and she easily holds her own with Jackson, who embodies the "blues" in her portrait of the faulty , God-fearing man. While the heavy hand, the scene where Lazarus sings Rae's song in the middle of a lightning storm / blackout is convincing, as is the scene inside the jumping blues club that you wish there was. The setting is strong and may be the case for literal symbolism (chain, cooler, strange blurry man who haunts Rae's libido), a deliberate growing up of superstition and spirituality. And it is the belief that this spirituality plays, which lends "Black Snake Moan" much of its power - the performances of Jackson and Ricci make this film a film that goes from sharp to uplifting, well, smooth grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a conspirator of conspiracy I could do without, neither he nor the sledgehammer delicacy can keep it from being a fascinating meditative film.
