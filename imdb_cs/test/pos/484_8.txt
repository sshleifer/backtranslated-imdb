I really like this particular production of "Mikado." Producers added a few touches throughout making it more enjoyable for a modern audience - for example, "How Any Day It Can Become" ("Little List" song) is completely updated, and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the entire play. Freedom was also taken with the setting. Costumes are not Japanese but rather 1920 English (although some of the "Tittipudlian" girls wear '20s-inspired kimonos'). This production is well choreographic with some twenties dance styles, and there are some extra dance maids and bellhops to make your eyes (as well as ears) entertain during songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes can bother you, but I think they're fine - and I love costumes! Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely cheerful; all her scenes make me laugh aloud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entry - the dance bells bother her with the opposite, so she plunges to the top of her voice, "STOP IT !!"! ") I especially like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. You must remember that this is a production that is being filmed, and There is no change in settings, although the filmmakers used some thirties to add interest, and if there is one draw, the makeup is not adapted for camera shots. visible and there seems to be an excess of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere I saw something like that happen earlier with game movies and it's a bit uncomfortable. enjoy "Mikado" for what it is worth - a thorough interpretation of the classic!
