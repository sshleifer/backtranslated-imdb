I wasn't sure what to expect from "driving lessons" - uncertain whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but I was completely addicted in the first few minutes. Music, gaming and scenery were amazing. As always, Julie Walters has done an outstanding performance as an eccentric old actress, Evie, and Rupert Grint, just as well, has given a fantastic performance as romantic Ben. Right from the start, I was forced into involuntary horrors, laughter and swelling of joy when Ben emerged from his control mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably somewhat exaggerated, but still one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend anyone looking for a good British movie and coming back in the evening. just have fun.
