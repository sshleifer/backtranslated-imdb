I think Shane Black is one of the greatest writers of all time! He gave us an amazing (at that time) deadly weapon, shot Mel Gibson on a super star. Then he followed the second best film ever, Bruce Willis in (The Last Boyscout). He struggled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but he redeemed it with The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, it has it all ... Action, comedy, excitement, then it tops with more action, comedy and excitement. Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Don't miss it! 9/10
