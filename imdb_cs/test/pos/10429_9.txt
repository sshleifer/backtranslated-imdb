I do not understand why more people have not commented on it, except that it may not have been much. It's an amazing cast of characters, one after another, everything the person who wrote the game did. If you don't like shooting games, maybe you don't like it (after all, games usually don't look good on TV), but it's a show of one person who will watch you. Highly recommended.
