When I unexpectedly rented a Thousand Acres, I thought I was in the fun story of King Lear and of course it was Michelle Pfeiffer, so what could go wrong? But I quickly realized that this story is about a thousand other things except Acres. I started crying and couldn't stop long after the movie was over. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderful and compassionate movie! Thank you for casting for getting involved and portraying characters with such depth and subtlety! I knew Angry's sister; sister Runaway and sister in Denial. I knew the abused husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh Father ... everything was great. I also met myself and this film was a loop, a relief, a chance to face my own truth and finally to do something about it. I really hope Thousands of acres have the same effect on some of the others. Because I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about nurses fighting on the ground, not everyone fought others - I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if a man had not survived a similar story, he could easily escape the overwhelming undercurrent of fear and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that would pass through it. This is exactly why people generally overlook the truth about their neighbors, for example. But another reason why this movie is so perfect! I don't give a rat's ass (sorry Frenchman) to what extent King Lear's story follows. All I know is that I can honestly say: this film has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep a good job of guys, you can CAN and DO make a difference. <br /> <br />
