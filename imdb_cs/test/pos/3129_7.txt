Although I liked this western, I have to say that it is not one of my favorite John Ford Westerns. For me, it just lacks a certain thing that most of his other films (I have seen anyway) have) I thread you sure, What is something that is not something that is tangible. Given the story is about the Mormon wagon, which is used by a group of outlaws as a hiding place from posse.Ford employs many of its regular here. and excitement. It all adds up to an observable experience. 7/10
