Aren't they going to make these movies anymore? although some may say it's a good thing. Although this was among Disney's first PG rated movies, it has more G movies feeling their studio turned out in? The 70s (ie "Freaky Friday," "The World's Biggest Athlete") than PG Films that came out in the early 1980s (ie "Watcher in the Woods", "Tron", "Something Like That Bad"). Because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" apparently had a large budget. Huge cast and ton of different places are going to show it. But the neglect, the madcap banner hunter and the spectacular visual style were not enough to save the movie from a huge flop ... Failure at the box office, most of us were introduced to the HBO movie at the beginning? 80s, back in the days when the same movies will be shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait? They still do!). Basically, HBO did for this film what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz"? have created an enormous iconic audience for a sweet mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes him a "bad" movie is that there are too many characters and very few of them are embodied . ven ?? Eddie Deezen's "team" has no names! The blue team, even if they are villains, is the most persistent and has the most work embedded in their characters (except for a girl who can't act and doesn't have enough to do it). Perfectly playing the handle of Stephen Furst, Harold is the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. Another stand is that Melio, playing with a lot of magic, now director Andy Tennant. Though then-Dr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be a star, his character often comes out of trouble, especially when he stood up against his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. While everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves a movie could disagree that Furst and Fox are just two characters you really know about. Despite the many shortcomings of the film and the bad actors (most of them dropped out of the Earth after the film) because the actors seemed to enjoy themselves - and the entertainment on the scene equals the on-screen entertainment. Come on, how come the dormitory doesn't dare in the beer basin, and what a zoftig girl hates to steal a show on a local disk ... er ... I think it would be in rave. .. Camps, squeaky-net fun for anyone who was young in the 70s and 80s, it's just fit that it finally got a massive video release that they deserve. But where is the widescreen DVD release with commentary, trailer and full version of the song that plays at the disco?
