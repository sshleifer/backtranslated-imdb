I loved this movie. You can't buy it, rent it, or find it ... but it's a breeder. Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrara .... <br /> <br /> Amazing continuous action and reaction ... loved her. I've been watching my pirate copy maybe six times in the last decade ... every time I show it to someone who has never heard of <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it. So many movies are on the TV over and over again - without any joke and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't know it was for television. .. my copy is 8 songs that I am a pirate years ago ... I hope it lasts.
