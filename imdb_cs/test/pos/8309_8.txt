CONTEXT is everything when a person intends to rate a film. When evaluating this movie, you need to consider the time it was taken. We didn't even know what was inside the COUNTRY at the time, so you can't get too tied up (based on an older book). For the era it was first-class special effects and the quality of production was great. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. For the time of makeup and effects, almost boys in rubber suits look credible as a monster. It is a pure film cheese with bad rubber suits, models and haunted costumes. AMAZING. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
