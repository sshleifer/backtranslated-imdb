Saltmen_ is a long film for his genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than expected by Western viewers. As I said, I really liked it, both in terms of interesting subject matter and the beautiful images that this film contains. Some scenery is really breathtaking and there is enough interest that most should be able to survive the Saltmen with minimal use of fast forward. <br /> <br />
