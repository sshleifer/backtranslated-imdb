Established in 1861, the West was involved in the creation of Western Union's first transcontinental wireless lines. While handsome guy Dean Jagger (a lot of hair) did his best to do it, he was a bad guy who just expected to cancel it for his own selfish reasons. It's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. This is certainly one of the better forties of the 1940s I have seen, and that almost collected 8 - that was so good. However, for my life, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film. His strength was drama - and I think this film is a kind of drama - just set in the old West. Strange, yes, but it seemed good, but I wonder how this great German director felt this work. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it's exceptional - with vivid colors, great filming locations and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott gave another relaxed and realistic performance. But I was surprised when Robert Young appeared in the film, but it was a good decision about casting - he was to be an educated Harvard in Eastern Europe. When I saw that Barton MacLane was also in the movie, I was pretty much supposed to be "baddie" and my thoughts were well-founded because he broke out of his career! As far as the script is concerned, it seemed quite common, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped - so this movie ends at a very high level.
