This movie is hard to find a gem! It is the story of Juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in a large corporate office of the yogurt company, and Romuald, president of the same president. He won't notice her, he won't notice anyone until several conspiracies pull his company away from him and they all hit. He is lost, no one turns and no one believes when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning woman, no one pays her any attention, so they say and do what's in it that she's smart enough to help her and help her helpless and unhappy boss. The complications are wild, not as common with the five children of five different former husbands who are still madly in love with her, and not as smart as she thinks she is. This movie doesn't follow a predictable journey, and that's what follows you. Acting is excellent and some very moving moments are on the way. The working class shows more wit than those above them, almost as much as "Gosford Park" has shown that the upper crust is not all that is cracked to be mentally. I recommend this movie too. You see it! 9/10
