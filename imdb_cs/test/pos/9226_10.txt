Here's what you need to remember about this movie .... It's a CHILD FILM !!!!! I don't know about you, but I'm 80 years old. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So of course I love this movie. But if you look at other Rainbow Brite movies, this is by far the best. But, as I said, it's a children's film. You have to consider it as a children's film. It doesn't matter kids if acting, animation or script is fantastic or even good. The only thing that matters is what happens to the characters. If the good man (or girl) wins, then it's a great movie. If not, then it's bad. You all know what I mean. You were all the children once.
