Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing to prepare its soul for it. Yes, he has a soul and at the same time solves the strictest topic, both with a wise smile and with respect. Brillantly cast and amazing character development, somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation in the cinema verite style. The storyline showed richer than I expected, and the basic themes are teasing quite deeply like every human being "Class B" is brought through the crisis into perspective. A film study of a sociologist's dream, resonating the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love, and lack of it is a lack of attention / love and its manifestation in adulthood, desperate need to belong. Something for everyone here ... almost disguised as questions of untouchables and their separate environments, but of course they are universal. The film works on several levels. The ironic loop is such that the environment that was rendered exists only because of the voyeur that accidentally watches the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights does not reflect its subject and characters, rarity. He deserves every distinction she has made and others.
