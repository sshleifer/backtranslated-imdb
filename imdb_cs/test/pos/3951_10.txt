He gets into the minds and feelings of anyone who drives them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and angular layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own personality, parallel to the inner geography of the three characters, as their stories unfold. Strong emptiness of lost love, fear of the unknown and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this devastation. Three false souls struggle to find something absolute and positive in all those negative spaces. The drama is convincing. James Franco and his teammates perform skillfully. A naive schoolboy, a suicidal blonde, an angry car thief - all converging with unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of broken love - one who unwittingly conspires to get among the most severe forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human emotions.
