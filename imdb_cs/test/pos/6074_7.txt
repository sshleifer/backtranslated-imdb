An English patient is one of those films that deserves all the highest praise. I say, most, because this film, though very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers from some disadvantages. First of all, why, why are modern films so long? It takes more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to focus and watch an extremely serious plot. I say that if the film was one hour shorter, it would only serve well. But we have what we have. Winner of several Oscars, English patient is still very good. It is a deep, sharp treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a great actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is a mysterious man, ready for everything to save his lover's life. It's great even if half the time is a cripple cripple. It's the strongest connection. As usual Juliette Binoche is very convincing and sweet. It adds a lot with her excellent play and love story story with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, everyone is immense and all very strong. And then there is the desert of Egypt, then there is a deep cloudless sky, a green grove of Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, ground mines explode. Also here is the war. It's obvious, horrible and bloody. Then there are corpses, terrible bloody bodies, then naked bodies, adultery and everything. I do not know what to say. So much of the wonderful acting, so much realism, so much brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. Do you think so.
