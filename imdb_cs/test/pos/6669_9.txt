Finally, a film that manages the likelihood of foreign visits with appropriate depth and loving heat. Just in case we are not alone, I believe these visitors are too touristy to take care of us, or to give this unbelievable bank of anthropocentric slave stable evidence of their existence. We will not interfere in the battle rites of some upset desert tribe unless we are on the road with our travel insurance, huh? anyway, the film depicts a transient katarii of a tired mind and a body superior. It happens quite inexplicable and rather unrecognized, but here we are dealing with the film, right? So prot's hospitalization is just a trigger for conspiracy. Jeff Bridges works great as usual, but spacious is cheerful. his role seems to be tailor-made, convincing and lovingly "insane". Eating paddy bananas, sitting in a tree, giving your doctor hard times with speed, wisdom and (most of all!) stunning quotes. I've been thinking and philosophizing for hours. It's an encouraging movie, at least, and Edward Shearmur's soundtrack is just beautiful. Go and get a copy. Catch a beam of light. Now.
