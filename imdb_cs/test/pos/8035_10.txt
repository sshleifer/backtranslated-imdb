This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's an action, but not this bullet-flying, good guys - bad guys, van damme - patholite action, but fast, realistic and nervous action, it has a plot, the cause to the very end of the movie, you don't know how this ends, my characters, Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley are just perfect and tense, this film won't let you go before you see the end. Although there are only a few characters, I did not find it difficult to ignore the story, and as far as the story is concerned, it is basic (not too clancy-difficult but simple and raw) and realistic. . <br /> <br /> If you're with a good story movie, some action and great acting, watch it and I promise you you won't leave until you see the end. The very end.
