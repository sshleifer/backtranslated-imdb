Right, here we go, you probably read in previous reviews on this movie that it's horrible, badly done, avoid at all costs. Well I assume that in some ways this is true, it is fair to say that you could not write a spoiler in this comment because there is no conspiracy to spoil. However, there is a fine line between plain horrible and totally cheerful and believe me that this movie is the other one. The deal is so bad that the plot so non-existent and the end so completely confused that it will make you laugh all the way. There are scenes in this movie that take comedy to a new level. Don't wait for an Oscar, but trust me for the small price you pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
