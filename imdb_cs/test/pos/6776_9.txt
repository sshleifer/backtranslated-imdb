This is by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is a completely original and beautiful land. It's not boring or too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but they don't take it from the story. The fact that he is not in English is most likely the last touch. The end will fill you as I have never experienced in a movie before. <br /> <br /> I wish I found this movie before. <br /> <br /> More rows. <br /> <br /> more lines. <br /> <br /> more lines a lot more lines, done
