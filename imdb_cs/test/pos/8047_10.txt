Some of the reviewers have foolishly judged this stupid film according to today's standards of political correctness. "The Battle" was an excellent movie for several reasons, which was correctly recorded by more rational reviewers: great cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photos. His stars were actually D.W. Griffith Joint Stock Company and this silent movie fan, it's pretty inspiring to watch and enjoy. I've seen it many years ago and I've just been watching it on YouTube; it was a very poor print, but in conjunction with my memory of good print in the real theater, I can rightly recommend it to reasonable people and film historians.
