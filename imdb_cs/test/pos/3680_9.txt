This movie is the most moving and witty movie I've seen in a very long time. As a housewife and a fan (Rupert), I found it nice. Anyone who misunderstood Dirk's angry blast is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know but is perfect, the whole cast is ideal for their roles. Julie Andrews was in my stitch. I follow her after reading Rupert's auto-biography so her inclusion was even more fun. This is sometimes an awful move. I'm not really a fan of the type of music in the movie, but you'll get into romance and find that you sing songs for days. The scene includes Dirk and Gun and his pants, watch it and see!
