One night at McCool's is one of those movies that start with a terrible amount of promises, but as the movie goes on, it becomes stupid and loses that big time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by boasting her body to every man she meets, all of whom fall under her spell. comedy farce. Michael Douglas, who plays the killer, is as good as Liv Tyler, though he seems to have put a little weight on the armaggedon. It's okay, but it's just unforgettable for the scene in which Liv Tyler washes her car, you'll know what I mean when you see it. Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (only).
