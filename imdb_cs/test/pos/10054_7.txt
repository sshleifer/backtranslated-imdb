Nicole Finn (Madonna) is just released from prison. Although she is ordered to take a bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stick around where she was arrested. This is because he claims to have information to help her remove her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is assigned to his future father's right to accompany her to the bus in the future. Louden will ride the city anyway (in his future mother's role as Rolls Royce), pick up a wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. However, Nicki begins the subsequent chaos as he jumps into Rolls to take control. Between big cats, taxi drivers, men affected, bridesmaids, and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer Louden knows he's not in Kansas anymore. Is there a way out of madness? This movie is a wild trip down comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunneare blend perfectly with each other, so their connection is relentless because they play their roles as ex-con, or talkative lawyer. The scenario is laudable in that it is able to send the viewer into hysterical bouts because one unlikely scene is retreating to the next and more. Everything secondary, from supportive actors to costumes to the costumes, is also pretty nice. If you know someone who needs joy of joy, rent this movie for them. You'll both cheerio pronto.
