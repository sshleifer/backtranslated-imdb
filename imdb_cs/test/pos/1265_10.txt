I am impressed that Memento (which is a great movie) is so well regarded in the Top 250 and this does not even appear !! What the hell? To be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the wonderful end, I came to the conclusion that they were equal in their perfection. I'm just confused why it's not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I'm going to argue that (unfortunately) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly) that characters have British accents ... unfortunately because that's not why you don't appreciate a great movie like this. I tell you that if you loved Memento, you will love the following. Brilliant!
