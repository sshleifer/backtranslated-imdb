Isabelle Huppert portrayed a talented piano teacher who is public, hostile and distant in public and bitter towards her students. She privately goes through violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverse. She lives with a mother who admires her and who obsessively drives her to notice (and thus continue in her life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of mother and daughter is "obsession." These characters can no longer change their impulses before the rabbit caught in the spotlights can avoid death. The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who has been attracting her from the beginning. The relationship starts in the most unusual way, but from the outset it makes the perverse and violent conditions it has to perform on it, making it want to end the relationship before it really started. The film is related to women's leadership. Isabelle Huppert is astonished by the brutal, absolutely convincing performance as a piano teacher. She skillfully shows a woman who is attracted to beauty and reversal, but her violence is fed by perverted impulses. As a character-driven movie, you know it won't work half if it behaves badly. This is powerful, intelligent and intelligently and sensitively adapted to the novel. The camera also suits the movie. We can only think that I could call, frame the shots where the director holds the scene and makes the eye go about it. This is done very efficiently against empty bathroom walls, and is another testament to the director's mastery. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and disgusted with this film. But be brave - let go and see it. It is a very private insight into the life of one person, but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense. There are no car chases in this movie!
