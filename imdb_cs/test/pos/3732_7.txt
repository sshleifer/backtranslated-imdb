WTF !! Does any of his books / films end with a happy ending? The laptop was good ... but the boss, with enough depressive ending. I am told that he writes about the realistic situations that people encounter in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it is nice to see people who have sacrificed their entire lives to get into the average unfortunate time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and be able to live it for the rest of their days. Don't we know what's really going on in real life? We cannot - for a moment (an hour and a half) live through a film that ends in a happy note - that gives us hope for our own future ??? Jo - wah. I know. But in fact, I think we need to preface films that end up with a warning. "Attention: No happy ending."
