This show was really good in many ways, though certainly atypical western with a hero (?) Riding a motorcycle rather than a horse, due to a 1914 setting, very "late" for the West, which tend to be set between 1866 and 1890. any disputes over his cancellation at the time but not really watched during his time on NBC. When I saw it and loved it, it was ten years later when I was in an army stationed in Germany and it was every week from the beginning on the armed forces television. Until then, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I always think of her as Nichols' friend. In many ways Nichols was like Maverick; both were more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they fought. This was in a small TV magazine that they distributed in PX (not actually an authorized "TV Guide" but to be as close as possible without getting into copyright issues), which I first learned about the true story behind annulment. I really wonder what would be the next season with more violent twins if they really did it as planned. Of course, at the time this show was made, the "Western era" of television had been in decline for about ten years; One day I hope to be able to write that the "era of reality" has long been in decline! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" were still running, they were both coming to their ends and it was the years when the new West really caught on; I think this trend has done a lot to get "Nichols" back, and it was the main reason NBC leadership doubted ever finding a large audience. But for me, good west, unlike the show at the moment, is somewhat timeless, as are other "period" shows; changing fashion and the like does nothing to look like "dated" than it should be, and I think watching this show, 10 years after making it, is really what brought me to that point. Also, this show is an early pairing of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is really one of all-time great sidekicks, and not only in the Westerns.
