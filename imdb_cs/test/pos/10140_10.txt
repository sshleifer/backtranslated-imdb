This film reminded me of the fifties' live dramas - not like the recent "Failsafe", which looked more like a sensation than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaged and provocative. Anne Heche is more than trustworthy because an army officer who has an affair with her supervisor was played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is amazing when her lawyer defends her against military equipment. I found myself waiting for things to start if they seem to look so good. This film is probably based on a true story, and it is a relief to be asked to reflect on real questions for change. Director: Christopher Menaul, who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and Prime Suspect, is a film with greed and a style worth seeing.
