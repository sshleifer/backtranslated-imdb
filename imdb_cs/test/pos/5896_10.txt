One of the Greatest Things About the Best Years of Our Lives, Although it dates back more firmly after the Second World War, the questions they are talking about today are just as real as on VE or VJ on 1945. as old as the written history of our planet. And although we often do not learn from history, we can be grateful that once the United States of America has done what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing on the best years of our lives was perhaps the greatest piece of social legislation of the last century. So many veterans have used it just like veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell that you see here. All three of these actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the US could identify. They all meet on a military transport plane flying to the home town of all of them, Boone City, Iowa. War is a great leveler of class and honors. March employee, jerking Andrews and Russell High School football star would probably never meet in real life in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and warfare indestructible bonds that can never be broken. March is the oldest man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. They settle in first and best. He has several beautiful scenes when he returns and a drunken drunk, later with a little alcohol, tells the bank officials at the banquet in uncertain terms. I also like his scene where another returning veteran, a capitalist wants to get a bank loan for his own land. Look at March's expressions as he listens to the human tone for money. You feel he reads his soul. This is what made him his second best actor Oscar for this movie. Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both hands while serving in the Pacific. For his performance, Oscar received special recognition. Because of it it was probably unfair to appoint him to the category Supporting Actor, which he also won in. Dana Andrews is the only three officer, a bomber in the Army Air Corps. Perhaps a group of them should stay. He also comes from the poorest background of the band and was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. The uniform and the monthly income checks are what Virginia Mayo was interested in marrying. The problem is that he is much less in the eyes than a civilian. While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochrane, Andrews is very fortunate to be interested in the March daughter Teresa Wright. They are the main story of the film, Andrews adapted to civilian life and adapted to the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran problems were solved with GI Bill. Myrna Loy is little appreciated for the best years of our lives. I think it's because her role as a wife was too similar to the stereotypical roles of the wife she patented with MGM. Still as a wife in March and Wright's mother is really a glue that holds the family together. The best years of our lives won the Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director William Wyler and a few others. others except the two acting Oscars got it. It was a critical and popular success, perhaps the best film by Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It will remain a cute and persistent classic and will be for centuries. It's almost three hours in length, but your interest will never wane once. The best honor this film received was Frank Capra, who had his own film in several categories in Oscar films. In his memories, he said he was disappointed that he was skunked at the Oscars in that year, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler created a masterpiece that deserved every prize he could get. Capra hoped it was an amazing life. Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.
