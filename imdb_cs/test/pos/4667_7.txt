Italian work requires daylight and requires no experience. This is a great matina and a good afternoon in the movies. The storyline is good, but the real playing of the land is very simple and requires no thought process. It's car chase, blasts and all for the simple purpose of defeating the "bad guy" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, it seems he is content to portray exactly the same characters as in his previous films such as "Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you saw the trailer, then you saw the movie. If you are looking for fun at cheap prices then you need The Italian Job.
