(the mood description of the movie can be considered a spoiler - because it isn't really much action) <br /> <br /> Great ... <br /> <br /> Is it a special interest for dystopia and utopia? It's for the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there still some magic? If so, it is definitely the best human ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (depending on taste). I can imagine that most people who hate to watch slow movies (and those from Tsai Ming Liang (who I didn't like at other times) are one of the slowest ones I know). Yes, people are not able to slow down and pass through time - and look at it without feeling that they are losing it. One can take this piece as torture or as a therapy ... <br /> <br /> Surface Theme? Lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - next to each other - but not together? People are tired, something and cannot describe it - they simply do not want to meet, touch, talk, confront others ... as if they have disappeared. The big apartment building looks empty and the rain falls still evokes a strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it must be something unusual, unexpected, some unwanted decline like a hole in the concrete floor - allowing us to reach each other. One of the possible ways to look at it is: Don't explore the inner world of characters - consider the whole movie space to be yours. And ask - why is she there? Where could these depressive states and moods emerge? Is there a place for them, they have no right to be here? And look for answers (if you need them) between the walls and the halls of the block - instead of having a hard-to-transparent human mind. The key to understanding is not understanding - to let the film borrow us - as a subject of study - inside yourself - and at the end, safely return us to our more diverse and "normal" reality. Then you may arrive - like me - a sense of real, possible, unethical hope that we are still human in the core ... and this state of mind can help us a lot to live in this world.
