Pleasant movie that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, sexual harassment in the workplace, adultery and fashion. It's all. Typical signs found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is usually a long-time manager who feels she has to be such because she's with big boys. Hope Lange is an ambitious employee who has decided to get to the top using his mind and not her body. Their personal life is a subplot. The movie wardrobe is great, but someone forgot to tell hairdresser Stephen Boyd that "the little dab will do ya!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair is distracting at times. The relationship of his character with the character of Lange was never fully developed, which I disappointed. Overall, the film is pleasant. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
