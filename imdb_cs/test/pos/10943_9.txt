Do I think that too many events have ended? Don't you think so? There was a romance, an adventure that just like told me to 9 on this movie but the action site was too long. I liked Reeve a little. I didn't understand why she had to die. I thought one of the girls would die too, but my luck! No one else I didn't like! What about you? What did you like? I saw the movie twice. And then I bought it. It was worth it! Who liked the best (man)? The book was really, really, really cool. And also actresses and actors. Everything was perfect ....... What was the title of the song? Anyone also answer my questions ... Please, please?
