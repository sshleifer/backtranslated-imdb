I became a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so now I'm a little bit biased, but I think this movie is great, though it may be several lengths. This is a romantic, non-romantic view of Great Liberation in the late 1960s, stylistically brilliantly polished (great stage design!) And in my opinion, still very attentive. Basically it is an ironic replay of the story of Adam and Eve, who are driven out of paradise after having tasted the "forbidden fruit" that turned from an apple to a hypodermium filled with a female hero who is tempted to use and it accelerates its destiny. The boy seems to be doomed, and has to devote himself to an intense life and an early grave right from the great succession of titles where there is no hope. Although the story is rather sad, I was captured. The beauty of both the beautiful Ibiza site and Mimsy Farmer, I found that her character was somewhat shallow, mysterious, cute, annoying, interesting and boring, somehow what men see in women in a basic, unofficial way. generally are very put from use ??? , which seems to be a trademark of Schroeder. There is even some humor, especially Stefan, the German main character and his accent. His main nemesis is not a serpent, but an older German dubious reputation? and a heroine provider - called Wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan is German, he claims to be an English language and sneaks on his girlfriend at regular intervals in jealousy? becoming a boy who cries ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn cellery. At that time the boy was going snorkeling and then shamelessly climbing the rock with his rubber fins? fun in movie history.
