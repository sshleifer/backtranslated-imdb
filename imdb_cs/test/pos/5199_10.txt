This film makes infantry what Das Boot did for submarines. If you appreciated Das Boot, then that's all you really need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well done movie theater. At the same level as Das Boot. Essentially, the Stormtrooper, an elite German infantry company, leaves a garrison service in an idyllic Italian coastal town and is immediately drawn into the chaos of a crumbling Russian front. A good war movie sheds light on the absurdity and brutality of war while giving us insight into the experiences and basic humanity of those who fight. This movie does it. The film is full of drama and action and is therefore also entertaining at this level.
