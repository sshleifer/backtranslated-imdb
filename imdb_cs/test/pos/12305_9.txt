"Dead" is truly a work of art. It is clear that John Huston wanted to show that he is still "in full glory of some passion" by doing it, even though his body has failed. This film is powerfully influencing and persists in the mind long after it's done. Certainly, reading Joyce's story adds more depth to the characters, especially the inner confusion of Gabriel, but the essence of this film. As a declaration of an artist about his love for life and his craft, he is "dead" alone.
