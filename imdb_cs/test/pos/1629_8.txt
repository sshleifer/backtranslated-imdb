Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new scientific experiment blows up the city. Da Vinci's code broke the record in 2006, but for the great majority of Dan Brown's followers it didn't make his award books of justice and when running in good 2 and a half hours, he seemed to carry a lot. After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempting to solve the mystery of the Louvre murder, but for angels and demons the scales were raised once more as the main star and director return. After inquiring, most people seem to prefer Da Vinci's angels and demons for fun reading, and criticism and fans, although not yet fully qualified, seem to prefer this latest release to release This picture of Howard certainly has more clinical energy and exercise than unlike Da Vinci, Robert Langdon Tom Hanks as the only night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and due to time constraints, The action and despair in the ante and bring the excitement that certainly beats the Da Vinci code, but it also creates a lot of twists and overwhelming murders Sequence. An interesting factor in this 2009 release is the constant elements that are justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences that express the feeling of total strength for the situation. This really justifies the thriller brand with constant tension and dramatic drama. problems and beliefs once again brought full work. Like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever, and Langdon is once again a key figure to show everyone the light in and between controversies of other urgent circumstances. It is fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; Certainly he likes to strain problems and dramas between his action and thrilling sequences. In addition to trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also a scenario of choosing a new Pope, dealing with a new scientific experiment, and the power of religion is once again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally debates and dialogues tend to send their minds drifting, but as there is so much in the novel, it was always probable. Ron Howard, who honestly led the ordinary type of rolling direction in Da Vinci, returns perhaps in the worst possible way. His jerky style with a moving camera does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what's happening on the screen with this sincerely framed style. He is definitely not Paul Greengrass and it is by no means Bourne. Slick and stylized it is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci
