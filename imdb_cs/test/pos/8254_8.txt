Every Sunday we provided localization services on this film, which we shot at London's Berkeley Square. David Niven liked the master very much, unfortunately his last one. We had a moment of panic when the tribal hoax Krugerrands (cast for the movie ..) dropped the storm drain. Imagine a frantic crew opening all the drains to make every last one. If you know and love London you will love this romp comedy - also begins Richard Jordan, who unfortunately died of a brain tumor. Good movie, great crew, excellent cast. looking for the current crown street stars then playing a crowd of scenes or extras. The car lot and Ivan's retail businesses were shot in West London, Chiswick's entire shopping show, and the US used car was dressed overnight, the car a lot is still there as well as stores. The restaurant suddenly turned into a funeral parlor. If you see the movie on the listings, try to see it! By the way, Sally Harrison's bank receptionist was married to production designer Tony Curtis .. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I just thought I'd add a few more comments on the places: <br /> <br /> Pub: right now next to Berkeley Square Elke Sommers Cottage: Back Road along Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Lot: along the Chiswick High Street and all the shops near the roundabout. Workshops (Reconstruction of Armored Supplies) Roundabout Factory opposite Fullers Pilsen Prison (see workshops above) Phone booth see Elke Sommers (it was a wooden studio cabinet used in many movies, look for a light cable at the edge level and wood hangers Computer room Honeywells Near the Olympic Cemetery - Chiswick - Tomb Just Beyond the Common Land Bank Interiors, Ceiling Emptiness and Fortress: Twickenham Studios <br /> <br /> And just add David Niven, the lord, joked and mixed with the crew, accessories and so on. .....
