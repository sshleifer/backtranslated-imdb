this movie even made me laugh even thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise but easy. casting can't be better. All actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play the very best, and there is no stupid laughter or scream across the film. Layers and progress of the story work perfectly and smoothly. The greatest of all is when the YMCA Village People is imported, which will bring the importance of the Indian status, which was only shortly introduced in the film, making it the smartest and funniest peak of many comedies. I give her ten times many times comedies are so underestimated.
