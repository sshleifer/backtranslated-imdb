When I first saw that this movie will play on TV, I am just a new one from the Paula Shore as this joke comic who wore really weird clothes back in the day. I still decided to watch it and I was impressed. the shore brings fresh air to the screen. in this movie, he plays a passing college advisor who probably needs his own advisor as well. Carla Gugino, in an underestimated role, plays becca, Midwestern "Farm Girl" with a simple family and film-clich√© friend Travis. when she goes to school, she meets crawling and quickly turns her into a lively, Californian girl. decides to bring home for Thanksgiving. when travis decides to design, he needs distraction. crawling then decides that everyone believes that he and becca are already engaged. this leads to crawl spice romance between beccy parents, make friends with her brother, and even get dancers at the local bar to get a little free. I won't reveal the end, but I liked it. in any case, do not rent it if you want the performance to be presented to you; to rent if you want to laugh your butt and enjoy the often missed 90s humor.
