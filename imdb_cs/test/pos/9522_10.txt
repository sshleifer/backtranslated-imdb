I have always loved French movies because I think they are filled with a lot more emotion and sense than Americans. This film is a jewel. Beginning with a wedding that is so fun that you want to join them, and finally where the little kids tell us who is with whom, who is extremely funny. Catherine Deneuve is just so hot and so good that a young man can fall in love with her and Vincen Lindon is ideal for this role. The best scene (except the wedding reception) is in a family gathering where Antoine gets angry and screams her feelings for Leo in front of her family. It's a pity that I could only buy this film from French and not English (so I have to learn in French to watch it) !!
