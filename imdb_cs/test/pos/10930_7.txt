Sam Waterston's presence as an Indian alone is enough to make this film a must-see. It is beautiful and very gentle, without any lines. He is gentle with his kidnapper, and yet we can see that he is one of the most beautiful of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a stupid cluck who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) to a beautiful white horse. Other sub-plots are really unnecessary. I don't understand the role Caroline Langrishe plays as a poor girl White Bull kidnaps ... I don't know how she holds her hands from this beautiful Indian man! It's a lot of fun; especially if you're a Waterston fan. Man, this looks GOOD !!! Harvey Keitel's role is not worth mentioning to tell the truth! But rent it and enjoy it! In fact, I believe that if the music score was better, it would be a much more dramatic movie ... music is so bad, it's distracting. Mr. Waterston is still here!
