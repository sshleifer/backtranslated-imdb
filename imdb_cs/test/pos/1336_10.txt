I called my brother Paulie's phone and said he was looking at Hoody and it was funny. As I said, never break your family! The demand for more lines is fine because I express my opinions quite often. If something is misspelled, it is most likely my eyesight and not my brain. This gives me one more chance to take the shots on "The Departed". When one knows exactly what will happen in the last scene without prior knowledge, it usually means that it was not so exciting. All you need is a good director, the same guy I trust who made my favorite mob movie, "Goodfellows", but in a completely different way. I have to see the hood to make sure it's not better than "The Departed" Gibbs
