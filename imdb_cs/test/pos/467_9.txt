Actually, I was thinking about investing in this movie when Gorman was out of funding financing. I loved most of the script, but I didn't like the end. Gorman insisted that the end was as it must be. <br /> <br /> When I see a finished movie, I have to say I'm impressed. I read the script that I didn't imagine that acting (and Gorman's leadership) was as strong and moving as it was here. Both leadership has done amazing work. They were very believable and this film is worth watching just the performance of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now for the spoiler and if you haven't seen the movie, don't read further like you have to see the movie first. (Actually, I wish I had never read the script so I could experience a movie that ends with the first hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------------- - --------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First, and I'm sure I mentioned it when I read the script, the woman was supposed to die. If she was dead, the end would be much more plausible. As it is, we have the guy who is worried about the woman who left him years ago. If she had left him and he was still in love after so long, he would have to be really deceptive. But in the script, he won't come across that. (There is also the problem of not exhausting all this energy after the wife he still loves.) In addition, if a woman were dead, we could truly believe that they had fulfilled, reciprocated love, and therefore believed that the guy is devastated enough to end up being reasonable. However, Daphne does not buy what it does at the end. I needed a hell of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive to a bitch but credible thanks to Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character just isn't cold enough. And if she made it out of some love or something else, then there's a whole piece of movie / story missing. Much of this movie reminds of "Sex, Lies, and Video Tape." I think it might be so popular if Gorman decided to give the film a more credible ending. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And invent your own mind.
