<br /> <br /> *************************** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ************ We Dive at Dawn is an English movie starring John Mills. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a large screen and I must say that the movie is better than I thought when I first saw it on the samll screen. Could it be a large screen display that helped? I keep saying that the first few segments of the movie are confused, but as soon as the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the film also starts! The search for a German battleship called Brandenburg and the adventures that went with it was immersive and the details in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I increase my rating to 7/10. If you like World War II movies, I think this will be interesting once the submarine starts. Some of the men on the sub also have a sense of humor!
