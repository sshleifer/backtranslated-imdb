The brilliance of this story brings every viewer in the audience at least one skillfully produced message. This story is about success, about failure. It's about what you do in life and what others do for you. The story deals with self-realization and determination on such a large scale that it could not be obscured by the camera's angle. Within each scene, there is an element labeled for display in your imagination. Keep this in mind while watching a movie; it's more than eye candy. Sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain during the boring character development process.
