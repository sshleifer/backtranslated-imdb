Trust an excellent and accurate Junagadh75 review! This film is convincing and moves in the harshest, most brutally most beautiful film masterpiece. Filed under UNFORGETTABLE STRONG MEAT. Or FILMS THAT ON THE PLACE. Pixote gets into the nervous system and raises you despite the onscreen pain. Here is an unrelated list of movies that have done the same for me, ie "Engaged, Destroyed, Transformed, Inspired, Resonated ... This Category Overcomes Tens of Lists That Are Looking for Movie Perfection." "Wiseblood", "Wages of Fear" "Saint Jack" "Funny Bones" "Out of the Blue".
