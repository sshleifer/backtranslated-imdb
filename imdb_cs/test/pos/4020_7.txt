Hey, everyone, jerks, the stone foxes, you mean dudes. Beware, because there's murder in town! If you're looking for a bad ass, a funky movie to watch for a night, it's true. 'Defeat' is back and trying to make it easy to n 'relax after his adventure in Mexico. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like "Duncan," you have to take revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in his first brother's or what? Everyone who. The film begins with the routine of an old "plane assassination". We all know it's the most effective way to fill a guy full of people on a picnic. Needless to say, defeat survives suffering, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes, I don't think it's lucky. SMACK!! Also killing the best friend Pratt is killed. This is the beginning of a magnificent adventure filled with the nicest, most interesting music that James Brown offers. That's right, "Godfather of the soul" put his mark on this bad boy. In addition to Jim Brown's starring role, this movie is full of some of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene offers. How about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts we see anyone but Judith M. Brown and last but not least the fantastic Don Stroud as an evil supporter.
