GoldenEye 007 is not just the best tie-in movie ever game, but it's perhaps the most influential first person shooter ever hit on the game console market. If you are not aware of this game's plot, which is not a problem because it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995 - two years before the release of the game. It is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be emulated in many of the future games that come, and gives the player a wide range of goals and challenges. A.I. it is smart (especially on higher difficulty) and the environment is complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty for each player. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hit-points to enemies is a great feature. Even the bosses in this game can be shot down with a well-aimed shot in the head. It is this type of realism that really feels like you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, secretly pull out followers, go out of alarm, and have massive firefights. For this reason, there are many ways to beat the game, and unlimited possibilities to perform your tasks. AKA: You can take simple ways or hard ways to beat levels ... and if you do not have a strategic guide, you will have to find these ways yourself (which I could add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). <br /> <br /> This is one of the games you play the more, the more you will appreciate your contribution to the gaming industry. Every time I play I noticed aspects that have been replicated in many of the following FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64 go forward and dust that sprout and order used copies of GoldenEye 007 because you trust me as a Bond fan, and an occasional player I can say that this game is highly recommended for all who want to step into James Bond's shoes, Or just have an amazing, intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also, be sure to check out his sister games, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, after the same controls and very similar weapons.)
