I'm a huge movie enthusiast and also an active rugby player who believes rugby is the biggest game they've ever played. Forever Strong is a mix of coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This film is full of great performances, well-developed characters and action shots that will bend and avoid in your seat, but with more arms than pee wee football and almost every shot cuts off when the player touches the ground. he shot almost like football. If you want your kids to see a movie that will build a character from the inside and could inspire a blind man to see again I can easily put 9 out of 10 if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows the sport you have to wait for the next because Forever Strong is mostly practice, run and one ruck movie because I give 7.75 out of 10.
