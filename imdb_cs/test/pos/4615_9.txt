I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was blown away. The panic scene opens this movie at 14:37 at Adelaide High School. This scene remains unresolved when we return to the beginning of the day and imagine teenagers going to school. Viewers become intimate with each of the main characters and explore the everyday problems faced by teenagers - including drugs, promiscuity, gays, bullying and violence. Each scene is played over and over again from different perspectives of adolescents and resembles Gus Van Santa's elephant. This is a remarkable film by Murali K. Thalluri. It was done with non-professional student actors, and work-shopped through 76 unprecedented script designs. This represents the stunning performance of many student actors, especially Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. The film coming from the ages is intimate and provocative with a surprising and disturbing ending.
