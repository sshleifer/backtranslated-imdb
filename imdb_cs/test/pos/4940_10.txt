It just happened on TV when I opened it, and when I felt too lazy to change the channel, I watched it. Man, that was lucky. This film is a fairy tale rather than a challenging drama and sometimes openly sentimental. It's definitely what you could call a film with a good feeling, and I usually get that boring or irritating. But this film is so well done that I couldn't love it. The script doesn't spin your brain; it is common but flawless. The actors are brilliant, each one perfectly suited to this role. There is not much score, but pieces of music make this movie beautifully better. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate things other than expensive pyrotechnics, bad murders or save the world in the movie, watch it sometimes you have a chance. 5/5
