Since many of today's movies are guilty, the plot is not entirely stellar, the movie does not move, and it certainly does not guarantee any awards (except for the tears) ... but then again, who really worries. Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to create a very funny, sometimes cheerful movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts. Man, I hope my wife will age in the future, just like Miss Renee. The movie is nice to avoid waiting for a video / dvd release and instead go ahead and look at it. Eddie Murphy is in his usual top-form and is downright pleasant to watch. De Niro fit perfectly into this type of role. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that any real movie fan who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. > <br /> Top Performance: Murphy. Hilarious. He said enough. Directed by: Nice. Nice action scenes, using Murphy and De Niro together as a spell, Russo made a living in nice support work. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 of 10. You won't be moving anything ... but it's a very nice movie. It's Showtime ... was a great success.
