Billy Wilder continues his strong running of films during the 1950s with biopic Charles Lindbergh, a young American pilot who became the first man to fly solo over the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh, and while he might be a little old. for this part he still brings sincere warmth and confidence, as well as his trademark, which is known to him, making him a cult film star. Wilder directs, straightens the story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh was against when he decided to accept the challenge. It certainly isn't his or Stewart's best work, but it's the gem of the film. He raises the mood with the plane and makes you proud to be an American. Overall, it's just good.
