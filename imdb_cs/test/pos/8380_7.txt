Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not reach the highest level in the last 25 minutes, but when action hits the highest speed, it brings some really amazing martial arts scenes that require viewer attention. Doesn't that mean the first hour is worthless? this is a bit unpredictable compared to the final battle festival. The story revolves around the talent of Yuk-Su, a talented comedian who dreams of being a hero? his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues Siu-Yu, a young maid who is sold to prostitution, causes her evil boss, Wa. Under the leadership of Sonny, the kung fu scorpion-style master, Wao's followers give chasers to Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father hits, but he's hurt. After being rescued by a few friendly bodybuilders, three eventually hide in a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also regularly sneaks in to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the guidance of Jean, a teacher of muscle slopes who have saved them. When Master Yat has to leave for business, Yuk-Su is left in the kitchen; however, he jumps to train his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve customers. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and are disgusted with the noodles being served and fry the restaurant. When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su is creeping out, he tells him that he should learn kung fu from him; it turns out that Master Yat used to be the top triad killer until he decided to try and change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat Yuk-Su, he improves his skills, even learning the art of a toneless kick! Yuk-Su finally gets a chance to try to become a real hero when his friend Fatty announces that his maid was also sold to prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa and act as French messenger guards looking for new women. When Fatty's maid is exposed to them, she accidentally throws out their stupidity and finally the action begins with a big style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is very badly defeated by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. When Yuk-Su returns to the restaurant, he finds himself flaming; and the worst of all, the villains found Siu-Yu! Accompanied by Master Yat, Yuk Su returns to Wa to try to save Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some rather entertaining training scenes, slow build-up to Wa's House is rather over-drawn and without any serious battle scenes. It is a pity that boredom was not broken by a decent scrap in the middle, rather than putting all the juicy things to the end. But the last fight is worth waiting for. end; Winning Jin gives the jaw a declining performance like a high kicking sonny who scuttles, flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid performance like Yuk-Su, an artist-turned-fighter. The Kung fu Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) is also exceptionally good as Yat Master who proves that this old timer still has what it takes to kick his ass! Although not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough standout events in its finals that definitely require a tour. <br /> <br /> Note. Maybe I got bad names. My DVD calls characters by different names than those listed on IMDb.
