Especially after watching MATRIX RELOADED !! * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> After seeing the Matrix with all its ridiculous fantasy make-never-robotic characters with their super power, it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in real risk situations! I took care of these people, and although some of the stunts looked a little too much, it still seemed to me that it was a "possible" verse "what a stupid video game" (like the Matrix) <br /> <br /> the movie is not a brain surgery it is very straightforward. Some things are predictable - as if we knew someone would be old and that someone would soon die. Quite obvious, but WHAT WHAT? The first 15 minutes sets our reason, our motive, our main goal. <br /> <br /> I like that Theron and Walhberg have no make-up scenes. I'm glad they didn't go there. They kept him in a funny dialogue. This guy is FUNNY! <br /> <br /> This is a movie I would buy when it comes out on DVD. It's fun, fast and fun. The only thing (and I think it's a big thing) is that we really - rooting for bad guys. This group of protaganists is already on the wrong side of the law. It's not good news for kids - parents, please explain it to them. <br /> <br />
