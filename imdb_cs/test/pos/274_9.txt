Stepford Children is Stepford's second best film on Stepford. I saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it was released in 1975. I was totally blown away, it was amazing. I've seen all the Stepford movies, and I love all of them. I think The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movie. I just watched it recently and I enjoyed it. The cast in this movie was really good to watch. Barbara Eden made a bang to work as usual. Every role she ever played was very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and caring person. was perfect in this movie. He was particularly effective in being the irritated father of his two teenagers. I made sure I got all the tapes on Stepford to enjoy it.
