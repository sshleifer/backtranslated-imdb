Chucky's back ... and it's time! This time with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. At least with this installment, the camp is back. This was so far more terrible of this series. He has a few good twists and a few good action scenes. This one was by far the funniest of the series and, if inadvertently, overcome the gap between pure horror and horror / comedy. I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It will be fun! "Jesus, the music scene is gone because I'm dead!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed the left because the doll is getting older. The added comedy and better action scenes bring this back to the same quality first when the idea was fresh and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 Fiend :.
