Meatballs have been a major star in our family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and seen it tens of times. Bill Murray is at his best and touches most of the scenes, where he reaches out to a lonely preschool boy and befriends him while leading his CIT into a once malevolent scheme after another! Cast characters are fun and zany and you really care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy, stupid, teen sex-fest. It's funny and sweet and just versatile fun. Everyone who sees it will have fun. It is visible. Beware of Spaz - it's by far the best character! (Especially during the Social Camp - while Bill Murray went for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he chooses to dance with!) By far, one of my favorite comedies ever!
