I can't believe I rarely saw this title mentioned by all the 80th horror freaks, and I'm definitely not joining all my colleagues who say 'Bloody Birthday' is a horrible watch. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the sophistication and surprising twists it offers. Don't just refer to this movie as' another 80 'slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely, and so they are murderers. We met three cherubic young people who were born during the solar eclipse. The moment they were delivered, Saturn was blocked by the sun and the moon, and therefore the children are emotionless and seemingly without conscience. This begins to show up around their tenth birthday when they go to a fierce mortal spree. It is true that this is an incredible attraction and even slightly offensive, but seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror movies from this period, at least they try to bring something original and imaginative. The children's meeting is good and the whole movie has a spooky atmosphere and grizzly music. The sequence of murders is grim and tense and it is always frightening to see them being committed by children facing angels. I don't know who hired 3 kids but did a good job. Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are very memorable. The bleak images of a heartless trio remind you of classic places like the Damned Village, Bad Seed, and the Damned Children. This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones, but great fun, and not one horror lover will regret watching this. Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not only the greatest genius in the cinema, but a pleasantly muddy boy who also brought us immensely fun cheese cheeses like "The Brain" and "Starship Invasions". If all this is not enough to convince you, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just nudity, but dance-topless MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for the totally redundant portraits of Joe Penny, later the TV series stars Jake and Fatman. Look at it !!
