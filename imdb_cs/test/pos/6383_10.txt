This movie shuddered !!!! he saw it at the screener a few weeks ago. Kinda is a strange story where James Franco plays this jerk who married Sienna Miller just to get out of the country and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. I don't want to take it away because the movie isn't released but its absolutely cool and you would never expect it to happen. I thought I'd hate it because it's his romance, but also a little twisted and I like a lot. Acting is really good and Sienna Miller is absolutely smokin 'and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should do more roles. James plays a jerk, but in the end you like it and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine is a cowboy and he's good. I gave this movie 10 because I came from the movie really like it and wanted to see again what I didn't expect, and my girlfriend really liked and cried. good day flick
