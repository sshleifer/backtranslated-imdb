The Trio is a pleasant, nostalgic journey to the first hint of desire - when it was just a simple exploration of the unknown - before we "grew up" and added the complexities of HIV status, emotional luggage, and the need to let go -pager-just-go -off into the emotional mix. Shot anxiety is purely adolescent anxiety, but it is true in all three stories. Their sweetness and positivity gives you the feeling that you are gay. And these movies are few and far away. <br /> <br /> Good news! Both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD from September 1999.
