I love this show. I hate it when it goes to the finals of the season because it looks like forever until the season begins again! I've been watching this show since her pilot tossed all the way from where the high school starts and sees Casey's sister, where Dana is now. I am also so glad that Cappie and Casey have finally come back together, which has led me crazy !!! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they will come back together, which is just a feeling that they will be in the finals. I just looked at the main cast and I'm so SHOCKED that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey Grammar !!! that it surprises me a lot and another thing that is a huge SHOCKER is that she was born in the same year as me and that she was born at my brother's birth with my year and I have not seen any help !!
