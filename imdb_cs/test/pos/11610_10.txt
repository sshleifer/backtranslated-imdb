I saw this perfection :-) during the fantasy filmfest in Berlin and when I left the cinema, I felt like "dazed"! I've seen a lot of movies, but there's only a few that I could call perfectly as koyaanisqatsi or fight the club's subconscious cruelty. half of the people left the screening in Berlin and can understand them completely! this is not a movie for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! the one who lives in his dreams every day and does not want to see all the horrors in our lives and on our planet will be very shocked by this film! if someone now reads who saw s.c. and also thinks it's great: contact me - so far I haven't met anyone who shares my opinion - it would be great !!! This movie earns 10 points out of 10 !!! finally i'm really sorry about my bad english-i'm not a studied person !!! (und das ist auch gut so * g *)
