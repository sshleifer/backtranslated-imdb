This is Lucio Fulci's best. If only all the movies he made were like this. This extraordinary movie is as interesting as Dario Argento's "Bird with Crystal Feather" ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Argento fan but you don't like Lucio Fulci movies like < br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The Cemetery House", etc. with others ... that's what the Italians call "giallo" ... that would be something like "who -It's done a movie in a nutshell. Who is the killer until the last moments of the movie. But besides, there's a conspiracy: some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys ... Journalist (Tomas Milian), sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and the Witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters in this tangled, bloody story. Speaking of actors, I want to say that Tomas Milian is great (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is amazing with the village witch ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who she is murderer? ... <br /> <br /> I can't tell you ... but I can tell you that you have to see this movie!. <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
