I've seen this movie three times. In the 1980s, he returned to the video recorder and night on Encor (February 11, 2010). Based on a real story that I remember being in the news in the early 1980s, I decided to watch it too distracting again. Yet it's hard to turn away from a car accident. The most horrible character is Joshua John Miller, who plays little brother Keean Reeves. (The story on which this film was based can be found anywhere on the Internet - just Google. It is Anthony Jacques Broussard who murdered Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California in 1981.) Generation X for -grunge, border sociopaths, with the exception of Keeanu Reeves, who is growing conscience. Old hippies have done a great job that has raised this generation. young boy, I thought Joshua Miller was great as a serial killer in the making. In fact, he went to Yale, and wrote the screenplays as well as directed. His acting skills in this film were amazing. Just as he treats his little sister by drowning his doll and tears her doll's grave, he gave me a chill. It gave me nightmares. Even with what's going on in today's world, in 2010, it's still the most degenerate movie I've seen to this day. Apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to make one of them vomit. This thrill killer almost makes Manson's murders pale in comparison. Crispon Glover got too much into the characters. He entered David Letteren to discuss his role, and almost kicked the host in the head. Glover obviously had to look for psychiatric help after describing his character. Also fight in a good fight with big Dennis Hopper. You're one of the best!
