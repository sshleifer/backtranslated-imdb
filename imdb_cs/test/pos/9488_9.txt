The only Zeppelin record I saw before this DVD is The Song Remains the Same '1976. Previously we spent hours around the house of friends watching it, but I never really liked it and hated fantasy sequences. .. <br /> <br /> So what about this DVD? I didn't know it existed until I saw a CD with physical graffiti ..... "When did it work out?" I thought, <br /> <br /> For some reason, I thought Page wasn't big A live guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD has changed my mind is a massive understatement. <br /> <br /> "White Summer" has been available since 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar magic. There's an Acoustic Kit Available From 1975 - "Bron-y-aur Stomp" has a great finger section for picking up improvisation. <br /> <br /> The performance "My Dying Time" and "Trampled Underfoot" (also since 75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham tearing things like no one else has. Demonic property rawk !! The spell continues to Knebworth 1979. The rendition of the "last Achillies booth", due to their different drug conditions, is just begging for faith! A song of complex guitar overdubs, Page has arranged it in a way that allows it to live just "punk" - the effect is absolutely fascinating. "In the evening" - I never liked this on the disc, but here the zings. 'Sick Again' - a great piece of sleaze-rock. Knebworth shots are very interesting, cutting between large screens, various stages and bootleg images with great effect. The plant is amazing in all shows. Page, though painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old boy who has the most fun of his life at the Knebworth concert - and is contagious. One thing that confused me - Black Dog 'performance from 1973 sounds very' camped '!! Robert Plant has always loved a little "ground" and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and today it would require arrest. Everything very different from the muscle-bound kick-and-$ $ studio version. <br /> <br /> I like this DVD. It reminded me of how good Zeppelin was.
