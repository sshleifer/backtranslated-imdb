This is a wonderful short comedy - one of Keaton's best. With a long series of stupid mistakes, Buster is wrong with the wanted killer. As a result, most of the film consists of running from police officers and especially one detective. Although I am generally not a fan of movies with lots of scenes, this is the absolute best in terms of pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I've seen some who have wilder pieces, but none where the star was so motionless and able to move with amazing grace. In particular, there is a scene where it runs across the table, jumps to the man's shoulders and plunges through the pass as easily as humanly possible. In addition, as many gags are witty and perfectly timed as they really believe he actually killed someone. Incidentally, this film is very similar to COPS, also Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to pay off to see them. <br /> <br /> This movie is great, and the only Keaton I can think of is that I liked even more PLAYHRAD - where Buster plays every role in the theater.
