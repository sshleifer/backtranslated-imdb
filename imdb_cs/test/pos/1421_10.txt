WARNING: Could contain some small spoilers. It's hard to say anything wrong with this movie, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU MUST NOT DISPLAY THAT THEY ARE ANY! !! Then again, maybe it's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch him with the Fox Film Channel. Too bad because it is another gem lost on time, Clifton Webb takes his patented sour, know-it-all behavior that perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and sequel), and turns "Nature Boy". Actually, it is. Webb plays Robert Jordan as a guest of a Sunday children's education program that loses audience share, and the network divides him to do something about it or otherwise. Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host does not have children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But as these things happen, the local pastor of the church needs a leader for a devious group of scouts and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER' ... in the host so Jordan will take the position. > <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> MEANS !!! This is a movie there are other problems. For example, it turns out one of the Scouts is the son of his boss on a television station, causing little friction; especially because the child is overweight, has an asthma and attitude. And he is the more sensible. It's also a Cub Scout, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to hang out, he's a stray puppy. As it turns out, the reason is that he has no people of his own, but a relative who doesn't have them is taking care of them. It's something that makes his job harder than expected. All in all, Webb is becoming more understandable to children and not only will it save his show, but also learn to reward, and eventually Mike. <br /> <br /> After a great movie all these years.
