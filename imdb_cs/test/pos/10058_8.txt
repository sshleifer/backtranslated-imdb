When I see a movie, I usually look for fun. But of course, as far as I know what the genre is, then I'll look for what to do. For example, if it is a deep film, I expect the film to appear in my skull and wonder what it says. But who is the girl? is not a deep film. But it's fun. It's a nice movie that's a pleasure to watch. There is hardly a boring moment in the movie and there are lots of funny parts. I watched it when I was younger. Casting is always fun as usual. I had a little crush on Griffin Dunne, though he was not a typical male heart at that time. Haviland Morris also stars. And the late Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too! Overall, joy!
