Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his most respected films; Between two extremely popular and critically acclaimed paintings, subconscious, and shady doubts, this is generally considered a minor effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking and for the first time brought Hitchcock into the American mainstream, but Saboteur is in the way at least as vivid as Suspicion; his main fault is his less than charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. In Saboteur, Hitchcock feels his way around America, literally, as his main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist whose crime he was accused of. Cummings is very youthful and very engaging. His boyishness (but not immaturity) perfectly suits the character he portrays, and it seems appropriate because the director, though middle-aged, was in the process of rediscovering himself and an older, more established star could throw things away. Priscilla Lane is a spunky heroine who is not a typical type for the director, was a very common type in American movies at the time; and she and Cummings provide the openness and youth the director needed in his life and work. I can't imagine older, firmer types, such as Cooper and Stanwyck, who do better than they should carry too much luggage. Just like the norm in Hitchcock's films, nothing seems to be. Where Saboteur differs from his more famous films, it is that viewers return to the game soon. Though Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know he's innocent. Thieves soon show up; and the film is more dependent on its plot than on its irony. What pleasure are random and Master will not disappoint. There is interesting, Tod Browningish intertwine with some circus freaks who help Cummings escape capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's bride from Frankenstein, Cummings spends some time in a blind man's cottage, which turns out to be Uncle Lane. Was the director perhaps studying American key films from the past decade? Whether this is the case, these and other unusual and discursive aspects of the film give him playfulness and diversity, which, when one adds a factor of youth, makes the image look like the work of a younger man who is still learning his craft. The later movie scenes in New York are more exciting and typical for the director, as the image becomes more and more Hitchock's when he moves. Finally, I consider it a satisfying job; and as neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, no film has one. It is deliberately light and I suspect it is semi experimental; Hitchcock's attempt to see if he could get rid of the story that he did so well in the US. He was successful. Another logical step: Shadow of doubt, a movie in which the main character travels east to west, and with a totally different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
