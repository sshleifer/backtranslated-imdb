My wife and I watched this amazing movie this evening because we're going to watch Russian dolls tomorrow and the first thing is important to see before the other. We both loved Spaniah and enjoy some of the characters in the early years of our lives - now in St. Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified ourselves a bit with the rough storyline because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the script wasn't entirely strange to our early lives. Our living was very different, but as with this film, whenever you throw together young people who go through the same lifecycle as the people of the developed world, they will experience the same life situations. The collection of people and the personal difficulties they faced were versatile, with the beauty of this film and probably its sequence tomorrow. As I wrote, the characters and these situations are all well known to all of us, so we can enjoy life. This must be one of the greatest powers of the film - allowing the viewer to experience the emotional upheavals of the people involved, yet stay away. The viewer can chuckle at this distance and think, "I wouldn't do something that would be so stupid" or "I would avoid the trap." Maybe that's why we're going to the movies.
