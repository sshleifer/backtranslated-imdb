I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on Jonathan Safran's novel Foer, he is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. The script was also written by Schreiber. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from brushes to brushes to attachments to pieces of paper, which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to the wall in his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is strikingly plain. Jonathan really has a gem and an old photo with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during World War II. Jonathan decides to take a search in Ukraine to find a woman, thank her and learn more about his grandfather. His search is supported by several characters who run a tourist company for Jewish people, including a young man obsessed with Western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and who can have memories and own demons from the war, and his grandfather's lively doggy. > <br /> The scenario effectively combines both humor and drama because the three characters travel through the countryside looking for Jonathan, the grandfather's city, to go deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugen Hutz, playing Alex Jr, who starts the film as a tracksuit, breaks the dancing slacker just to have fun, but develops more than just Jonathan, but all the characters get their own lighting. Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz took part in the screening and made a very funny question after the film: Schreiber was very close to his grandfather who was a Ukrainian immigrant who died in 1993 That made him start writing to remember the paper. In the meantime, he was asked to read the story of Foer's short story, "A Very Rough Search", which was an excerpt from an unpublished novel. Schreiber was torn out by the quality of writing, said that Foer did in 15 pages what Schreiber had attempted to do in 107. Schreiber addressed Foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, movies, and the nature of short-term memory in America; In the end, Foer agreed to Schreiber to customize the book. Schreiber's own project was supposed to be a road movie, but the book has a parallel story that represented the chronological history of Trochenbrod that goes beyond 500 years; in view of his budget and constraints as a filmmaker he said he left it to Milos Forman and instead went on a trip. This presented chronology was what moved him to create the film in the first place, the idea that "the past lovingly presented was just as valuable as the past was remembered". Schreiber said the movie is a series of lucky accidents. After unsuccessfully seeking actors in Ukraine, he walked down the bottom of East New Side in New York, seeing a poster of a centaur woman, without a waist, with a mad cossack sitting astride her. The name of the poster was called Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. Then Eugene Hutz took over the story. He never tried to play as music was his first passion. One day a book was given to him by a friend and he thought he was written in a similar way to writing music; screw sentences / syntax, language is my own. Later they got a call from a production company looking for Central European music that was medieval but modern. Hutz met Schreiber and he soon found a film based on a book he just read. Not long after it came, Schreiber asked Hutze what he thought of Alex, and if he could do any chance. Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11th. They were both in Europe at the time and talked about the derogatory comments they heard about the Americans, which led Schreiber to try to find an American American who would resist the stereotype that Europeans have of Americans. Someone who was embarrassing, vulnerable, defective, innocent and looking for history beyond his own country. Schreiber began to think about who he was, and Elijah came. One of Schreiber's inspiration as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think he said it, who also directed the segment in another festival film, All Invisible Children), who said, "You're not looking for actors, you're looking for people." Schreiber said there was something about who Elijah was, that he had a generosity of spirit and sincere goodness as a human being who appeared on the film. Schreiber said that eyes are important when trying to formulate a figure who is an observer and that if "eyes are the door of the soul, Elijah is a garage door." Elijah Wood talked about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie, because they are some sort of empty slate that reflects emotions. Wood replied that Jonathan might seem calm and seemingly emotionless, but it's all about his observations, his experiences with other characters, and the environment he was in. About the Difference Between Directing and Writing: Schreiber said he likes to write much more and jokingly described direction as "hell". After his grandfather died, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve a sense of history and himself; is content controlled or not, or just interpreting other people's work well? He said he loves exercise to find out what's emotional to you, important to you.
