I was surprised how I liked it. Sure, it's a little slow moving around, but what else would Rollin expect? Also there is a lot of nudity, nothing wrong with it, especially since it contains a lot of wonderful, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some magnificently erotic women dead, a little more evasive, perhaps, but most effective. There is also science fiction as a story with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't bother too much with it. No, here's the most interesting memory exploration and memory loss, and the extent to which one is still "alive" without memory. My DVD cover mentions David Cronenberg, and although it may not be as good as his best films, there is a certain similarity, especially with the great use of seemingly terrifying architecture and effective and scary use of inner space. As I tried to suggest that it is by no means a ripping roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare-like movie that makes most of its sites, including the stunning rail settings at the end.
