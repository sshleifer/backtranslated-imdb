Wow, don't look like it's going to be a relaxing circus night! It will keep you on the edge of your seat to the end. The circus has never been more colorful, exciting and breathtaking! The whole concept is really amazing. You take the world of Cirque Du Soleil and stay with thousands of thoughts when you leave. There is only one thing left to do: get a CD and / or a DVD and live again and again. Becoming Addicted! It's worth it! Must be next to the most beautiful things in the world and one of the best programs of Cirque Du Soleil.
