I will say from the outset that I am not a certain fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed fascinates me with a message of perspective. In ancient times people who inhabit Midian would be called a zombie, undead. And from what Clive Barker gave us some members of the human species, they were born in Craig Sheffer with the potential to become part of this world. Psychiatrist David Cronenberg initially looked like a slightly bred professional took on a fanatical mission to rid the world of Nightbreed. She shocks the police to kill Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a cemetery called Midian Cemetery where Nightbreed meets and lives underground. Sheffer also left his girlfriend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings about him, even after he was killed and is now one of the undead. He tries to become a bridge to humanity in a small way. The creatures of Clive Barker are pretty horrible and not particularly fond of people. But it is clear that if people leave them alone, the nightclubs do not bother them. Your sympathy is definitely with Nightbreed, especially when they saw fanatics like Cronenberg and Redneck Police Chief Charles Haid. Action. Clive Barker was out gay for some time and some suggested that Nightbreed is a homosexual metaphor. I see where it might come, especially because there are a lot of people who don't think of homosexuals as something human because they are taught that way. With lots of gratuitous violence, it also does that you think and I like how Clive Barker takes the traditional theology to head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for Nightbreed creation.
