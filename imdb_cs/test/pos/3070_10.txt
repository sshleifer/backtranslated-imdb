SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- It's happening. From introductory credits to final credits, this film is laughing. Dave Chappel shows why he's a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the film most of the time, but the supporting cast fills the powerful when the storyline is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the start, this film claims that it should not be taken seriously by itself. If you took the time machine and gave the characters the ideas of the modern day, you would have this movie. What makes this movie special, what do you say? Throughout the film, you can see the blink and the acuhu walk side by side and become great friends like Robin Hood sidekicks. But Blinken never says or can understand that he is black, until the crowd says "black sheriff", Blinken plays "He is black". This is a timeless scene. A simple one of the most fun movies of our time.
