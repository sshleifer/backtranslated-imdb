The cast is admirably chosen and balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is beautiful because all the music of Burt Bacharach is and is suitable for the plot line. Making a musical version of the Hilton story is a welcome change in how it is done. We see experienced actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of the film. It's the treasure of the silver screen! Find it if you can - and let your spell take you away from the poison of everyday worries, inspiring you to find your own "Lost Horizon".
