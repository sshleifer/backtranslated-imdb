I am deeply grateful to have seen this film. Acting is overwhelming, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the issues it deals with are solved with subtlety and depth. This is an important movie. It could be deeply transformative. <br /> <br /> I'd pay good money never, ever see again. Because it is so good and so complicated, it is very difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies tends to be a little fun; the visual medium may be so strong that I will try to avoid it for something really important. Those of you who have more courage than me can more easily manage. But I strongly encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to each other and have someone reminding you that there is more to the world than film.
