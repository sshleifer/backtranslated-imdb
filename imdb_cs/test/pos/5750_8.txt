I'm a Christian, and I think this movie was pretty good! :) While the acting wasn't an Academy Award caliber, I thought it was good, given that the cast had limited acting experience when this movie was made. The Gospel Message and the Transforming Force Jesus Christ has been beautifully explained. The message that the director tried to overcome (which is an important thing, not how the characters dressed!), Certainly went through. The theme that the main characters are involved in illegal dragging was also a good idea (cool muscle cars, btw). I think this movie will certainly appeal to a lot of young people. Definitely I recommend this movie, it's a great tool for testimony! :)
