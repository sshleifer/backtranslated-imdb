Just as director John Madden comes to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz to play the role of Italian officer and Greek villagers in an honest story: "Captain Correli's Mandolin", I'm just escaping! Witness: A fluctuating, inconsistent Cage accent in the midst of a terrible replay, with Cruze - a better cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in "Blow" - basically a repetitive performance under the veil of a Greek sister ... It was painful. But there were saving graces. The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage has some (- redeeming, that's! -) musical ability. Furthermore, the great performance of John Hurt (father's father, village doctor) Oscar Callibre, as well as Irene Papas, each of whom as villagers older, as well as Christian Bale (Papas's son) among the villagers' freedom fighters, go far to counter-balancing embarrassing performances especially at the beginning) Cruz and Cage. It seems that the last two are growing into their roles as the film progresses, but it's teeth that will soon tease. Finally, the scenery itself and the photo could get a technical award, thus providing a pleasant distraction when it is most needed. John Hurt has two Oscar nominations, which would be the third; I hope he gets it as his performance because the doctor makes this movie worth seeing. The real test of the supporting actor is whether the film would be the same without the personality in question, and in this case it would certainly not be ... or close. Entertainment but for the aforementioned plus factors that help raise the bar. Look, if not. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
