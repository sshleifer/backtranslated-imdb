In his work, director Visconti stands out from the first scene to the last scene of the film, as the film is made to remain as a cultural treasure only for God, how long it takes. It's perfection - like a film, that means the story has some minor flaws. Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect work of art, so of course it is not possible to bring it to another medium. Visconti follows the story to a great extent, and it is only when it is allowed to deviate slightly from the transition. And no matter how beautiful the scenery is, the tension in the air between the characters, hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, almost unbearably strengthened by Mahler's music - still, the minor anomalies in the plot are disturbing me. Maybe I'm just a victim of human desire for mistakes. However, I will offer one example that I consider crucial. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats strawberries that probably contain a disease that kills him after giving up the frustrated persecution of Tadzia in Venice. Unable to catch one joy, he settles down for another - which poison him. It's very subtle in the book, but it's there. Forbidden fruit, species, but rather a sign of giving up life alone. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti movie, he also feeds on strawberries, but on the beach it is a somewhat insignificant scene. The Chase in Venice ends much more melodramatically. It also works, but it lacks some subtlety, indeed, and also a multilayered symbolism, giving food for thought. But that's all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful scenery, faces and constellations, and certainly so many other symbols we can spend - the final gesture of Tadzia standing in the water, which is equally noble and mysterious final.
