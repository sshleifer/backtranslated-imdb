I loved this show. Actually, I left the pub ten minutes before closing and ran down the road to catch him. I recall Daniel Peacock's sketch of Gandhi in a newspaper as a masterpiece. Set design and lighting were out of this world and created the atmosphere in which you felt you were actually living. In unusual for comedy. Unfortunately, I only met one other person (among others here) who ever knew this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for having started to exist and proving to me that I didn't really imagine the whole series in a drunken haze that I really started to believe!
