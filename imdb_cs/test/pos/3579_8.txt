Blue planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? Years of hard work have paid off for what is undoubtedly one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The sights and sounds presented at Blue Planet, like most Attenborough stamped documents, are rare and most people have not experienced. This in itself should be a sufficient reason to buy this series, especially if you are a curious type that "wants to know". But the blue planet is not the perfect document. After the third episode it repeats a little. How many different sea creatures can swim, kill, poop, mother and lay eggs, and all these ways need to be explored? But if you are deeply interested in marine life, this repetition should not become a problem for you at all.
