"The Cabinet of the Earth" was sponsored by Amnesty International and has a lot of political undertones, but it is much more than this richly encouraging story ... <br /> <br /> It's not just about political tensions in the late 1980s - it's about personal the persecution that a woman receives as a child who has been harassed by a family friend. We see a subtle allusion to the parallels of dishonest government / social structure and sexual predation culture, where one in four young children is harassed and one in three women has experienced some form of rape. Pro Brings the question of how chickens and eggs behave: is it creating an attitude of our sexual oppression that leads to predation, the political environment of fear and censorship, or is it stimulating the socio-political dysfunction of a culture of sexual predation? The psychological consequences that force us to lay us down force us to a place where we are led to develop our own responses. Finally, our young lady writer (Stowe) has a similar moment to the one that appears here. the end of Hensen's "labyrinth" - at one bright, brilliant moment, he realizes that the idea that her power is stolen by the secret police (Rickman) is an illusion. No one can steal your power - it can only deceive you to give up, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that should be inserted lightly, and you will definitely enter it. The minimalist aspects associated with children's animation evoke the deepest parts of the psyche and leave the viewer unchanged.
