Exactly what you expect, and then some. The first film was a step from a TV show with stunts that were uncensored and excited. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. Stunts have become more dangerous and magnificent, with some thoughts blowing painful opposites sprinkled with a good amusing parody, so that this smile turns into a curl of disgust. Knoxville, as always, dominates driving, but this time he has a reason to focus on becoming a volunteer for the most dangerous and dullest of all stunts. , despite the fact that his image has been refined in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous wild boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to be taking part in less of a parody, even if it is a focal point in previous trips. <br /> <br /> If you love Jackass or Dirty Sanchez then you'll definitely enjoy this movie, and will laugh your courage at 100 minutes of its duration, if you see it is a childish, disgusting or sad shot of today's youth culture, her as offencive as always. So f ** k off.
