I saw this movie in Wales in July. It deals with the courage of Czech pilots who have flown on numerous missions for the RAF after their country was occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the event takes place both in the early 1950s, when these pilots are defeated in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. After returning to their homeland, they were imprisoned because the Communist regime considered these warriors a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. Pilots retain dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a love sub-plot that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers have made great sacrifices for the preservation of democracy. The end of this film suggests that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in the country, which was then called Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was created with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
