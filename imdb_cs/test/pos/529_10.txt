I absolutely loves this movie! Because I don't want to go too far, it's basically about mother and daughter and the life they have together. It is a very pleasing story between the struggle they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the movie! It's definitely worth seeing! Two inches up, up!
