A friend brought me this movie and at first I hesitated, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were appealing, it's like watching than watching. It turned out to be overwhelming throughout the film, the way the director managed the life scenes to reflect reality was confused, but somewhat overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a living person rather than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales have taken care of their roles so well that it is more about telling their own stories. In fact, they used their real name in the movie.
