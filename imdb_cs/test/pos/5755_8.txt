It is a gem of film, slapstick violence and-lots, Simon pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious power plant and an uncontrollable motorbike are added to this Stonker. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, I can highly recommend it, maybe not as good as the bottom, but not too short. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen a man who was stuck on two hooks then what you are waiting for to buy this movie. I didn't even see the ending when Ritchie and Eddie were both ghosts. Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
