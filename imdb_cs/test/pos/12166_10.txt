This short fascinates me. All I have seen as far as it looks is some work by Sam Brakhage, the creator of Star Man. But where Brakhage is trying to disturb us by "teaching us how to see it again" and insulting us with headaches that evoke bright colors and flashes (which I still totally kicked and embraced as high art ...), the film I would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotic. The general use of rotating objects / Man Ray camera does not create as dizzying, but the warm flow of senses, blending and continuing with the gravity of the moving world around us. An interesting idea from this very short work is that as it goes along, objects become increasingly recognizable until we end up on the naked torso (which I feel is the least feminine well-rounded breast) what I have ever seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light over the hull make it an object of surreal beauty, something you could hang on the wall and dive forever. It's because of this and other pictures in this movie that I had to watch over and over again (eventually seven times) just because I was absolutely fascinated. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
