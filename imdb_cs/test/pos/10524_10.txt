Since this movie was released 8 years before I was born, I don't feel too long to look for it for so long. However, in January 98, I attended the second year of the Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in Austin, Texas. A special theme of the films of the night was "The Neglected 1970s of Crime Films". "Gravy Train (or Dion Brothers, as it seemed this print)" was an absolute jewel. Wonderful shows, unpredictable characters, intelligent conspiracy, cheerful comedy and great time. You rarely see a crime movie that is so fun and fresh. Margot Kidder is also very sexy in one of her earliest film appearances. I hope that some wired network will seize this film and allow much more to see. Meanwhile, go to the indie video store and hope they have it.
