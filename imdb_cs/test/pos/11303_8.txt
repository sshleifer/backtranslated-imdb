For once Barbie movie that is good. I am 18 and I am embarrassingly saying it, but I am addicted to these films. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I fell in love with him. He is as cute as an ice bear and totally in love with Aiden. I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up hope and eventually it works. I love this movie and hopefully there will be other good ones. Barbie and Swan Lake is another great movie. I would recommend this movie to children of all ages (and boys) because the movie is so good and it's hard to please. Barbie and the magic of Pegasus is a movie that is charming and exciting.
