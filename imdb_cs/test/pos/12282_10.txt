he loved the story of a guy trying to get his girl back .... he was there, he did it, so I can relate ... however, I love the camera work as occasionally the camera gets "left on" and they just sit there talking about the scene or other things ... or how the camera follows him around to find the cast and what not ... I watched it at IFC sometime last year and I loved it, so I said a few of my friends about it, and some of them he was watching, and they too loved it ... check it out if you can, a little girly but its still a good movie ... i gave it 10/10 because of two reasons ... one: i can relate .. But anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate to ... two: his truly creative way to make a movie, it's just like you're always there, right in the middle of the shoot ... as I said, great movie
