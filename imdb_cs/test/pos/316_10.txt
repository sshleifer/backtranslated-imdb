During the final attacks of the Vitnam War, our central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), is broadcast by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a US Navy Commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who allegedly is "crazy" but who it successfully conducts a private cross-border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore non-limited country. The whole narrative of what Willard sees and does as he is transported along the Da Nang River by an undisciplined and terrorized naval patrol crew to Kurtz's murder is a great metaphor of overweight, decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: we do not understand something and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz finally recognized it. If you don't pay full attention to every emotional gesture, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible film for every word of dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where they are both in Kurtz's dark lair. Kurtz's gentle agreement with his executioner, his one-sided "surrender" in exchange for Willard's approval (nodding?), To tell Kurtz a "son" (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the movie) the truth about all the Horrors, which both have seen in Vietnam is what develops in mind. The connection between the two men, while Kurtz examines Willard, - interlaced by some of his own horror stories, is incredible, nay, genius, film. The final scene of the ritual killing of the sacrificial bull is the only strongest symbol. Coppolla has done, intentionally or not, a final anti-war statement that should resonate over the ages.
