Along with almost every image of the Republic ever made, "Murder in the Music Hall" seems to have irreversibly faded into oblivion. Too bad because this seductively made, professionally directed and written and weird, mysteriously tense item spins an alluring whodunnitic thriller against Radio City Music Hall. Murder in one of the most beautiful studio apartments in the building casts suspicion of seductive rockets - among them Vera Ralston (who in addition to the appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerability provides several dazzling figures for skating), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delicate B -film starfish of the 40s. The tall, blond and handsome William Marshall (usually cast in musicals) hunts the killer as the complex and ever more horrifying plot unfolds, against the holiest setting you'll ever see in the noir movie. The end is just as surprising as this sadly forgotten, classy secret of murder. Well worth restoring and reviving on cable TV, VHS or DVD. The Republic has sunk a hefty budget in this Grade-A production and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as neat, disturbing, and extremely enjoyable as any of the major films of its time. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rapsodic song that the victim presents just before his death. Then, in the midst of the constant shake of the showgirls in the locker room, try to pinpoint the one who beats this fateful melody. You'll find out who the killer is like William Marshall. Great fun, a kind of movie that they don't really do, and what a loss - both for the audience and the actor.
