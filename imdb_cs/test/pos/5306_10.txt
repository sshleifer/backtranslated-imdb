Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does "tri-fecta" (writes, directs and animates film), he makes a classic film for ages. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. The story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her father's younger sisters, a bitter ex-human guide named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from his father and goes to the jellyfish ashore where he is caught in a dredging operation and found himself in a bottle. This underwater succession must be one of the most sophisticated cartoon animated scenes they have ever taken, standing on their own as a reason to find a theatrical release. Miyazaki, who is not afraid of having a busy scene, overcame herself. At the same time, hundreds of individually stretched sea creatures of all imaginable sizes were moving. When the fish escape from the dredging operation while still trapped in a bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke sees her in the water and can smash it and save it. Being the result of her father's magic, she is capable of spell herself - and her father is actively trying to get her. The boy names the fish Ponyo. Just as Sousuke learns that Ponyo can talk, her father will get her back into captivity. After the war with the will of his father, Ponyo will once again escape with the ability to turn into a human. She meets Sousuk again in the storm and the story continues from here in many interesting ways. There is a cutoff factor in this film rival and probably surpass that of Tonari not Totoro. Joe Hisaishi again provided excellent music support. The story itself is simple - just like Miyazaki's films in general - and should reach a wide range of viewers. Even though I wasn't enough to be sure, the movie doesn't seem to be the one who would lead scholars in long discussions like Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi. However, this is the ultimate feel-good fun movie. I gave the film ten out of ten reviews.
