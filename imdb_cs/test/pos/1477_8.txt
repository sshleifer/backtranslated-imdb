You will like Sam Elliott (Falon): a trusted cop who is remarkably loyal to his partner. But too loyal and too vindictive to see his partner dead in the alley will cause him to kill who he thought he was an attacker before giving him a chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and it tends to rock him from being in self control, though he manages to direct his attention to finding who is really behind his death partners. He carries alongside the novice as his new partner (which seems to be seen too often in the movies) but Esai Morales does well in the accompaniment of Sam Elliot, though the mysterious pieces begin to throw to where Morales begins self-sanctioned investigation to Falon; he wants to find answers mainly because Fallon won't let him get into the whole story and he doesn't like what he finds. There is no last moment that shows who the bad detectives are, which is fine; and they are not able to swing the Falon into joining them, leading to a dramatic ending. Gentle talk around the world, with the humor of Paul Sorvin, who is the captain of detectives. It's a good movie that will want to see you several times; So it qualifies as a -Must see-, and a good addition to the movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
