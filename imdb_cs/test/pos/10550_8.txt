This is a funny movie, not many. OK, the plot is a little intrusive, but very original. Teens are trying to get along with Dad because he wasn't around and almost sent him to jail because he lies to impress the older boy, how could it be funny? Moreover, it is not a typical movie featuring teens. The first remake I saw, that's better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor it would be perfect 10 because he plays all the roles in the same way, sucks. Another problem is that all women are hiding over it, it is not believable at a distance, it is not attractive!, Y had a rubber troll that looked better than him, come on!
