I like Breillat's movies, but this is the best I've seen when balancing animal heat with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric and the screenplay is amazing - especially given that she should be on the scene of another Breillat movie. You don't have to agree to get out of this. I've been thinking a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a male director with the openness of Jeanne - it's not impossible, but a little overwhelming. Unannounced sexual subconscious, which is always present when people meet to do anything, is held here by bright light, but not by cold light.
