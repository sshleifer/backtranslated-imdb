This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! The poem is beautiful! Does he describe exactly the feeling of a man who pursues a dream and cannot realize it? but it also says how to do it! I see the "Cat and Moon Story" as one beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. It's technically such a good job. Despite the fact that animation in black and white is very simple, it gives the film and its message a tone of allegory, but also tenderness and nostalgia. Depending on the music, it also contributes to this poetic feeling. "Nothing else matters! I'll wait! He'll come when he can, or he wants!"
