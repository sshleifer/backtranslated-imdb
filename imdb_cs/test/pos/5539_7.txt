If you're looking for a no-so serious crowd movie, with a woman as a leader, you're in the right place. Pfieffer was much better than this. You can see she matured outside this picture. When I first took this film up, I expected Pfeiffer to be wrong wrong, however, she plays her role as a crowd wife on the handle. It's not a bad performance from Baldwin, either. <br /> <br /> If you don't pay attention to your hair, you can enjoy this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
