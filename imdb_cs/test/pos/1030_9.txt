Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it's too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series of about the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I'd pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so hard to get Oppenheimer on DVD that can be played in the US? Another very nice series, again from about the same time, was "Danger UXB". UneXploded Bombs Abuse Series, hence the name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
