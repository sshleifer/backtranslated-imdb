Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who does almost anything to win over his mistress, who in this case is Juhi Chawla. Little Juhi knows in the film that Shahrukh has a great buzz on her and keeps track of her. I have to admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty scary ... like imminent phone calls. I will never forget the line in my life, "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" It's too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "together" in the movie. But Juhi and Sunny are doing a pretty good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role was psychotic enough, I still think he did a great job of playing it, and he can't imagine anyone else doing that role. No wonder he got a prize for Darra in the 94 '! Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other movies, but Darr gave her a wonderful picture! <br /> <br /> As for music ... it was great! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs. I also thought that "Tu Mere Samne" was also pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Must See All! Overall, Darr deserves 9/10!
