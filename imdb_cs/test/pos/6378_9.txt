I saw Teen Devian in 1993 aired in Doordarshan on Friday night, and could barely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. Was it blowing the mind? a film with a "modern" story, excellent music, three beautiful ladies and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual story, Dev falls in love with three women? simple Nanda, ravishing Kalpana and sophisticated Simi. They too are in love with him and want to marry him. This puts Deva in a dilemma (which is the heart of the storyline) - who to marry?. She discusses a hypnotist who asks Dev to look into the crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and takes Nandu. Beautifully directed (probably Dev saheb himself and not Amarjeet official director) B&W classic has evergreen music? some of the best songs by SD Burman (helped generously by RD Burman). "Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth" is probably the most most vulnerable song ever composed in Hindu movies. Credit should also be awarded to Majrooh Sultanpuri for writing unforgettable Teen Devian lyrics is a lush musical that absolutely suited the style of Dev Anandu and full justice to this role. Unfortunately, Teen Devian has never received the recognition and popularity he deserves richly. <br /> <br /> I've got to see all Hindu movies, I'll rate the everlasting favorite of 9.5 out of 10.
