This occurred to me while watching "Imaginary Heroes" that every screenwriter trying to do a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing a baby or two in the opening disc as a way to get your characters open and reveal. There must be something to this story because it looks like every other family drama that comes pike uses this device in one form or another ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the last examples that spring immediately in mind, even if one could go back to a golden old man like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate topic for serious movies that need to be explored. that, like any other theme, it can be so exaggerated that it becomes just another film cliché, a comfortable piece of narrative shortening to get the ball moving and the characters they will face for the rest of the time we get to spend with The last such work is "Imaginary Heroes", a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the first and perhaps best known examples of a "family" parallels with the death of the baby genre, the Academy Award winning "ordinary people." Like the characters in this earlier film, Travises on the surface seems to be the ideal suburban family, until one fateful day, their eldest son, Matt, who is the "golden" athlete. boy ", and thus an apple. his father's eye kills without explanation (one minor difference is that the son in "ordinary people" dies as a result of an accident, not suicide). He is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who is trying to find a body and who takes on the role of protagonist in the film. Each of the remaining members of the family will deal with the tragedy in their own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, is becoming more and more alienated from his father, who has practically ignored him for the rest of his life and is turning to drugs for surrealists. Ben, the father, swallows feelings of regret and guilt, turns away from his work and family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complicated feature in the film, a single child of the 1960s who feels strangely admired in the role of mother and wife, because in principle she endures a marriage without love. He spends most of his time following a tragedy that tries to make contact with her smoke past. As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" appears as a wildly uneven film. For every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that seems arbitrary and inattentive. Sometimes one feels that Harris would like to imitate every possible life situation he could think of in his script, an admirable goal, perhaps one that would unnecessarily murmur in that movie. Instead of identifying with the characters and being trapped in their situation, we often think: "Oh, come on? What next?" For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hot-button themes in this movie; the scenario also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illnesses, even unintentional gay incest. It's a "all but kitchen sink" mentality in writing that robs a movie of much of the credibility it needs to make us really care. That doesn't mean "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad or hateful movie. Much of what he has to say about family relationships and values ​​in the 21st century is bright, original, pointed and deep. His success is due to actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. It is they who triumph over narrative fluctuations to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris, in his direction, achieves effectively a melancholic tone throughout, but that it is often augmented by some ill-needed flashes of bold dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may look unocused and derivative at times, but its subtle performances and subtle shifts of mood make it a film worth watching.
