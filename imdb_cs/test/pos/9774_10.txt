That would have to be by far the largest series I've ever seen. I watched live every Sunday night and bought the box as soon as it was available. This is a timeless game written by a fantastic Australian that can be covered by people of all ages, whether it is Australian or not, but for those of us who are Australian, it really brings it through a typical Australian icon. And must see 10/10
