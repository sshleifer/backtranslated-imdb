Yes, I felt I was gutted after the first vision. But the next day I began to see the true brilliance of this creature. I will not repeat much of what those who appreciate the film have already said, but there's one new area I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noticed that it reflects only its cruelty and response to unsatisfactory performance. I disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student play on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying and vocalizing her fears) - just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the movie, after a girl is injured when Huppert discusses an accident with a girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, says: "We gave up everything to study the piano" and Huppert immediately snaps "Do you think everything has given up, no." So it was my idea that Huppert simply saved this young expressive student from his own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up HER, suppressed and stubborn, doomed to recital life ... gradually killing the soul in pursuit of perfection. Maybe she appeared on stage years ago before things went wrong. Maybe she wanted her to escape when she was that age. Will he destroy the student's life, or will he just free it? <br /> <br /> It made me realize that what I experienced in this film made a difference. Brilliant.
