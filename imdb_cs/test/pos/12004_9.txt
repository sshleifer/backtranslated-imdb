I felt it when I saw the episode in the original run and I still agree to watch the repetition. You were to blame the culprits of Columbo throughout the episode and treat him as Down's syndrome. And finally you see their shock when Columbo gets dead to rights and arrests them. You will also get a realistic response from arrogant preppy killers. They still couldn't give Columbo props and say he was lucky. I like the formula where the crime is complicated, the killer (s) totally underestimate Columbo, and then you realize that Columbo was a criminal. I remember the first few episodes of episodes after 1989 that didn't follow this pattern, and that was the first episode I was happy with.
