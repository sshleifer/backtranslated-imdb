This movie has improved over time. I can't believe it was forty years since I saw it at the age of 15. Yes it is true. Movie rating wasn't a reality yet so every teenager could go to any movie. Imagine how it was when I saw my age in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were just killed, but the following summer he had a man on the Moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was a chance for Woodstock to join him. See where Robert Downey, Jr. he got his sardonic brilliance. His old man was like an instant hero to children. No strikes are drawn in this classic, and the aging hippies will rejoice as they relive this era. Let us hope that the new children will be encouraged by the flowers and this current era of fascism will be subject to the same control that my era has been subjected to.
