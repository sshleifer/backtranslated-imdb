Tim Robbins made a masterpiece of directing this film. I say this because he avoided convention and clich√©. He also oversaw excellent performances by Susan Sarandon (who won the Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing is that Robbins is not sponsored. He just tells the story and lets the audience play the events. It is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own views on the death penalty, one of the most controversial topics of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in both directions. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
