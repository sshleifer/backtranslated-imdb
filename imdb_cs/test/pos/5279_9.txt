Miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 1970s and only recently has his films become American shores across Disney and fans of his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films have been somewhat more affordable for the American audience, some may find this one piece on the fence to be a species- "Japanese" in his presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is BIG "Japanese" and does not make much sense to American viewers, as are some * Ponyo elements. This should not deter you from watching this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. But what's happening is Miyazaki's very sophisticated and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy. This along with its characteristic use of character development and often the use of girls and women as the main characters. She gets out of her zone a little with Pony, the main character being a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mother while his dad is away while working on the high seas. Though not lonely, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who likes the adventure and glamor of the sea. Like Spirited Away, we see different worlds of people and sea creatures, and I feel that Miyazaki can try to alert viewers to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live under the sea and on our acceptance and thing. that differ. <br /> <br /> I was able to watch last year's headlines and was pleased with the story and conspiracy. Miyazaki claimed that "this is my last movie" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Certainly, Ponyo is a proof that Miyazaki has not revived its ideas and is still delighted, innovating and promoting the most creative animated films of all time. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and hat tip for childhood imagination and imagination, and transport the fireflies and secret shelters back to retirement rather than boring adult things and eating vegetables.
