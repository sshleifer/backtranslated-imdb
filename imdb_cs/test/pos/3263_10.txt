If you enjoyed movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barelels, you'll love two hands. It has the same type of black humor to beat, and will keep you entertained through the entire movie. Like Pulp Fiction, it also has crazy scenarios in which characters get to and how to deal with them. Together with Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, this must be one of Australia's best movies I've seen. It also plays young Heath Ledger before he got a real big in the states. This is a terribly underrated movie that I believe is as good as Pulp Fiction and the greats. You have to see it!
