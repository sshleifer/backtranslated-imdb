It happened to me that I captured it on community TV for a few years and I was pleasantly surprised at how pleasant it was. While in some ways it is a bit crazy because its main function is to be a mysterious thriller that works. great thanks to a scenario that includes a sophisticated graph; It kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired. The cast is a star-perched that contains a mix of those at the end of their career (indeed Richard Long died in the same year it was done). ), or those who were on the verge of a stellar series in the television series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). Everyone is doing a good job, except Cesare Dan, who is going through her role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
