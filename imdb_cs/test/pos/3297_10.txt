Looking at the short Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with some bitter feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I watch something that was well thought out, smoothly executed, and just bold to be interesting. On the other hand, I am lamenting above the level of comedy that is generally produced. Television and movies are so consistently charged with easy, condescending bullshit that we find ourselves in the assessment of excellence in mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis who, without the "benefit" of studio notes or a substantial budget; Can create a really cool little comic gem. Network producers and suits must contact Travis Davis to find material and stop bidding for people simply because their CV or agent may require them to. Hopefully, Boy-Next-Door got the attention of the right people to make Davis's job easier. It's really fun and very well done!
