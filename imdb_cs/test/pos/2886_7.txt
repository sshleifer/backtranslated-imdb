This is a great concert that featured the best songs of a 30 year career group. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and entertaining on stage and released a great show. As I said, I think the soundtrack was dirty on the mixer and / or via the miking process. But this is not the fault of the boys. They even mentioned that the show was set at the last minute, so the band and their crew probably did their best. They just shouldn't give a show for public consumption. Neil's snare sounds distant and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but no bottom end at all! They were going to go to this concert and wait for a better opportunity. Only buy this DVD if you are a Rushian hardcore. The quality is missing in the audio department.
