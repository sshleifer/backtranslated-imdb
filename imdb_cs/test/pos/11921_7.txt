Yes, it's not a great movie success, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and fun movie. The young cast has a great job with both the dramatic and comic aspects of the story, and I'm particularly fond of Shawn Phellan as Derek / "Yogurt". Over the years I have seen it a lot of times and I will probably see it a few more times. Don't think too much and you will love it - enjoy!
