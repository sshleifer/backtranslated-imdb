Well done document about sailboat race, common sense and loss of both. I remembered remembering how I noticed how his movie around the world when I was in high school saw his story. what was the adventure. deep water tells an equally fascinating story. It requires a special person and an excellent sailor to drive a non-stop trip around the world ... alone. This movie does a great job of proving it. I love cruising, and my brother races J-30s. but I could never achieve such a success.
