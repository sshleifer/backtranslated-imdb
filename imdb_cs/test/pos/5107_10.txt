When opened in London during the Christmas season in 1969, this musical version of the famous James Hilton story was criticized. The same income welcomed him when he opened in the US and called on MGM to withdraw his "Roadshow" status and shorten almost all his songs. What a mistake !!! Later, when the trend world of the 1960s and 1970s turned to itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is a joy. Peter O'Toole as "Chipping" gives one of his greatest performances. To watch him turn away from the hateful, cold, heartless Latin teacher at the boy's boarding school, to the man who finally sees the colors of the world (after falling and marrying the music star Catherine Briskit) is seen at work genius. (If you can, watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS back in a few days or weeks. Then you'll see what a really great actor O'Toole is, and how magnificent he is in CHIPS.) <Br / Catherine, as played by shining Petula Clark, at the height of her popularity, is sometimes a human dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a big voice to the shoe. Most of the songs are beautiful and fits perfectly into the story, while the late Herbert Ross directs the choir to life amazingly. Well, this movie may be somewhat romantic for some people, for those looking for a beautiful act, singing, and managing a love story, look no further. (If you can get into a widescreen version with a laser disc, it's even better. I'm waiting for the CHIPS debut on DVD.)
