When I rented this movie, I wasn't expecting a lot, because many independent movies seem to be a bit overrated these days (but also Hollywood movies), but this movie was fantastic, really great, it's too bad to reach a huge audience because it's just great. I really love Alice's determination, she really makes me look at my life as a gift and I see how privileged I am that I have education. But all this, this film really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what the budget is, it's a great movie and everyone should watch that they love and definitely learn something. I don't have to be stupid to know it's one of the best movies I've seen all year long, and certainly one of the truest.
