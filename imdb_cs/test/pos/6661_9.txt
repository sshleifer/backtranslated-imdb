In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in a small town with his daughter, shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) for health reasons. Ada also meets shy Inman (Jude Law) and falls in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier and his great support to stay alive is again a wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) who has survived the war to help her on her farm and become her best friend. The story alternates with current and past situations, revealing beautiful romance. I liked this movie a lot. With titles such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in supportive cast, the wonderful direction of Anthony Minghell and seven Oscar indications, this film will not disappoint. My note is that some very important scenes that are presented on DVD are removed in the story. At least one of them who shows what is happening to Sara, her child and three dead bodies in her farm should not be wiped out as it was. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Cold Mountain"
