Almost certainly the best three Stooges short with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' is as good as any of the best tria best shorts featuring Curly. Stooge memorial moments are crawling. The opening, entitled "Professor" Shemp, which gives voice lessons to domestic, unconventional and lascivious Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), followed her terrible singing notes and fought her progress. Many considered him the most naturally funny Stooges. Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a woman (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he cut off his head. when his mirror turns back. Fixing the mirror, crying with relief, "I AM? A nice image!" "Yeah," Moe quickly answers, trying to wrap her pants, "from APE!" The best scene (and perhaps the best Shemp with a trio) comes when he calls an attractive young lady. Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). She mistakenly remembered him for a long-lost "cousin Basil," striking him with hugs and kisses (which also makes the hall between Moe and Larry a merry piece), which gives him no chance to explain his true identity. Suddenly REAL calls Cousin Basil and she gets angry, pats him repeatedly and accuses him of using "poor" helpless? Defenseless? The last line comes when he is immersed in his jaw (with a real strike, according to Shemp and crew), knocking him down the door and into the hall in a perfectly made gag. "What happened, kid?" Asks Moe. "Can I help you if I'm not a cousin of Basil?" Shemp asks before release. Other classic pieces include Moe and Shemp tangled up in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, Larry slapped, because Shemp's a bad look (his face pressed against the phone glasses on the stand) and a big girl fighting in the Peace Peace Apartment. Big Emil Sitka adds his classic line (written on his tombstone), "Hold your hands, love birds" again and again when his apartment is swept away. I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as a remedy for anyone who thinks Stoog's fame ended when Curly left. It is true that Shemp did not have curls in the band, but that was due to the growing lack of support from Columbia and its (and other) advancing ages. When Shemp was healthy and the trio got decent material to work, they were still at the top of their game.
