The funniest show on TV, though humor is not for everyone. I realize it would be hard to keep the show fresh if it was going on longer, but it's a pity that only six episodes were filmed. The gags fly fast from the opening titles to the very end when you see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be in the freezer because the final credits were rolling, during which a criminal (still moving) would see all the others motionless. and try to escape. In another episode, a building began to collapse around them, as Drebin and Hocken remained in the freezing mode. Leslie Nielsen was a comic brilliance like Frank Drebin and perfect for this show? as he managed to keep his straight face through some of them, he's out of me. Because jokes and gags came so often, you can watch episodes 2 and 3 and capture things you missed for the first time. If you are like me, you can constantly watch them and still laugh. Even jokes that made no sense or seemingly had no reason for them, such as "Rex Hamilton like Abraham Lincoln," which was somehow in the opening announcement? maybe they were thrown there just for that reason. Clever Spoofing of Old Detective Quinn Martin / 70s Police Show, Police Unit Returns from a Commercial Break with "Act Two" That Appeared to Follow "Yankees One" or Some Other Quip. On opening credits, the episode title would appear on the screen, but the announcer would utter a completely different title. My favorite jokes and rows from this series are too many to do, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a boxer who has fought the lead before, "who do you think you can beat the Champ?" Boxer replies: "I can take him blindfolded!" What Drebin says: "But what if he is not blindfolded?" A minute later, referring to the small, dirty boxer's apartment, Drebin tells him, "I'll help you get out of this drain." Another thing you see is Drebin, who came across the hatch in the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken question the bombing alibi with a bombing suspect. Drebin, who didn't believe him, says, "Okay, let's just say you made the movies." After a slight pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect look at the camera and say in unison: "You made the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk freely due to lack of evidence, he blows away and yells angrily, "Tell the bomber to take off!" What else to see is a policeman giving a signal upside down to a WWII-style aircraft on the runway in front of the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes, one particularly unforgettable was: "Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Twice. We should come sooner, but your husband was not dead then." Another classic was: "I'm a locksmith" and I'm a locksmith. " When the visibly shaken father of the slave victim asks Drebin, "What can I do?" ?? Drebin, in a classic fashion spirit, reacts back, "Well, as I understand, you're in the textile business." As I said, humor is not for everyone? many people just don't get it. During the short run of the show, I remember that the reaction is very mixed. Some people thought it was totally hysterical and one of the funniest things, while others thought it was stupid and rude. For me, the police unit, even 20 years later, is the funniest thing I've ever seen on television. For younger audiences who enjoy this type of humor, but who have never seen a police team because they were too young when the series initially broadcast, I highly recommend. I found six episodes to be even more fun than the following "Naked Gun" movies.
