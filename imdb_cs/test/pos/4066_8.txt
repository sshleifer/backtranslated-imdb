The films "Buddy Cop" controlled the box office. Every summer flock of octopus Beverly Hills Cop seemed to descend to our national theaters. No longer. Recently, the dryer has dried up to barely run down. Drought has recently become a little relaxed by the release of Showtime, a film that is truly a funny and consistently entertaining example of this genre. Mitch Preston is a devoted cop. It is by no means the type of dirty Harry. Is he just an incredibly focused professional who is absolutely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of performing his duties? Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way, and falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her reality, T.V. police show. He thinks Mitch will give her "nervous" support that must be a hit, but she feels she might be too incapable of carrying the show itself. Enter Trey Sellars, a patrolman-cum-actor who has watched too many police stories re-run. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water, followed by a lot of cheerful chaos. We know that Mitch and Trey will become the best friends by the end of the movie. This is the way friends' movies get to work. In fact, it must be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the time-honored cliché, as writes Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is a high-tech McGuffin to make ball rolling (in this case an automatic rifle that fires wheels large enough to stop the tanks.) There's a smooth foreign baddy with an accent of unspecified origin. There are chases, firefights and explosions. We all know that this is happening, and we have a pretty good idea of ​​how it all goes. You know what? There's nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that worn out bases will touch, but fun is the way, not the goal. Showtime is not strenuous to be original. Instead, her energy is reflected in his characters and funny situations. As a result, Showtime does competent work with action sequences but really shines in its comedy. Robert De Niro is dry witty as Mitch. In the past, I thought that De Niro was a cool and unexpressive actor who was terribly embarrassed to be called to comedy. But recently he grew up on me. He seems to be putting more humanity into his role. Eddie Murphy is funny like Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy wasn't so talented and hit big time. Rene Russo has droll time to play motor-mouth show biz shark chase renzi. He watches a film following a high rating of Nielson with awe inspiring determination. In his zeal, he directs Mitch's life to be more camera friendly. He even calls on T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how a "more authentic" cop is. Shatner is funny, he plays exactly as we expect him to be, loud, forgotten and a little uncomfortable. I have to admit I was really looking forward to Showtime and I wasn't disappointed. Ten years ago, this movie would be a guaranteed hit. Today it is at best mild business. That's a shame, because Showtime is a lot of fun.
