Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield Indiana, I didn't expect much. I went to this movie just because I hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for laughter. Then I sat up and watched and saw why Glen Jacobs (Kane) chose Jacob Goodnight. She is probably one of the best-known guys on the big screen (in my opinion, much worse than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage for other movies that attract me to horror. This shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and scary. He feels pain, something Jason never does or does. He feels grief and pleasure, even though they both are crazy about what you notice when you see the movie. All in all, in my opinion, a different experience than many slasher, and it surprised me in several ways, as in who lived at the end.
