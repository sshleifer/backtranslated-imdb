This must be my favorite movie. The screenplay is sharp and played to the limit by outstanding Miller and fantastic Carlisle! Sharp jokes, excellent narration and no Hollywood polishing; a totally immersible film that you shot for the bad guys! Stott again stands out as a surreal chance, while Liv Tyler really beats her other, lighter performances like the excitement-hungry Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be known to you, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, watched football or saw any TV action sequence, is probably familiar with him, especially thanks to Craig Armstrong, 'Escape', who must never let him work again! The soundtrack in the first game may seem out of place in costume drama / action / comedy, but one of the shows shows it is perfectly at home when it gives a drama script. This movie is that it's not enough to see on TV! Where it is? Really delicious, crisp and elegant - you won't regret watching it - over and over again! (exits to turn on the DVD player!)
