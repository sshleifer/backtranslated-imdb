PRICE OF HONOR aka PERFORMANCE PRICE is an ambitious Western melodrama, a light on action that tries to tell an old-western version of JFK's murder. In 1881, the President travels to Dallas and is shot dead from the window while marching through the city in his carriage. Corrupt officials have murdered and have a humble slave. Our hero, serious but heartless Giuliano Gemma, aims to uncover the plot. An engaging story, bold for your subject, but fun despite the lack of filming. The movie is 7 out of 10, despite a bad DVD presentation that is too dark with bad sound. Look at a good copy.
