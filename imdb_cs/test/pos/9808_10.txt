Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find a confused ending, should appreciate the strong work of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazell, who played two young players in the film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: It doesn't make sense in the literal End. People who think the end has some meaning at other levels are divided among those who 1) thinks the younger brother was killed by the stepfather, either when Mike (the older boy) was leaving with the neighborhood gang, or flying away What he thinks the younger brother is imaginary and his flying in the car has turned into a flying machine, signaling his overcoming of the rough situation. <br /> <br /> I prefer 2). This is very meaningful when it comes to how many children are dealing with offensive situations. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his / her psyche and project of abused ones into something else; stuffed animal, even imaginary friend. In this way, it is much more felt that he is always a younger boy who is being abused and never Mike. In fact, it is unlikely that one of the two brothers would get all the abuse, even if it happened. She is also Bobby, a younger brother who is also an encouraging brother who insists they can overcome the situation. Also, the death of a real sibling life through abuse would be too appalling for an adult to turn into a fantastic end in his history.
