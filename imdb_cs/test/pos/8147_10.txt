Honestly, at first I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sexual scenes I heard that it was in it, but by actually watching the movie, I realized there were still good and sensible movies. Indeed, it is one of the most interesting movies I've ever watched. I am a bisexual teen and the film talked to me about my troubles - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. She gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these problems with the help of my self and others around me who love me who I am. Cox really did a good job of making the film by dozens of heartbreaking lines and some sexuality. That made the film more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I do not agree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama while the Latter Days is well balanced.
