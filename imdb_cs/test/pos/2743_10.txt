This is a funny and pleasant adaptation of Dr. Seuss, who is brilliantly animated with the best and well-deserved award for his academic award. Special mention should be given to excellent music score and sound effects that are an integral part of helping to make it so memorable and enjoyable cartoon. Later episodes in the series (which there were four in total) were not actually based on the original Dr Seuss material, though all but the last continued to use his familiar rhyming style. The three sequels were: Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony (1953); As of now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boing On Planet Moo (1956) - Although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr. Magoo.
