One of the many horror horror movies that came out in the early 1980s and is fortunately one of the best. Yes, it has a kitschy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was really good and really fun, even though the killer might have been a little scarier to look like a fat pet. First, we have a local sheriff or what the hell is he who warns them not to go to these mountains because they are very dangerous. But when adolescence arrives, it doesn't seem dangerous to me. It's a shame we don't have such movies anymore, and if we do, it's usually a boring horrible movie. This film relies more on tension and fright than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie that I wasn't happy with but other than it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> All of you will have to look long and hard to find this movie and if you find it, you will like it and also watch out for the last girl and the killer is not exactly what you would expect.
