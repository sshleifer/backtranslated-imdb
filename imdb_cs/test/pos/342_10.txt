I am a great supporter of Indian films, especially Malayalam and Tamil. Shame on India for not sending this film as an official entry to the Oscar. I saw this movie and clearly showed me that the Tamil adults cinema has in their script and narrative that Bollywood better catch up with. glamor and promotion. Comes to the point of what India was thinking when he sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was really a masochistic move. I think he's trying to punish the Oscar-winning boredom referees by sending Devdas because last year's jurors turned Lagaan. 'Devdas' is just a brilliantly colored but dilapidated and predictable melodrama of Love, Fate and Destiny. I'd like to stay away from it. Anyway, when we don't send a movie like Kanathil Muthital, it shows how much of the reborn Indian administration has to save them from poor managers who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many questions. They are strongly talented, but not showcased correctly.
