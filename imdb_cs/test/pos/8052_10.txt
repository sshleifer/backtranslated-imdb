I'm from Phoenix City and for the first time I saw this movie and read a book that just confirmed the stories I've heard all my life. I asked my grandfather to the crowd and told me that when he returned from fighting at the Pacific Theater, he founded the CPA company, which is known in Columbus. when he was just starting, he was asked by the crowd to do financial work for them, but he said he was gently falling. Though the FBI and the army came across Phoenix and cleared it, my grandfather wouldn't take it easy when my mom, aunt or uncle went across the river, but I assure you this is all over. the central area of ​​the Phoenix City is in need of recovery and it has slums at the courthouse where all shooting STILL OCCASIONALL takes place over angry, uneducated, low socio-economic people, and the 14th Street Phoenix-Eagle Bridge has been closed for 15 years and replaced by the newer 13th Street Bridge, but on the more fair side of the Phoenix City on summerville rd. It is very quaint and the depression depression scenery. Another incident was told to me by the family of my best high school friend who lives in nothing on the spot on hwy 165 called Holy Trinity, Alabama, which is about 28 minutes outside of Columbus, Ga. My uncle's best friend in high school was a man who went under the name of Old Man Davis. no matter how the movie goes, it's the fact that there were 3 bosses and the old man Davis was one of them ... you can even read about it in the original book. legend has it that he was so cold-blooded that he went to downtown Phoenix to make a deal with the man, but apparently the man retreated to a deal directly in front of the old man Davis, so the old man Davis went on to take off his coat cut off the shotgun and shot the man on the chest in the middle of the city in court. they say he even left nonchalantly because the crowd paid off all law enforcement officials in the city, so he had nothing to worry about. Another incident is about a bridge that another of my friends owns a rental house next door in downtown Phoenix. it is the same bridge that the crowd killed and threw the black man out, and you can even read that part in the book. I would also like to be asked to be in the film in many of the Columbus and Phoenix civilian cities. when Patterson's friend is murdered and brought to trial and convicted of the judge but is still acquitted, the judge is my father's partner in his columbus law office, which is unfortunately deceased.
