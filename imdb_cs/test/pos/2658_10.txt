I am always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called "Also the Sprat of Zarathustra", that no one (no one I have read) has noticed the parallels between the film and the famous Nietzsche's work "Also Sprat Zarathustra" . The idea of ​​rebirthing a human being into a stellar child; the child's form of indescribably more advanced being, is the explicit part of N.'s "Zarathustra"; there is a prominent arcade called "on how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which N. describes the first overman incarnation as a child, overcoming as an ascetic, altruistic side of man (a camel, always with appeal to carry more weight) and the harsh, brutal will of man (lion). The fact that a song plays in the sequence of a stellar child can hardly be a coincidence. And also Zarathustra said "man is a rope tied between beasts and overman." The structure of the film fits into this description: a brief history of a man as a beast, until it becomes a real man by mastering weapons and gaining sense, then a long sequence of man (rope as it was) and then a short look of overman. The insolvency of these transformations and the suggestion that they were caused by external forces is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra" he makes it clear that he has no idea how people will be able to enact these changes themselves, and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to "go down." the near-end psychedelic succession could be seen as Kubrick's best attempt in the 1960s to portray the mystical "going". <br /> <br /> I know these parallels are quite broad and almost certainly have been recorded elsewhere despite the fact But I wanted to mention them, but for a different reason than trying to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was finally a grim philosopher. and the unmistakable Nietzschean, the case could certainly have been made that 2001 is primarily the dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated for modern age. my tying everything with Nietzsche.
