As you can see, I loved the book so much that I used the title for my internet alias and I have been over 15 years old. (Okay, so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name, what's the limit for BBS at the time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this movie, I'd like to see it! Janet McTeer is great in everything else I've seen. I think she would make a great Prue. And even Clive Owen's function - before it was a Chancer (a great series herself). What is not love? I hope the forces that will be wise and will soon make it available on DVD! With some of the real dredgers they pour out, it's about the time when well-done production is on the market.
