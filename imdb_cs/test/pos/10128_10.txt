I normally am not a drama / feeling good movie kind of guy, but once I saw a trailer for "Radio", I couldn't resist. Not only is it a great movie, but it also has a grreat of acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. she did a great job with James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. "Radio." Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it. So for a great story, great acting and a little comedy, I give "Radio" 10 out of 10!
