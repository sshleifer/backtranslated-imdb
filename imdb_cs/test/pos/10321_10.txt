This is the first three with Shemp I saw, and it's one of my favorites! That's what I really liked about Shemp when he came back after Curly's stroke, he wasn't trying to be like Curly, it was his own character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my favorite third, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as I do. Shemp is great, it's funny, it's stupid, it's SHEMP! I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and Moe got into the stand with him to find him and they got into a mess of wires and really wrong! But what I thought was scary was when Shemp's face was broken on a glass of phone booth, looking like a distorted Professor Snape! Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that's just the typical three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things that happen to them! This short is another that has to be seen by three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
