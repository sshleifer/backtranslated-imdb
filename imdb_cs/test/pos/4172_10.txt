Symbolism galore, great tunes, this movie crushed their "soon no more" target audience expectations. These monkeys and naturally selected members of the group witnessed a gentle, but on the face, kissing each other. The report will sing today, the cage you escape from, and the bridge you want to jump from, the next generations are your own disappointments, there will always be new kids on the block to replace those who are free from the chains. The film can sometimes be frustrating, as film attack topics are so ruthlessly different from the American way of life, thinking and thinking cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of the head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want them to continue for the sake of madness. The last scene, similar to Quijot's crowd, a chivalrous brave tiger who found himself in a cage to step into the battle, is just how vague and impossible most dreams are.
