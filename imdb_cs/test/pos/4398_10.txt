I was right in the movie. I saw more Coen movies, except Raising Arizona, and I noticed that each of their films has a color. Fargo is gray-white, Lebowski is bright orange and this film is pleasantly yellow. <br /> <br /> The clear, pleasant features of this movie start now. Soon the look is accompanied by great, great music. It's an old folk sound, a kind of music that was written when music became part of everyday life. Everyone enjoyed it, chain gangs, church churches and even jailed refugees. Now, about prison refugees. I don't know what crime their characters could commit because they are a very friendly group of guys. Clooney is fantastic, his role is absolutely agile. <br /> <br /> Go as soon as possible. I believe someone can enjoy it at some level. The theater in which I was was for some reason full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You love it too, I promise. I forced myself to get to the soundtrack right away.
