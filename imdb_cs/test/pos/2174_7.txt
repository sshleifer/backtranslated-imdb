First of all, let me admit that I didn't read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I'm directing my platoon unfairly to the director and editor. My experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not as a proponent. This is definitely a movie that is worth it when you are at the end, but it is somewhat confused at the end. The Colonel was a fraud that the lawyer used for his own purposes (or for whom he was himself); or the colonel was not a fraud, but used the above-mentioned lawyer; or does a lawyer really try to serve a sincere colonel? The director and / or editor seem to have deliberately covered these questions, which doesn't seem like a Balzac realist. At the same time, the film outlines characters, if not their motives, and casts and production is excellent. This opening battle scene will have to chase dreams. However, we are still surprised that contemporary film directors prefer ambiguity over everyone else. Were the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for Yves Angel?
