I saw this film at Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters Jos√© Giovanni was awarded. It fits as a dramatic drama, Belmond and Lina Ventura's incredible performances. The attention given to each character and the complex psychological depiction of loyalty, betrayal, love and hope are great. It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent film. There with the best of Melville. (Title in English "Class of All Risks" in French "Classe tous risques" is "Classe Touriste" which means "Tourist Class").
