There are a few movies that deal with things I would consider myself an expert on, this is. After a few years of the fantasy role we played we split up, I don't leave without feeling the shame of what I did: dork. You see, these things are really canonical, that happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> You first set up the character fairly and die after the first attack. Then a little help with the constitution, and when you're up to it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charism and dexterity? This in turn frustrates the game master who doesn't know how to deal with this unbeatable gang. And after a while, players are bored, so they start to create even more exotic combinations of racing professions, no matter how ridiculous it is. I created Monk Druedain, yeah, not so far from the movie. And that is not all that should be said about the destructiveness of the self-dynamics of this diabolical game (thinking of the quest for experience points), but just watching the film, showing it all - and of course the stupidity of its most basic assumptions. Again, there is no better profession for this purpose than bard. I do not understand why bard became a figure in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is not. But once it happened, it had to be mapped into the game stream, that is, it had to be made mortal, at least indirectly. Humble entertainment never ends and rightfully ends. Sure, it's not exactly professional production, but I haven't seen a better satire of age.
