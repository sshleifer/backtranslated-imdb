What movie! I always liked the Asian style of shooting and this movie will not disappoint! Photography is breathtaking, from amazing landscapes to color swirls. The main actor is really realistic in the representation of the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The end is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only remark is that perhaps they should show a little deeper connection between his inspiration and the abuse of alcohol and women. But it's a great movie!
