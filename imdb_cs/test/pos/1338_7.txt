This film is the most traumatic and painful horror I've ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and Jeffrey Dahmer's observation (Carlo Crew) brutally kills his victims, it is enough to bring a tear to my eyes. I admit it was a low budget movie that wasn't the best, but explained why Jeffrey Dahmer is a Psycotic maniac. When he was so selfish / internally emotional, his emotions and selfishness went so deep into his brain that it made him a murderer. Everyone he brought back to his apartment, attracted him and had feelings and reasons for murdering them, wasn't just for the excitement of killing them, but because he couldn't cope with leaving him. In the scene, when he killed his first victim by attacking an object at the back of a guy's head from what I noticed, he wasn't about to kill him, but because he was destroyed with the idea of ​​being abandoned. Since then, he has gotten into murderous behavior and killed his hobbies - for both bad and emotional reasons. The scene when he was talking while he was crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house showed her love in her heart . One scene I found quite scary and strange was when the priest overheard Jeffrey in the pub and invited the guy back to his apartment and then called Jeffrey into the phone booth in the pub to lose the patience and change his mind about going to way. home with Jeffrey. When the man left the pub, the priest then hung up the phone and laughed at Jeffrey. I also found out that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold bloody facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real that I was shaking my place. His facial expressions reminded me how Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle / Leonard) in "Full Metal Jacket" looked just before he shot a general in a toilet barracks. The emotional person I wouldn't recommend you watch this movie, but if not before you go ahead and watch it.
