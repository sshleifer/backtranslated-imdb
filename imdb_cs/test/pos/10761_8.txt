Eight people who have found previous comments from FIERCE PEOPLE "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" "helpful", as well as all future site visitors who will see them before their authors remove them: these negative critics are not only shorter than those on the web , but they are completely false, nonfactual, incorrect and misinformation. For example, Blythe is a coma dad, NO dead - Maya and Finn even visit him in the hospital. Besides, it was Dwayne's yacht - NO Blythe - who knocked Jilly a maid, etc. Etc. So if you have ADD, so you can't focus on the simplest details, keep your status for yourself, not pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, add a disclaimer with your comments!
