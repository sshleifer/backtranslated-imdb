Fantastic movie Chaplin with many unforgettable moments when Charlie joins the army to fight WW 1. <br /> <br /> At first he goes to a training camp where he has to learn how to handle a rifle and how to walk in a row. This is a really fun scene because the hiker isn't used to keeping his feet straight! Another thing you know is in a trench in France. Merry scenes here include starving Charlie eating cheese from a mousetrap and reading a letter from home through one's shoulder. When Charlie goes to sleep, he discovers that his bunker is flooded and his roommate snores. This is such a funny part! I can't describe it, just watch a movie. When Charlie wakes up, she feels insensitive, so she tries to "wake up" them. When I found out that his other leg was still numb, I had to move on the floor while Charlie was actually rubbing at her roommate's leg! Then the film gets a little grim when Charlie shoots a few people. The Germans from his trench (though it is done in a very funny way) and his personification as a tree to approach the enemy, saved his friend from a deadly platoon. The last part is his getting a French girl in trouble hiding in her house. Then he must save her, while he is interested in the German emperor. To do so, he goes for a German box or something. I love it when Charlie asks for something German and it's like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way, so Charlie changes his mind: me and me! Kaiser is captured and Charlie is a hero ... but then he wakes up in the bootcamp again, it was just a sweet dream! Charlie made one of those 'dreams' before 'The Bank's coming to mind', but who cares, the movie was so funny that I laughed all the time. Chaplin also has something to say about this film (because his later work has become more of a social commentary on several of the world's misfortunes) and is best explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on earth, good will for all mankind. In short: the classic Charlie, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
