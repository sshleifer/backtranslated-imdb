I just want to emphasize (apart from the plea for the DVD series) that the show doesn't have to be realistic to be fun. These days, with all the blood and gore in the news and crime dramas, reality shows, etc., It's nice to get lost in a good, cheese show with fun characters. PWOG counts account. Was it Emma's material? No, but it was amazing as well. I also have to vote for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the one season cast. I definitely agree that the first season had more serious vibrations than the other two, but I was definitely more sucked. Although the series was out of the air this year, I will never hope to be released for purchase.
