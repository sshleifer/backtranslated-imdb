I was looking at all the doctors who episodes that my local PBS station was playing while growing up. (got introduced to the doctor through John Pertwee), as well as "camera copies" of a doctor who sent to America fans of their British counterparts. I had a great time w / show, but it never seemed to be taken seriously - I mean it seriously as a sci-fi show about time passengers could be. I went to CONS, made a costume bit (Doctor # 5,6 and Tegan was my costume character), loved it. then everything suddenly stopped. program policy and lack of interest and funding turned into a doctor who, in a 25-year-old antiquity that got into ethos. When I heard that the science fiction channel picked up a new doctor, my first thought was, "Cool, now my 11 year old son can see what I was crazy about all those years, and know what it's a damn TARDIS's "(I have a few phone booths and TARDISes of different sizes around the house) I didn't wait for the excellent quality of the story, the development of the characters af / x. At least I was pleased. for the first time I found a doctor who was not a preacher, a clown, a fop, a cruise head, a cat or a jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most believable physician he learns today, calm down the baker's fans! Don't get me wrong, I loved almost every doctor and his jokes, but Christopher gave something to a doctor he'd never had before - a real word of credibility. I'm just sad to have decided against another season. I'll try out David Tennant as I want some other doctor, but now the bar has increased ... <br /> <br /> bad rules for wolves !!!!! <br /> <br /> 2008 Update - I Love David Tennant! his "mod" persona is something my generation remembers, the generation of my son can deal with and the fashion gestapo can relax! he's a little more human than a cruiser, but not like a humas like other former doctors. I miss roses, kick martha and what does she think with donna noble!?!? it's still the best ride on TV
