He just watched this movie and it's not bad; There are several tense moments and not many long dialogue strings. It looks quite intelligent; fast, almost like a "documentary style". This film will evoke nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars, street scenes and life in the 1950s. Acting is fairly solid and it is at a good pace for 85 minutes of running. An atomic era movie enthusiast should not be missed.
