I recently saw this movie at the 3-D Hollywood Film Festival. It was in polarized 3-D (gray glasses are not red and blue) It was so fun to watch this movie with the audience, the print was excellent and 3-D perfect. The performances were at the top and it added fun, a surprising ending (that we didn't share with fellow movie go'ers, at least according to the movie trailer and poster) had people howling with laughter. According to today's standards, this is probably more comedy than horror, but with the added 3-D dimension (complete with cobwebs and screen-based bats), this film was a fun step into the horror of the 1950s.
