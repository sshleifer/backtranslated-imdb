Although not referred to as Slasher's film, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are well known for its low budget, lame fence, cheesy effects, and all you can add does not mean that it cannot be a good film slasher. "Opera" completes the description. Although it is part of the Italian gialla; which is far from the genre of slasher. Dario Argento proves that he deserves to be named one of the best directors in Horror. "Opera" is one of the most clever horror movies of the past 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful, shiny place; the situation and gore turns that are one of the scariest places ever used in horror. I think on "Opera" as a stylish Slasher, though, is in the depth of plot and character development. The cheese factor, which is often used in most of Slasher's films, is not present here, but in exchange we got a thrilling, visually stunning story. The plot of the film is simple (like every Slasher). In opera is a psycho who is somewhat obsessed with the main actress / singer and forces her to watch terrible deaths. Deadly scenes are extremely horrible and are best on film. The infamous "peep-hole" scene of death is the highlight of the film in my opinion. It's an amazing scene of death that no one else but Argento could release. A knife over the neck (and mouth) is another terrible scene, but less violent than the death of scissors. Gore in "Opera" will please evil and lovers of violence. What I didn't like about the film is lack of coherence or logic. After I looked at the first death, the chief woman, I calmed down, as if nothing had happened, that she would have returned home and not done much of what she had seen. Also, he's home alone and doesn't take precautions. Still, the tension in the film will forget you lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone has been watching her from outside, she gets frightened and sets the tension if something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is great. It's great for Italian giallo. Argento's creative POV shots are impressive. Ravens also added a haunted feeling to the film. Argento adds its unique spice. "Opera" is one of the most underrated but popular through the community of horrors for the following reasons, in my opinion: - the scene of death with peep-hole (brilliant) - raven attacks at the end - opera - knife over the neck and mouth - heavy metal score combined with Opera music (this music never scared me earlier) - killer fury <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like "Opera is heavy metal songs used in scenes It's okay to disturb the audience, but I think opera music could add a creepier feeling. "Shocking" heavy metal use is a unique disturbing aspect in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch "Opera" even if you don't There's a lot of tension and tension that could scare the most skeptical person, not "Suspiria," but he deserves to be among the best Argento.
