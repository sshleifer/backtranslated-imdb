I saw it on the cable. I liked it. That intrigued me and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good and good when he was gently scary. Cinematography is not that big, but shabby video also contributes to the sense of realism, so it's a compromise, you know? Sometimes the girl hit the accent of New England to the hard. The accent would come and go a little. Still, I thought the movie was generally well done. The storyline was strong and dramatic tension took place because you felt some mysterious secret was happening, even though things seemed ordinary. Good work on a low budget. Another good filmmaker SUNY Purchase. The way to go.
