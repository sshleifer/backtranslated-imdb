I saw this interesting movie back with a Chinese / French film "2046" at a recent Dubai festival. Both were intelligent works of the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters living in the hotel. In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a place. They both dealt with love between man and woman. Both had great music and stunning performances. What coincidence and yet how these two movies differ in treating the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the movie, the man walking down the sidewalk turned to look at the woman and hit the lamp. The audience explodes innocently into a volcano of laughter. But isn't it a short synopsis of a movie that you enjoy for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful combination of black comedy (eg, using a stethoscope to listen to a neighbor's conversation), the film follows on from what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati brought to the cinematic faces that led to a comedy in contrast to Robin Williams's equally intelligent world or pleasing Danny Kaye . The sudden insanity of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character, while the movement of money from a hotel to a bank resembles Tati's works. However, the film is not a mere comedy. The automation statement (cash counting and the reaction of the bank's employees to the statements relating to it, the manikin that acts as an ineffective warning for the speeding lady, the reference to "Moulimix" as a fictitious "company" for which it works, etc.) is several stimuli that the director offers the viewer loaded with comedy. Laughter, yes, but think about it and enjoy another .. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film lies in a brief, staccato script (director Paul Sorrentino), which offers a comedy that is mixed with philosophy ("Truth is boring "" Dad's dead, but nobody told him, "" Bad luck doesn't exist - it's the invention of losers and the poor. "You won't sleep in this lecture. <br /> <br /> Sorrentino provides entertainment that is tied to the theme which the Italians know best - the mafia, it's an existential mafia movie, "The Truth Is Boring", the director provides dessert as part of a good meal of excellent acting (Toni Servillo), good music, smart cameras (Luca Bigazzi), beautiful, mysterious actresses (Magnani, granddaughter great Anna) and a powerful script Dessert is for the viewer to see if what's in the movie is true.
