I think it's the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. He is about 40 years old Andreas, who is hit by a subway train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, but everything that was ready for him. She has a job, a house and clothes. Initially, this city appears perfect, without death, without pain and without problems. There are men in gray suits everywhere who clean and repair everything that doesn't fit into their perfect definition. However, Andreas does not really seem to fit into his old world and has long been returning to his old world. The most impressive thing about this movie is how the city looks so surreal, even though I've seen many of these real-life places that seem so remote. Another thing that greatly contributes to this is the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the bewildered and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters also do a great job of playing apathetic (sounds like hard work, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and others leads to very entertaining situations. All in all, it's a wonderful movie. The story can be a bit confusing, but the film has such a great atmosphere that I would recommend to anyone to see it. And I wouldn't recommend listening to "ccscd212" as it seems to have seen too many commercial American movies and it seems to have become too accustomed to serving morale on a silver plate. The way I see it is not much in this movie that tells us that suicide is right or wrong. I consider it a warning to which direction our company is trying. But certainly, everyone can see the movie in their own way.
