Every time I watch this movie, it really really wants me to go out and have a good night! My friend uses "weekend landed" speech to make psyche himself before leaving out! and sometimes me. This film is a great debut for writer / director - a well done partner! Acting is great, all characters are believable and bigger than life! 'Weird' scenes are a joy to watch, Jip running flash floppy / explanation / visualization are great! The scene in the huuuuuuuuu pub, when everyone stands up and starts to sing a false national anthem, is also laughing. There's a lot of comedy - Howard Marks' 'Spliff Politics' Speech is Merry! Oh, God, just see. I realize, I felt that the movie was a little celebrating the use of ecstasy, but hey, that's right, huh? At least the film does not avoid this fact. I suppose the movie also has a decent message - don't take your life seriously, sometimes you have to get your hair out. And, of course, chatting in a pub when Moff tries to explain to his friends that he is leaving drugs, is a reminder that when good times come, you know the party is over! This is sometimes a very clever movie in its use of camera, lighting, etc. It was a realized piece of cinema, and a great feeling-good story of friends, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of "rat races" !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
