This is a really sad and moving movie! It deals with the issue of child abuse. It's a really sad, but mostly true story, because it's happening every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother trying to make them home. While living with his parents, a man who likes to call himself "King" comes into their lives. He hits the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers promise not to tell their mother. But eventually he finds out that Bobby is hurt badly. The end that ruined it for me, because it's so incredible. But besides, I love the movie.
