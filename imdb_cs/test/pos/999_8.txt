From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported to the remarkable world of London's World War II. We follow the lives of four people who could be created just for this film, exploring the feminine friendship and tensions caused by marriage and infidelity. In addition to one of the characters, Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes truly despicable. This film is based on Thomas' writings on love and romance. These were adapted by a sharp screenplay by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director, John Maybury, claims that three other leading characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are very strong. Sienna Miller's wife Dylan, Keira Knightley is a cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first section of the film takes place in London during Nazi air raids, with Vera being watched by Willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. By accident, Dylan meets his first love, Vera. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three drink, William successfully breaks Vera's guard. The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and is sent to war. Vera got pregnant and returned to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There, she faces a brave existence when Vera supports Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. During these times, Vera and Caitlin's friendship are growing. So Dylan's infatuation with Vera. This gives the first test for both women. When William returns from the war, he hardly knows his wife and has no connection with his son. Things get worse as Dylan watches his friend struggle with battlefield fatigue (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes something happened between Dylan and Vera, and shoots Dylan's house in a drunken rage. "Edge Of Love" begins as a stylish romance in a war-torn London and ends in a sharp, daring life of motherhood, infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. Treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience. Some day (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great moment. Miller, when he pulls out the stitches in his head in response to her child's miscarriage of another man. Knightley and Murpy, when they finally contact their son. Hell, almost all their scenes are amazing. And Rhys, when he cleans the booth to send Vera's husband to jail. But the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman and John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or historical Thomas is, it's a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And their scenes appreciate with stunning shots. Although not the best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). He has a visual lyric that emphasizes the use of Thomas' poetry. Also, this is clearly Knightley's second best performance of her career, and perhaps Miller is the best. I've always had a weakness for the artist, be it Hulce Mozart, or Hoffman's Capote. But I was amazed at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His fighting with alcohol is well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to get his first love Vera makes him ..... a bad man. <br /> <br /> Is this the Academy Award? Of course not. At least not this year. It will be published on the state side in March 2009, which is ineligible for academies. That's 9 months after its release in Britain. Between Atonement, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the US had its fill of WW2 pieces of the British period. Very bad. This film is better than the rest, except for reconciliation. But in this, Knightley's soldier returns, but like the shell of the man who left her.
