For those who have access to the BBC or CBC, it has proven spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show rebuilt from the ground up. But in the case of Dr. Whoa saved the best parts. I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... that's the best Doctor Who. It has no cheap production value and sometimes a slow dragging old show. Acting is pretty good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily equal to the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former QAF leader) seems to have made smaller figures that come to life. I know ... I'm blasting. but this should be on every sci-fi geeks list. I just don't know why she didn't do it here. Whatever you do, if you ever loved dr. Who or sci-fi .. this!
