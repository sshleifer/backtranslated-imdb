Like many other people, I was attracted by the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well made film and a careful transcription of old material. At the hearing that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. It immediately seemed to be a harder story to the film. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little humor and the author makes numerous abbreviations to focus on his main theme: that, because everyone would see the other as the only one who shares the unique combination of loss and betrayal he has brought in a plane crash would they were quite surprised to find each other's adulterers. Moreover, he imagines that the distinction could come as a bitter examination of the hidden lives of adulterers, so that this "fat and thin" experience could bring deeper love than before. Although much of this book deals with their bitterness and their hatred of their former partners, there is acceptance and forgiveness at the end. The film scenario retains only the air crash and the spouses' common distress. Where a woman is a research aggressor in a book, she's a man in a movie and a woman is never a willing co-investigator. The film has a brand new dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford, which seems even more refined than a double coincidence. The female "congressman" is also new to the woman, but she works better. An audience of pure romance or romantic comedy expectations cannot be met because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. Where resolution and forgiveness is attained in the book, but the reader's burden of bitterness is abolished, and the Levity is allowed, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness never suggests, we have the impression that healing after shooting has a double duty. Ford's character does not have to be caught in a few words, and Scott's-Thomas's accent has changed a little worrying at first. This film is not a dead loss suggested by others. However, it is a difficult movie that you will appreciate because overwriting and adapting to the screen is under the standard of a director.
