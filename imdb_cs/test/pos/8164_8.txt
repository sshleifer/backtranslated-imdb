Four holy young men from the Mormon Land go to L.A to preach the gospel to the city's pagans. However, one of the young Mormons is a suppressed gay who "becomes" the Way of the Cross with the very "young" boy of L.A. (What would be film charts without chance?). These two, very different, young men become friends, and in this process they influence the mutual view, which in turn creates an inevitable clash between homosexual and Mormon cultures. This is the premise of "" Latter Days ", a 2003 film, written and directed by C. Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film is of course very important, especially in contemporary America. It is necessary to tell the variations of this story and reformulate and reformulate, hopefully, in future films ... because the basic theme brings to light the hate-superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists too often display towards gays. "Latter Days" is provocative in nature and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, even though the script is intelligent, sensitive and insightful.
