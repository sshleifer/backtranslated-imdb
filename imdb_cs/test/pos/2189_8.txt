Well, I'm not the biggest fan of Sondheim in the world, so even though I have an album that I cast, and I've listened to it several times, I've never seen this show and I haven't even seen a movie version of Tim Burton. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful to see Burton and give him a chance just like a movie. This version is not a movie at all, it's a movie game with some of the original cast members, including Angela Lansbury's most important performances as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a channel to the heart of Broadway magic and the theater itself. So much fun had to do with this role. Sweeney Todd himself does not play Len Cariou, who originally did, but George Hearn. Hearn has a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou, but it seems to play a little wider. The only problem I had with Johann Betsy Joslyn's character is to some extent her lover Anthony played Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice can't withstand the high notes, but I wasn't quite sure if it was the right point, because I didn't understand the game. More importantly, I'm not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really holds enough weight to keep some of the music, but fortunately the whole thing doesn't seem to be taken too seriously by its creators. As a lark and a little comedy in the style of "Grand Guignol" it is quite pleasant. I do not feel that it is such a major work as "Society" and "Do the Forests" or some of his other exhibitions. Some music is quite spectacular, but at other points it seems to be out in the world off the show. I'm not going to say much about it because it's a movie website and it's not really a movie, it's just a movie that was filmed. There were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where the camera moved around, but that was it. People want to see it because it preserves the legendary performance of Lansbury, which deserves its legendary status because it is a hilarious and keen performance. George Hearn also boasts his version of Sweeney. That would be a good movie that would show children over 5 years old to be interested in musicals because it is blood and cannibalism really surprises. When I saw the show so professionally and so faithfully, I wanted more effort to be made over the years with this musical theater, as I prefer shows from the 20s to the 1950s to these later periods. "Sweeney Todd" is an exceptional show from his era however, miles and miles over the AL Webber insanity.
