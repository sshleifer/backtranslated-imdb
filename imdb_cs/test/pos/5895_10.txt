Thirty years before this film came this film, an excellent meditation on the effects of war on the American family, as seen by war heroes and their wives. The truly ironic title of THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE is something, but since these times have disappeared into images and all that remains is an uncertain future for all involved. Billing Myrny Loy, BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE focuses more on men's stories. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons grew, although he found support from his loving wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, after returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and imprisoned in a marriage that Marie, a happy girl who wants more out of life and who hates him more and more. . Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems because of the loss of hands in the war and feels that the whole world - including the girl he loves and her family - thinks to be a madman of nature. For almost three hours of length, the movie never seems to be long and pulled out. There is so much emotion going on even in small moments that the breeze conspires; nothing seems unnecessary or placed on the screen due to lack of editing. Not powerful rings false, though standouts are those of Dany Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Mary Derry. Even then each character has his moment on the film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American movies (including those made around World War One that did not dabble on such topics). While there is never obvious violence, it's all there, in the scary face of the three senior men, in the lot where the planes are now set, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore forgetfulness) in cynicism by shop owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these - Shocked men who saw the battle, or worse, to keep them wondering what it was worth. It is a movie in which COMING HOME and BORN are entered on JULY JULY. At a time when America escaped from war movies to come up with this, when the end of World War II was still fresh, it was a necessity for film production to become more honest.
