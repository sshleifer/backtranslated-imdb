What do you do when you go out of a blockbuster movie like "Devdas" with Aishwarya Rai, with some skeptical criticisms still unwillingly dissatisfied with his overwhelming performance or convinced of his strong presence on the screen and the star acting skills you do? Go home, sit down and grab? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you will sign another strong season to come and continue to prove that he is worthy of all praise, kudos, great scenarios and equally great roles. And that's exactly what she did with and in 'Chokher Bali - Passion Game', where stars and shines like Binodini, a young widow who causes a controversial journey before her time. Directed by: Rituparno Ghosh {who later continues to direct her in the same stellar 'Raincoat'}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali} costars.
