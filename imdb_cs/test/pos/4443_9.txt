This early film from the future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at all. Add a number of giallo movie fans to the mix? madwoman, journalist, inefficient police, sexy siren, priest, muted girl, mentally retarded loner, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70s. Young boys are the victims in this case unusually for giallo, making a change from more typical women at risk. The fact that they are children who are the target of a maniac serves only to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci is wrapping around the envelope a little bit and goes even further in the wonderfully outrageous unPC scene, where the young boy is exposed to somewhat awkward attention from the sexy naked young woman (Barbara Bouchet), whose job is to serve a drink. He exposes himself openly and actively calls on the young man to loathe her; he finally asked if he wanted to go to bed with her. Even though he plays with him clearly, it's still a pretty unusual scene. It is true that there is one or two unintentionally funny pieces of dialogue, but it is very nicely photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes a high level of self-confident sex-applause. Standout scene. Even if you felt a little bad and watched it! Together with Barbara Bouchet, Florinda Bolkan is the next standout, playing a madman who is accused of murdering children. She is not directly responsible, but it is up to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not discard the subsequent deadly spree. Apart from being hunted by a crowd of lynches and a chain whisker, the car radio explodes rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. Her cruelty suggests that Fulci's career path should go. Despite the visceral influence of the above-mentioned murder, it may be a bit surprising that other murders are either bloodless or off-screen. The only other deadly scene comparable to a lynch-crowd is the extinction of the murderer at the end of the movie, though this sequence is a bit silly. The plot is convoluted and flooded with red sequences, although I personally found the killer's identity a bit predictable. This weakness is less problematic in the following views? Like most gialli, Don't Torture And Duckling is absolutely re-watchable. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well made with an impressive camera, a solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani? especially good is the recurring female vocals unaccompanied, which sounds as if they come from a distant hill. Fulci apparently made more graphically violent horror movies, but here he shows talent for somewhat more restrained material. It's still wild stuff, and is highly recommended for giallo cinema fans.
