I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm impressed. When the show was over, I felt that too many questions remained unanswered. This film seemed to me to close. To see all the people I met in the last few years, it was finally the most beneficial. I heard it's probably the only killing movie we can expect. If so, it's a good way to go out. This film is sometimes annoying, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you are or have been a fan of the show, check out this movie.
