Did I catch this movie about the most likely success? , from the lower league, the football team. The plot is thick and rolls some big fatness. Intercut with footage and commentary from the 1970s was taken aback by his shear foot entertainment. Great cast includes excellent Tim Healy as a crazy (drunk) manager groping for something his team will win ...? I still remember pieces like the stolen secret file that Don Revie (Super Leeds United and England manager-beloved fans hated everyone else) has at Bostock United (underrated men) who in their opposition report, Bostock United, in this finale FA Cup, just says "Sh-te". Lots of other footy gags long before the fantastic feature length "Mike Basset - Football Manager" starring Ricky Tomlinson. Up there with Gung Ho English footballers. Although the score says something else, "Escape to Victory" (still cheering when England scores) And ungrateful eternal grind to follow really bad team at Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon" from "Ripping Yarns" "(with Terry Jones) the team was named Bostonworth United, if you're interested. <br /> <br /> I looked high and low for a copy of Bostock's cup, even Nick Hancock's biography is not a list of it (probably someone - not mr hancocks - bug) <br /> <br /> Play again or sell me a copy - please.
