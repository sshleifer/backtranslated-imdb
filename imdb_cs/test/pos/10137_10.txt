EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Should have won an Oscar for his portrayal in this movie! It was a movie! While the film is missing in some areas, Cuba was amazing ... and for me it's the best role it has ever played! The scene in the movie, where he finds out that his mother has died, has broken me up and cried IN THEATER !! I think I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people like my own school that grew up ... what a tragedy! Knowing the "real" radio and coach at the end of the movie was also very special! If you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need to check your heart! If you like "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you'll love "Radio" too! I wish they did more movies like this ... Radio is a Real Deal!
