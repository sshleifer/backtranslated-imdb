Being 15 alone I enjoyed this movie in the afternoon !! I related to the character of Ann August more than most of them. My mother is not eccentric like Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This movie is perfect in all aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so connected that it's best on the dual screen I've seen in years. Their chemistry brings life to life, becoming real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone who hopes to get away. Because there are a lot of people in the world who would like to be "anywhere but here", including me! And if you can, check out this movie with your best friend or your mother. His tears that connect all around you more!
