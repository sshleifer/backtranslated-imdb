NVA combines eastalgia-humor, military comedy, and teenage film. Though it is typically a typical German movie as sentimental, I think it's a great and very funny movie. You will not just laugh at the NVA, but also get a glimpse of East Germany's armed forces from the late 1980s and how young recruits and professional soldiers have experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Party. You'll like NVA if you like Sonnenallee (another movie directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin, who is much more serious and less obviously entertaining. Negotiation is acceptable. But watch out for former Frank Kim singer who has only two facial expressions: a natural and shocked saucer!
