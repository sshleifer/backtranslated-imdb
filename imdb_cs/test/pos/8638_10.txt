With an introductory segment that mimics Todd Haynes Safe's music and cinematography (1995), David Lynch uses the dream, myth, and distorted notions of reality to tell the broken story of failed Hollywood actress / waitress Diane Selwyn by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes is dedicated to director Hotshot Adam Kesher. The film takes place effectively in Diana's Drug Head; we are witnessing her crazy distortions, her wishes of fulfillment, regret, obsession and fear. Using the dream story as a way of presenting two concepts of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify opposition between reality and imagination, but entangles them actively. The last 45 minutes is like a dream like what came before; and the unpleasant air of separate, ambiguous, ambiguous ambiguities still pervades, breaking the seemingly safe difference between reality and dream we expect in films about nightmares and dreams. Lynch's film borrows many films, both old and new, but in the end, unlike others, the film owns Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. He constantly calls the viewer to interpret what is visible, not only intuitively, but also intellectually. But it is not as fitting as one would imagine, because Lynch makes us sympathetic to the protagonist despite her murderous acts - an element that was missing in all his other films except Straight Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a healthy Canadian farmer for glory. Lynch also presents an interesting story that confirms and negates to the same extent. Are Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who's the blue lady? What does it mean? Who's behind Winkies? What is the significance of the rotting corpse on Sierra Bonita? Is there really aunt Ruth? Is silencio an abstraction of hell, or perhaps even a confident takeover of the film as a fiction? Lynch is not ready to answer any question he poses, instead of presenting his "love story in the dream city" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs. Acting is the highest measure, especially Naomi Watts as Diane Selwyn / Betty, who is to make this performance even more eclipsed. Laura Harring has the necessary appeal of Hayworthesque as Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings into his role free arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression. It was an overwhelming and serious injustice that neither was nominated for an Oscar. It is a film that requires it to be carefully analyzed and analyzed. The secret at the heart of the film remains in Lynch's hands, but half of the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming discrepancies he presents. On closer inspection, there is some sense of puzzle, perhaps an incomplete puzzle that irritates us by closing, but denies the imaginary fullness of narrative coherence. Finally, this is Lynch's key film.
