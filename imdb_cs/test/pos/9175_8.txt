Chick swings that guys still love - Yes! Great. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl and don't feel like I can't wait for the movie to end! Light - but funny. Great stuff. What ever you want to miss DVD add-ons. This great "blind day" file too. Will Smith do well - even if he is in light acting - it all goes well. The movie is a bit slower - don't expect too much action - laughter is there - so it's a message - but the timing is a bit slow. Use low moments to whisper or kiss - it rises. The end makes a good feeling that is worth it. Most of all, enjoy the fun light fares - and watch some great encouragement of the actors - they make the movie. Plots are predictable - but it's a data move, so take out popcorn cartridges from the kitchen - and don't make it stop. Count on other dates after this movie - it will want to see what's next in line. Don't forget Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
