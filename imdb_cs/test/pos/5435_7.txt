Robin Williams shows his stand-up talent and strengthens his comic status in this movie, "What's a Bad American Policy and How Hollywood Can Try to Affect Without Boring People". Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or non-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like stand-up and political debate. And the trailers of this movie were for everyone, just to make sure that as many people would see it. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than bush & what, so they have to make these movies every now and then ... but this may have been too obvious, at least I thought I made some real change. Still, great stand-ups and fresh political questions and interviews ... I liked it and thanks to the IMDb.com rating I was positively surprised when I came out of the cinema and yes, I was many times he laughed. Sometimes you just have to let go and forget all the seriousness .... check out this movie if you like good and clever stand-up or politics and you won't be offended by a few links about how things aren't good now. Rent it if it doesn't match you.
