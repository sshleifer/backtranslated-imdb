This film overcame the previous mile incarnation, and everything went to the next level. As always, Jackssu boys are purely incredible, and I laughed at the theater personally before I had long. Just like the first JackAss, it's not so much a movie as an eighty minute long series of bits and jokes. It is pure circus entertainment at the highest level. Basically, these boys are clowns who get rid of themselves. And his great. Shenanigans are so low, outrageous and often disgusted that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment. You can't rate this on other movies, in your own class. And shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle it is.
