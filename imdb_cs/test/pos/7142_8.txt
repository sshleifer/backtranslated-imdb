The 1990s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly showered with praise and I enjoyed it very much, but this TV original is just as good and in some ways more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not brash Joy, but she is still confident and throws her cap on her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). Quiet, Quieter and Less Emotional It can be Attenborough's movie, but it's just what's a wonderful game full of meaningful dialogue. You will still cry for this version, but you may not have a musical challenge to knock you out. There's room for both of them - and when I saw it on stage, I'd say Ackland / Bloom is a bit more faithful. But both are excellent.
