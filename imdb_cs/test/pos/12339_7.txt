A bunch of girls make a new promise to spend the night in a haunted mausoleum. Of course, the recently deceased will not be left dead for a long time and all hell will be released. "One Dark Night" is a pleasant horror of the 80s with some gruesome corpses moving around and controlled by the spirit of dead psychic Raymar. no gore and nudity, but the mausoleum atmosphere is very scary. The actor is solid, but the script takes too much time to build up the characters until the last 20 minutes, when Raymar finally breaks out of his grave. The Mausoleum is a great place for highlights. The film lasts as long as it gets and that is its main mistake.
