It must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really gifted. He has a gift for humor. I almost died laughing. Actually, when I saw it in theaters, I was thinking of leaving because the film was so stupid. But it's stupid. It's funny. And that's a really good combination. You will laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This mockumentary film style follows a series of characters from all competitors at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and tons more. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie that will make everyone laugh. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is presented in widescreen view to give an image that you are viewing a real documentary, and this is probably what adds to the merriment. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
