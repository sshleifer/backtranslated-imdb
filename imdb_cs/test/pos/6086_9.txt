It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see the "English patient" again after the death of Anthony Minghella. Most of his work is devoted to one broken point. The endless moral struggle of those who consciously walk a very thin line. In "Talented Mr. Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith Amoral Tom Ripley to a murderer of conscience. In "Breaking and Entering" Minghella gives Jude Law the character of the need to confess and the rewards tremble. Here, in "The English Patient", characters in love are never too far away from their corrupt guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They tear down their characters from every pretense in compelling participation with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, simply put, magnificent, and her scenes with beautiful Naveen Andrews are filled with the sensual innocence of "Minghellian". Anthony Minghella gave us films that were one way or another that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was faithful to himself, but he was thinking about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying our own. There's something clear, honest and surprising about Minghell's opus. I'm missing, but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left.
