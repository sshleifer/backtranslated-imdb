This movie is definitely one of the best of its kind. An age story about love and gravel. The depth of his story is the one that will upset the vast majority of the emotions of love and hatred, with some very interesting twists, a film not only for the lesbian audience, but for all viewers. I can't say more or spoil the experience for a new, young audience that could just be out. Another great job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way to win Sally Hawkins over the audience, who have a brief look at her talent in another work by Sarah Waters, in "Tipping the Velvet".
