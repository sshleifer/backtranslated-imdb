Despite the very low budget, "Sorte Zero" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I have to say that well-deserved success. What I love about "Sorte Zero" is a lot of details that Fernando Fragata went to see what's happening and what's next. It's a very detailed and greatly advanced for a seemingly simple love story-off-bad thriller. Even more fun and ironic is that the characters are in the same situation, neither of them knows the whole story and is left to their own preconditions to "Sorte Zero" surpass the rest. This is definitely not a movie on which you would like to go for a bathroom break, because you will undoubtedly miss something important. I feel that one of the main attributes of a movie should be the environment it creates. It's scary, but cheerful. I've read somewhere who quotes this movie by saying, "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I couldn't agree more !! I love movies like this, where you have to pay attention to everyone in order to fully understand what's going on. 9/10
