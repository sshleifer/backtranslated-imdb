Forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as a book. So what? It's just a movie. It's a pleasure you can watch, exclusively on site in Cephallonia, wonderful photos, but also dark, distracting moments. The only problem I have is with the obvious mistake of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. The film was a very pleasant surprise.
