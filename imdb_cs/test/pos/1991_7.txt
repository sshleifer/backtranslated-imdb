"We both stumbled together in this unreal world, whose rules and goals are largely unknown, seemingly incomprehensible, or even non-existent, always on the verge of killing by forces we don't understand." Ted says Ted Pikul in the movie. Which sums up life for some people and "eXistenZ" is probably a film about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how you say it. Or not. The last line of the movie is brilliantly ambiguous. The film looks like a hairy dog ​​story (it really has a real shaggy dog), but it takes you on an interesting ride full of provocative Cronenberg touches you to watch amphibians, pods, fish, spines and bones in a new light. Some pieces are pretty icky. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called "GAS STATION" and the Chinese restaurant is called "CHINESE RESTAURANT". The film has a stunning structure that is far from its usual large sci-fi films. Many things in the movie and it sleeps watching more than once. The main players are Jude Law, who is fine and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is great. Some roles do not suit this very talented actor, but when he has such a good role, he is incomparable. Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of Allegra. (It looks great even in a short black skirt.) There are other well-known actors, but they're not much dedicated to them. It looks good, sounds good and the Howard Shore score completes the movie very well. Cronenberg is perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's genre of science fiction / horror. No matter what the film does, it's always worth watching.
