Dan Dailey gives a sincere and varied performance as the great Dizzy Dean. His handling of the character is a very true life and captures the taste of Dean's background and limited education. The film obviously centers around Dizzy Deans to rise to fame and his sudden trip to seclusion with the injuries he decided to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is beautifully portrayed by Joanna Dru, who gives a woman who has loved and supported players who have so quickly turned into "dizzying height", a high quality country. The depiction of Dizzy's later career as a sportsman is sincere and unwavering, reflecting his problems as a result of his poor education and his colorful language in the air and beyond. Dizzy was quite a character, and Daily breathed life into his story with admirable skill. If you like this movie, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953), in which Daily plays a downward and carefree ball player who adored his young son (Billy Chapin). Once again, she materializes players who are completely satisfied. I highly recommend the Pride of St. Louis fans of baseball everywhere.
