I like the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was excited to watch as much as Satya and society. New Jatin also lived according to his role and Nana Patekar was at the best. Suchak was really irritating, but I think he fits the character he plays - he had really nasty teeth. The story has great progress and no songs in the movie make it better. I just want Urmila to join his other films. I think they're the best director and actress I've seen. I haven't seen Naacha yet, but I'm looking forward to it. For some reason, I won't find Antrum Maali who could watch the screen - unlike Urmila.
