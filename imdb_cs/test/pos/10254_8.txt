... instead, watch it as the great advent of an age story about African American men in the mid-1960s in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you who are under the age of 50, "What's Happening" was a light, totally unpredictable sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) for a group of young African-American high school students living in the neighborhood working class. I liked it a lot - she has no real relationship with this film. "Cooley High" started as the basis for "What is a Happening", but his serious nature did not register well with the test audience, so it was redesigned as a comedy, even though the credits for "What's Happening" still read that was based on this film. This film begins with light, but touches on many aspects of life that are unique to the tumultuous sixties and some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. Boys deal with sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness, and even premature death. The end is pretty strong and serious and the movie has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to play on premium cable channels and was not considered old enough to be considered a classic film and played in several places for these films.
