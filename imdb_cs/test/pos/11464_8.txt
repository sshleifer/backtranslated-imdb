Demon Night is a great movie and an excellent example of how good a low budget can be. Sure, most of it is quite predictable, but somehow it is even more enjoyable than the bullshit we see these days as "horror". I give gore a fixed 9 and the monolayer daemon is actually funny. I still crawled out "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is great, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There is also some very nice T&A on display as well as some hella good makeup effects. The second movie in the series is also pretty good, but avoid the inferior third. Demon night can be dated, dark and low, but still has great potential. It's definitely worth renting at least. Give it a chance tonight, stay away from some old makeup! (you will understand when you see it!)
