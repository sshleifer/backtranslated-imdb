This movie was cheerful! Sometimes it went too far, but isn't it what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and ooooooed on all the incredibly crazy pieces. It is rude, rude and sometimes frighteningly intense. The whole gang is back and even more of their minds, which in turn provides great fun. I don't want to give up, but small pieces of clips over the net are nothing compared to what's coming. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie you can see with friends. Try to see it with a big crowd. You won't be disappointed. He just doesn't go with anyone who can't take it (see above). It won't be good, you can be sure of it. But that is obvious in the first place. If you enjoyed the first one, you will be this loooooove.
