I was impressed by this movie. Then I didn't want to see any movies for a long time - any other movie would be so unsatisfactory in comparison. For many it may be the worst of Antonion - a very slow, non-engaging conventional story, a microscopic examination of human emotions and interactions - and the worst of Wendersverbos, confused transcendentalism. It consists of short, distinct episodes associated with a typical Wenders meandering heroic stream of consciousness, so it does not create a temporary forgetfulness of escapist cinema. But for fans it is the best and the best. The Incoherent Story is a drawing of one poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments looking for the heart of things. <br /> <br />
