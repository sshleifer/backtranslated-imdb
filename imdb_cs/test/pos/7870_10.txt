This is the most active and entertaining ten minute movie I've seen for a long time. As a film student at NYU, where this short film was screened several times, I greeted Jim Cox as his "amazing sense of style and pace for our generation." I'm sure I'll see his name later on the big screen. Hopefully this short> will find TV on TV or somewhere, so this inspiring work can get a broad distribution that it desires
