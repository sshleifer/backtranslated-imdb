De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as they say in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a favorite butcher. They are full of criticism of their bosses and decide to start their own business. Their business is expensive and has no electricity everywhere. And to make matters worse, they have no customers (as predicted by their former boss). When you pay them a visit to the store, they ask them to give him the meat for the dinner he organizes. Then a tragic accident happens. One of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezer chamber when he closes the store. The man dies and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut out the electrician's thigh fillets, and instead of calling the police, he serves it for dinner. It's an incredible success. Suddenly every person in the village wants to taste the incredible "chicken". Amazed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no other choice but to kill more people who can sell like chicken. I think everyone may not like the subject of cannibalism, especially because it's a lot of humor. I personally liked it very much. This perfectly shows how far some people go for some social acceptance and get out of isolation. It may sound a bit far, but I'm sure you'd be surprised how people sometimes act in real life. <br /> <br /> Besides the original theme, I was also pleased with the actors. performance and humor. There is no overclocking, as you might expect with this kind of movie, it's all very sober and realistic (I think it's typical of Scandinavian and Scandinavian movies). Same for humor. I'm sure I wouldn't like it as much as now if humor was up, or there was a lot of bursting, vomiting, ... as often as in American movies. I loved this movie and gave it 8/10.
