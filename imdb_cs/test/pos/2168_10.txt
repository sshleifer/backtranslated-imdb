Black Scorpion is a fun movie about groovy female super hero who wears leather tights and drives a car she can turn into her light armored Scorpion Mobile. She is fighting the evil Breathtaker and all this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved a little about having to say "Yo" to get the car's orders! Breathtaker is so bad he wants to give the whole city asthma! It's all upstairs and it's beauty! A scene where Black Scorpion "attacks" his partner steals the show. You'll know when you see it. This DVD also has a fun conversation with Joan Severance. It's a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. He loved it!
