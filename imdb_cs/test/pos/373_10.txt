One of the three biggest films by Alfred Hitchcock, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps," Strangers On A Train, is as brilliantly out of control as the carousel in Metcalf and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie that's so fun that you can't even feel guilty until you have time to breathe. Best amateur tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) an extremely strange, louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on the train. Thanks to gossip sites, Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his poor wife Miriam, and somewhat cheerfully suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno kills Miriam and Guy kills Bruno's father who wants to put Bruno in the institution. Guy laughs, but Bruno is not joking about how Guy learns about his danger. It's a great prerequisite for a murderous story and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for all its worth, with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock movie, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against grain, Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either swaying old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What does Bruno manage? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality has found a match in handsome Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up an old gay gift, but Guy seems to be quite happy with the departure of love with Anne Morton's sociality (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy could be just as easily addicted because someone who would make a mark in the world when he lives at home, let his mom put her nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people doing things," Bruno growls, looks like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important." Later, Bruno is called "bum", quite accurate, except for our entrenched interest in him, even when Guy's life is troubled with his murderous interference. It's the ultimate perverse story. Bruno is his sense of integrity, his persecuted dedication that values ​​our respect and which Hitchcock plays so well. When Bruno floats from his great crime, am I the only sick person in this world who is actually happy for him? I don't think so, but Hitchcock keeps the story on the right track to realize how low we've fallen. We don't want Bruno to win, exactly, but we look forward to his enthusiasm when he tries. Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough to make every shot unforgettable. Hitchcock has always mastered at least 2-3 good sequences on film; Here you get the score in the amusement park itself. ("20 Big Shows", the neon side at the entrance says they're not kidding.) The screenplay, camera work, breathtaking tennis match, Ruth Roman's character that falls into his jaws is too big to contain one movie. Even Granger here has a youthful thing with a much more aggressive credibility than Gregory Peck ever did. You can call it a movie clinic, but the "clinic" sounds too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is a good nasty fun all the way, so you realize with a shabby stinger on your tail that you have taken the wrong stranger all the time. Damn, I'll take the ride again in a second!
