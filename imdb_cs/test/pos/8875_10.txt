This movie is immensely funny - Mom always returns me to the movie! I can't get enough of her dry lines ... like telling her son Owen to bury her friend in the yard before she smells ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts! It's merry! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck or Planes, Trains & Automobiles, it's similar to humor. It's a great, healthy laugh ... you have to see!
