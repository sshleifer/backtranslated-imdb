As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel like I can answer some of the questions and the confusion that has been put forward. I think I am also able to offer some insight into the club and back stories. Oh, and this will be a long post, I can tell. First of all, people who said the movie doesn't show real rugby have a valid point. The film is full of bad fights, people in the wrong places and much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game is, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But the thing is that something that would actually sit and watch the light disc or jumps into the game would not be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Indeed, how many sports movies will you really feel like in the game? Not much I've seen. I think it's important to remember that the film is about rugby players, much more about rugby. Haka is much more part of the Highland Rugby. It's not something they just throw in the movie. To be honest, I don't know how tradition began, but Highland mimics all blacks in many ways. Also, the uniform is located outside the All Blacks. The film didn't do a good job explaining the origin of Haka, and being honest, I don't think that's right. But I can tell you that every team member knows exactly where he came from and what it means. As for a person from China (?) Who said only Maori can play Haka, I would suggest they look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a good portion of them like and play rugby for local teams. I'm myself Hawaiian. Whenever possible, Haka is led by Maori. This will not do it because they think they are Maori, they do it because of some of the problems that appear in the film. The concept of unity and "those who have already gone" is a huge part of human culture and the message behind Haka, for all those who are familiar with it, it supports these values. It is a chant from a boss who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those who support him tell him that he will live (Ka Ora) and encourage him. It's a good idea to make a game of white boys not for me to say it, but that's the ideology behind it and why it's done. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used team motto, although the actors had a hard word to say. in fact, they didn't observe Highland in this movie. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really good at what they do and are quite respected in the international community. It is true that some years produce better teams than others (that's what you would expect with any sports team), but you don't play record HR results just by being fine. A year after I graduated, (1998) Highland was one of the 12 teams that will be invited to the World Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were manually picked up from around the world and at that time represented the best of the high school rugby talents. Of course, Highland did not win first place (New Zealand did it) but managed to finish third in the tournament and beat Tongan National Champions in their final match. And while American rugby never reaches the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, the third in the world is nothing to hang your head. Highland also has a tradition of touring New Zealand every few years, and usually returns with more victories than losses. Most of the characters depicted in this movie are based outside real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and among the four of us we were pretty sure we were able to identify ALL the main characters. Nobody knew white Rasta. Of course, it wasn't a documentary, Hollywood took some freedom, but told you the truth, not as much as you think. The film was actually quite accurate in showing 2 and a half hours of daily practice, as well as mandatory personal run and strength training. Sometimes it really ran until you jumped. It also showed services and other team activities (like the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were very much part of the team's bonding. And finally, the movie, in my (of course very biased) opinion It was a pretty good movie. And I think the reason is that I watched it as an inspiring sports film. I didn't think it would be a pure rugby film or an award-winning drama academy. It was just an uplifting film about the rugby team, complete with morale, encouragement, and a good deal of jokes that were good for fun. I hope I've been dealing with some of the issues people have with the film, and I hope you can enjoy it for what it was. Kia Kaha
