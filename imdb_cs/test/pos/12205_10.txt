I'm sorry that SURFACE wasn't picked up for the NBC 2006-2007 season. I think the market demand for audience games and real estate programs on television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has taken a good story. I hope and pray that a network will pick it up, so it will continue as STARGATE does and it is a spin-off. I also hope that manufacturers will find a place where they can produce Post Production, in an interview with the TV guide. Right now, they'll have to do the Sci-Fi rununes, marathons. I'd like to see where the story takes place after the tsunami that ended the 15th episode. I would like to find out who is the master of effective efforts to confuse the true identity of creation. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
