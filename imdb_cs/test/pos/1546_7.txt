Recently released on the UK DVD, this is a good movie (if you have attention span and IQ more than a fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could be, it's a kitchen sink in its dirtiest condition. Terrance Stamp is great, music is sweet, Carol White is very trustworthy as the only mom who can't stop loving a criminal. My favorite scene is where Carol and her boyfriend, who works in a pub with her (the one with a huge hive haircut that descends over one eye) sits outside and gossip about all the men who go around. The only thing that messed up was Carolina's first wife, but if you can do it, you're OK. And Donovan provides some of the weakest, soft, bitter texts that came out of the sixties.
