Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in theaters! I can't begin to describe how amazing they are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary films should look like and look like. This film is about a young boy, Alejandro "But" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in one small loft room at the auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York (which I didn't even know existed - Willits Points), where there are endless junkyards and body shops. Here, Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to buy and prepare for food delivery. But he makes money in a garage and Izzie helps in food delivery; however, both earn extra money on the side. But it sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts; Izzie leads for sale. Their lives are surrounded by grains and grim, but even though they are both witnesses, living and barely surviving in their harsh world, their love for themselves is never tainted by the filth that surrounds them. And sometimes they are able to laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood that they have stolen from the fact that they are trying to survive and stay together. The best comparison I have for the Chop Shop is that Bahrani's juxtaposition of innocent love among family members against such a dreary atmosphere is as strong as Pasolini's Mama Roma combined with growing up too fast in the harsh environment anyway like in Bresson's Mouchette. They have co-written, directed and edited both this film and its first, Man Push Cart (which won the award worldwide), Bahrani is a total film director. I can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!
