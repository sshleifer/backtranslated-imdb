I'm not the biggest fan of Westerns. My two personal favorites are Unforgiven and Tombstone. But I loved this movie! It was great! The story was great and it was a fun movie. Anyone who has contributed to this film has had excellent results! I even think they both beat the movies. Well, not really forgiven because it was a great movie that these two can't compare in the long run. But I think it's overcome by Tombstone. They both had strengths. For example, both had excellent known castings, very good graphs and very good filming. But Posse beat Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better at Posse. The idea was original in Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, action sequences! Oh my God! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really well! The action was quick. As well as a modern daily shoot'em up movies. The event also had large budget outbursts! Fistfights were also quite good. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I recommend buying this great movie!
