The detective story isn't typical of the Matrix Universe. It is a film noir-esque private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feeling. Rich in its visual appeal. It snows the scene, the grain, it all stuns the eye. But what about the story? It's interesting, even if it feels a little off. Agents hire a private detective to trace Trinity. They will find out that they have tried this approach before, but with dangerous consequences for hired detectives. Yet he tries to find her and eventually succeeds through Alice in Wonderland links and hackers and chat rooms. Then things get interested ... <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a perfectly satisfying short animated movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
