This small image succeeds where many large images fail. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not bothered by the studio's big wigs. He was happier with this film than anyone else because he did. He was also able to use his repertoire of talented character actors who played such an important role in his past achievements. Some of them such as Ben Johnson were discovered by Ford and gave the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually made his own stunt work. A few years later he won the prestigious Oscar for great performance in "The Last Picture Show". Ward Bond even surpasses Ben Johnson in this film. He is not the car's leader, this role is played by Johnson, but because of this film he was later given the role of champion leader in the classic television series "Wagon Train." TV series "Gunsmoke" on a competitive network "Wagon Train". Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons targeting the West who often backslides to his sinful days by cussing only to be called down by fellow Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When an unpleasant situation occurs, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts, "Blow your horn, Sister Ledeyard!" Sister Mormon, played to perfection by Jane Darwell, then blows so hard and loud that even the devil had to be shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in the classic Ford version of John Steinbeck's novel "Grapes of Wrath." Another of Ford's greatest actors is Hank Worden, who plays one of the notorious Uncle Shiloha Clegg, but not too bright son of outlaws. Worden would become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's "The Searchers". Worden lived up to 91. He still made movies when he died. Car Master Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse traders who never take their job seriously, a lot of fun on the road, especially with the local sheriff. They mix with the Mormon train heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the movie. The main reason for collaboration is the redheaded Mormon beauty Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley), who catches Sandy's eye. On the way the train picks up hoochie coochie show, which includes a quack doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). On the way is also the Clegg family, which is intended for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult the road west of the car was in those days. The songs in the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones' writing was almost as good as Bob Nolan, who had done a lot of songs for the band before. Jones' most famous song, not in this movie, is much recorded by "Ghost Riders in the Sky". The sons of the pioneers are singing in the "Wagon Master". This contributes to the overall impact of cars to the West. It should also be noted that the acclaimed Native American athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of leader of the Navajo. That was his last film look. He died long after the "Wagon Master" was released.
