I really like this movie. I like it not only because it's a great 80's movie with a great soundtrack, but I've found it has some provocative moments. It's just moments; not the whole movie. This is definitely not "Less than Zero". <br /> <br /> Scenes deal with typical mutual pressure as well as more difficult issues like betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters. Some scenes stand out and invite you to think about their own teenage experiences and how these experiences can affect the character and outlook of an adult. <br /> <br /> You can watch and think about the challenges facing young adults. and their own experiences. Or you can only pay attention to the boys' desire to get rid of viruses! :) Either way, it's a good movie.
