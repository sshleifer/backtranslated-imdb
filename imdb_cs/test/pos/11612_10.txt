When you waited for years to see the movie you heard about vine, your expectations are obviously high right? f ** to yeah, but when that kid fell into my door a little i knew what f *** ed up visual would be the grace of my television and the distortion of my fragile mind. First, Karim Hussein is a movie fan like we all grow up on a diet of Argento / Fulci / lynch etc ..... and that shows in this movie, but in a good way. Although I didn't know what the hell was going on on my first watches about this gem, I was impressed by the visuals, lighting and of course the performances of everyone that Karim had participated in. to push the boundaries of filmmaking (which I believe) and to have hard work to persuade actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about "subconscious cruelty" ? Well, without spoiling ... his deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual insanity that fits into madness ..... a truly memorable experience ..... .. <br /> <br /> watch you closely on Karim Hussein, who can only do better things ..... <br /> <br /> On a two-disc DVD, I viewed the full print of the subconscious cruelty of Infliction movies that are loaded with add-ons. ... please note that there is a censored Hong Kong version that avoids this version.
