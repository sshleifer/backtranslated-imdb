Really scary movie. Happening across curmudgeon James Kunstler's praise led me to recently-formed web journals like Life After an Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin, and Oil Drum, and data behind the Hubbert Top Theory. Like this film, LATOC and Kunstler paint a grim picture of extinction or ejection. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005 gasoline prices, rising oil prices, Chevron Will You Join Us, BP become Beyond Petroleum, and even T Boone Pickens believe in the idea that we are at or near the top . oil production. After extensive research on scarce data, the oil investment banker, Matt Simmons, suggested that the Saudis would no longer be able to increase production in their huge but aging areas. Due to increased demand (mainly from the US and China), the Saudis did not respond with higher production despite previous assurances. This world production of 2000 and 2004 shows that a light, sweet raw material has actually peaked. which means that refining will be more costly. The film seems to focus on baby boomers, but younger people, our children, also need to understand the implications of an energy-depleted future.
