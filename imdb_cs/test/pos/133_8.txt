WARNING: SPOILER! Don't read on if you're ready for some spoilers. I think this movie had a lot under its shell. In addition to the seeming connection with "Oldboy" (and other Park-wook movies), the incestuous relationship and the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampires, physical actions, really disturbed me in this person. The main actor, Kang Ho Song, is amazing in the role of Sang-hyeon priest - coincidentally, "sung" means "blood" in some languages ​​- who really loved Tae-ju, played OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in the "Badlands" where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around his finger. Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is completely different. While moving, she is stiff, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, saying she doesn't move, or blinking her eye. Park-wook really made his movie this film, and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; There are plenty of beautiful shots in the whole movie, some for simple effects and some that require a few glances and probably repetitive views to fully capture them. Music is quite a stock that uses mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it is a very good thing that the character is as downloaded as it is. While he does very little and loses it, he seems to be the one who thinks a lot instead. While his love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind him. In my humble opinion. All in all, a very disturbing film that is not created for an action that is not in the same size as most of the things about vampires today; it is spectacular and at the same time repellent.
