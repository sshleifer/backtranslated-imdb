Coen strikes again. I had no preconditions and I was impressed by the bizarre story of a good evil guy story. Although Clooney is easily removable in this, its Cornball style is welcome. Turturro and Nelson are dead ringers. I loved "I'm a man of constant sorrow" as "Soggy Bottom Boys" do. Smart melody ... <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
