This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think a lot of people are trapped in Leland's obvious mental illness as a plot, but I was drawn into the relationships of many characters and what they reveal about the power of human emotions. Much of the movie's message is that we never know good without bad, which is a little clich√©, but what makes this film so good and so original is that it eloquently portrays the overwhelming and destructive power that evil can have. Whether you see bad everywhere, like Leland, or you're experiencing utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just won't work no matter how bad you want. This film captures how helpless relationships and emotions can feel better than any movie I've seen and it's like a depressing film as good as it is.
