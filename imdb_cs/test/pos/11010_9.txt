SF space is not unique (although it was a lot at the time), but its focus is completely different than in other artificial films. Particularly in the first part, this is a sophisticated picture of crime, which uses the SF premise to tell an unusual criminal story in which a forced detective tries to solve the mystery of an obstacle to vanishing characters and useless witnesses who may not lie to be useless. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. In the second part, we follow the main character's struggle for common sense and turn into a psychological survey of character in an extreme situation. Does he know that his own existence is nothing more than electrical impulses, how to deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something essential about a world that no one else knows or wants to believe is very real with which many of us can identify. For me, the film very well transfers this hopelessness, with its harsh, artificial atmosphere, which also supports the de facto artificiality of the film world. In addition to the "Matrix" or "Thirteenth Floor", it's little enough to evoke a sense of respect for his artificial plot conspiracy, but instead focuses a lot on psychological aspects. The philosophy is so interesting that some philosophical concepts are necessary for how they shape and change the world 's perception of the world. It is probably longer than it has to be (which is not a problem if you are as biased as I was) and part 2 runs a little on the pair.
