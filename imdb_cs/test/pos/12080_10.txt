I watched this movie many years ago on TV and recorded it from there. It was because I was so young at the time. I was just sitting and watching this movie again, now I have 2 own children and I had to try to fight back tears, but it didn't happen that I was crying over most of the movie. when you have your own children! Such a wonderful family, such a heartbreaking movie really amazing! Someone said that about 8 live even more news you are all still in contact I would like to know! The film touched the whole movie!
