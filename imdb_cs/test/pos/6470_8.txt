Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to the more conservative "On the Waterfront" by Elia Kazan. While the "Waterfront" benefits immensely from the electrifying Marlon Brand, who unintentionally disguised the Kazakh attacking theme, which seeks to justify the nomination of names (as Kazan eagerly before the House Un-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City" boasts young John Cassavetes and upstart Sidney Poitier dared to confront the problems that the Waterfront could not recognize, namely workers' rights and racial relations. "The Edge of the City" jumps courageously into this (then) unknown territory, and although the pretty attractive black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit of a Hollywood simplistic, courageous fight against lean fanatics and violence barely aged. One wonders how shocked the early 1957 viewers were on such a bold presentation of the relationship between white black (if some of the bigot games didn't leave the theater early, they have to be polite if they're not offended). The last film reel will still be a surprise to viewers because it refuses to sink into the expected clich√©s, including those that have "Waterfront". Only the most endangered viewers do not realize what a radical and entertaining movie "Edge of the City" is ending. <br /> <br /> What is most worrying about this lost classic: as unfortunately not available in any format, the reasons that remain relatively cloudy. This film should be required to browse high school or college history across the country, but one can only find it on obscure late night television, if at all.
