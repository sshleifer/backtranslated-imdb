I love Ernest goes to jail. It's one of my top 3 Ernest movies. Others are Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest goes to camp. In this film, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a bank janitor, but wants to be a bank clerk. He is soon assigned a jury duty, but soon finds himself in trouble when the evil killer Felix Nash (Varney also) knocks him down and switches places! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act as Nash, otherwise Nash kills Charlotte Ernest's love. Taking Ernest to an electric chair and thinking he is Nash, he gets so electrically that he breaks and leaves and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with funny scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh! He still does it to me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job of a good guy, so bad! Varney was like his star Toy Story Tom Tom Hanks. No matter what role their roles play, they are memorabilia and that is one of the things Varney will remember forever! R.I.P. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing life to Ernest and other fantastic characters! 10 out of 10!
