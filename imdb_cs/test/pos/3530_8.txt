September 29, 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my horror. This was the date BBC1 aired (the only time I knew) Jeff Lieberman's super-creepy 1981 Shocker Just Before Dawn, and it made a huge impression on me. Almost twenty years later I am pleased to announce that I have finally gotten my hands on a special edition of the two-disc Shriek Show / Media Blasters, and it's just as scary and disturbing as I remember, if not more. Br /> <br /> As usual with genre films (and that was Lieberman's first film as a "director for rent", although at least he removed all the religious cult serpent-mumbo-jumbo from the script), it's a bit thin - Five sympathetic twenty-year-olds (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a pair of uncomfortably tight white steps) embark on dense forests in Oregon to make camping instead and try out the land that would have been one of their numbers. But before dawn, it stands out from the crowd of imitators, because Lieberman does not waste time showing us how things on this mountain footbridge are in place, with a full innocent skewer and a drunken preacher stuck down the hill and flooded in flames inside. the beginning of the film. The chicks are plunging into the image in the clever Winnebago, Blondie's Heart of Glass, which sets out on the soundtrack, and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"! An innocent stag dug the front bumper and had the first aggro taste of a heavy maniac responsible for the opening disaster. Forest Keeper Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things are likely to break if they keep going, but they are still on the road, refusing to give a bright preacher a ride, even though he is ruthlessly afraid and finally set off for a campsite. from anywhere. Needless to say, it goes downhill from here. Although this film is not short on bloody horror and well-designed action scenes, there are special moments when Lieberman allows his camera to zoom out. Slowly, from the apparently innocuous shots of funny kids who kiss in the wild, or just settle down for dense, imposing forests. The Oregon looks as terrifying and as ominous as Kubrick made the spacious interiors of the Overlook in vibrant colors, and Brad Fiedel's score (discounting the terribly distorted rocket that runs through the titles) remains on the right side of the intrusive, underlining, slowly growing threat with gentleness and emotion. There's a lot of surprise on the way, nods at Deliverance with the discovery of the girls from their grandfathers and her strange, disturbing family, and a really bizarre killing technique that was deployed shortly before the end of the film. I don't want to mess it up. I said enough. Quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult point instead of a runaway strike, it is hard to figure out, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years. come - it deserves to be.
