I enjoyed it. Here you are, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it several times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this waste like Die Hard 4, which keeps the box office and get critical recognition just because you have an old American rescuing guy. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age (47 I think), bringing kicks that reminds Kickboxer. If you like old school events and explosions, this is a movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. The movies Van Damme and Steven Seagal go to the theater where I live so I never miss the chance to watch our old action stars on the big screen.
