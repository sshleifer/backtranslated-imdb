This review includes MILD SPOILERS, but not enough to spoil the story ... I watched Nihon Chinbots (Sinking of Japan or Japan Sinks, depending on where you live) recently. the same name that was based on the best-selling novel Sakyo Komatsu. This film is a jewel of Japanese filmmaking. Japan seems to sink due to the subduction of the tectonic plate to the west. Americans predict that this will happen in 40 years, but according to Dr.Tokokoro (seemingly "crazy" scientist) it will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so convinced, but is preparing an evacuation disaster plan to form a new D1 team that can handle the crisis. While on the road to China to negotiate evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed, and sends the cabinet to a state of panic. The D1 team is tasked with managing most of the issues and is led by Saoro Takamori, a newly elected Minister of Crisis (former wife of Dr.Tadokoro). Instead, he turns to Dr. Tadokoro and intends to throw astronomically huge holes under Japan to avert the sinking process. Japan would soon have to deal with different countries and persuade them to accept Japanese refugees. Soon, it seems that many countries are reluctant to accept more because of the sudden influx of Japanese in their country and the subsequent chaos (if it ever happens, touchwood, I hope Ito Misaki will be safe ...) can always stay in my place. hee hee. Evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the catastrophe, suffering and despair faced by civilians in such disastrous times. And many faces of man, arrogance, selfishness, bribery, bravery, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well made film. The narrative is solid, with an engaging story and wonderful acting. Dr. Tadokoro (played by Toyokawa Etsushi) was done really well, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and bashs things. His frustrations and fears were very visible and that is a really good thing. Reiko (played by the gorgeous Shibasaki Kou) was also played quite well, and has the most memorable line throughout the movie (go watch it to find out) and I'm glad she has a nice acting voice. She plays the interest love of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi SMAP). I almost forgot ... has really, really long hair ~ And there is also a gentle but background love story that is well written and if there is something that the Japanese do really well, they are love stories ... <br / One thing that makes this movie interesting is a technical explanation of the events that happen, and if you're interested in geography, you'll have a really good time (I know I'm ... hehe). I see that they went to great lengths to make this film theory believe, and the first few graphical displays and explanations were done quite well (though you'll have to excuse the famous Japanese "Engrish". <br /> <br /> OK, now about the effects (It's all about the effects, isn't it?) After watching the movie with pure astonishment, I have to say that this movie has special effects that are on par (or even better) with some Hollywood: volcanic eruptions ... massive earthquakes ... destruction ... tsunami ... explosions ... it all did beautiful, the opening scene is so cool, the first earthquake will surprise you, the mountains will fall, the destruction due to the volcanic eruption makes the cringe ... really watch Mount Fuji warm up is a miracle ... You see Shibuya fall to the ground ... it's so sad! However, what I felt was one of the best scenes was the huge tsunami scene that sees that rescue operations are failing and people are leaving with no one to have them. ct ... The last scene deserves a mention ... wonderful things. If you like the effects you will love this film. Oh yeah ... every good movie has a great song behind him. Seriously addictive "Keep Holding U" sung by super-cute and adorable SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it's just beautiful. I feel that it suits the film and shows that no matter what disasters hit us, our love and strength would keep us. Disaster scenes are handled with orchestral music and sometimes silence (Japanese specialty) and actually give a sense of chaos destruction on screen. Oh, and did I mention it's really, really, really a WIDE screen? Oklo, you're going on and about this movie. Yeah, I loved it and I was hoping to be able to watch it again ... It's a conspiracy, but it's all excusable because it was just an amazing movie from popcorn. It's not perfect, but really well done. I'd give him 9 out of 10. I'm glad that the most expensive film in Japanese history is also one of their best. If you haven't seen it, you should today ... It's MUST WATCH!
