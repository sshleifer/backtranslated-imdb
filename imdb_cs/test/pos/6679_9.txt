This is a movie that lets you think, is it or not? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives viewers room to think and interpret them from the label. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very healthy. First there is a conspiracy. One day Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman from the muggers, she is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) Hospital. Prot talks freely about how he came from K-Pax, and is here to report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked in a low security department. It brings other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can take one person with him. Dr. Powell soon begins to ask Prot's insanity, and as the story goes on, it's harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. Dr. Finally, Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a clever man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot says he plans to go to K-Pax exactly on the fifth anniversary of the murders. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prota or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and has never been found. To my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Proto. On one of his previous visits to Proto on Earth, Robert was a child who learned about his father's constellation. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family and Robert killed the killer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but hurrying back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes Robert's thinking to say his body. A moment later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he goes to K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but has to leave Robert's body. That's why we now have Katatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanation or Guidance: <br /> <br /> PROT'S PLANET KNOWLEDGE LIBRA NEAR: As Prot says, every child knows about his own system. Few people on Earth have learned about the system and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter was smart and familiar with his constellations, but he wasn't an astro-physicist. DR POWELL FEELS PROT: It's true. Prot could leave the institute at any time, but not too much. Last words of Proto Dr. Powell is, "Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him." Apparently he stayed there to secure Robert's place where he left. SUPER-HUMAN SKILLS: Prot has been shown to have significantly higher sunlight sensitivity and even to see UV light. Prot provides his usual reason for K-Pax, but no ground reason has been given. It was also mentioned that Protu was given extremely high doses of the drug without effect. USING PATIENTS: During the movie, you see Prot to help other patients (or patients who discuss Prota's suggestions). a better mental world. While the psychologist refuses to help Proto, Dr. At the end of the film, Powell talks about new lives that patients lead. SPRINKLER's SCENE: Sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is the irony where Roswell is). Does Porter associate a sprinkler with the death of his family? Is he trying to protect Powell's daughter from this terrible fate? I have a different opinion. Porter is thought to have committed suicide in the river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I believe Prot combines danger with water, not sprinkler. He tries to protect the girl from watery death, as Robert did. HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can reveal Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives a lot of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and declares K-Pax's homeland. <br /> <br /> SECURITY CAMERA: Why should the camera be released for any obvious reason? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to travel north. Funny, patients aren't terrified at all. She really tries to calm the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than staff. Of course, Bess, the winner of the essay competition, is the most prominent disappearance. Not only will she disappear in the approximate same time, but her only remaining guide is her winning essay. This is just my humble theory. You can close what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory that Prot was the only person Robert Porter took on himself to mentally defend himself against reality, but that would give up too many holes.
