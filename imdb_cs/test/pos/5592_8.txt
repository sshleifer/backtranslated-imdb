I felt the film was before his time. One potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted, and was diplomatic, but firmly set to entrust the charge. The mother's role played very well (you just hated her). Her need to control her son's life was neurotic. If you've ever been in a relationship where you were tried and found they were missing (and everyone knew about it), it might go too close to home. It's been a few years since I saw this film and I remember that this plot and dialogue would work in the 50's or 60's. It's hard to watch because of the dynamics of mother and sons, but I'd like to watch it again. I still hope to find him on one of the old movie channels, but so far no luck. Attempts to purchase were also futile (I don't believe it's on tape or DVD).
