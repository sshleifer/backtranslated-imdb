I can't understand the need to jump back and forth on the scene, and skip the plot. I think someone who has the skill before using it offends our intelligence. She starts to feel a little fancy, and as if trying to be so vague for the first three series. A little disappointment with this episode. Besides, using past quirks like Locke's ability to know when the storm will end is sincerely insulting ... we had ooh and arr, or laughing at the softer side of Locke? This episode was everywhere.
