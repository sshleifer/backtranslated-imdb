I found that this film is educational, fun and very mobile. I was amazed to learn how much Arbor Justice had contributed during his time in Kosovo. Wendy Crewson is highly regarded and good to see her in Canadian production again. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City). While the story of this film may not be entirely factual, I was left with a desire to learn more about Arbor. Great movie for inspirational young women. I say the movie is "must see".
