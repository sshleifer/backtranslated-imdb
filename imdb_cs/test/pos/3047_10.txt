This movie has launched my theory on book-based movies: Instead of following the clich√© "You've read a book, now you see a movie," if you're looking for a good book to read, try the one you like the movie. based because it will be 10 times better. I saw this film on its initial release at the National Theater in Eugene, and I liked it so much that I saw it again. It is the perfect combination of one of my favorite actors' inspiring talents, Jon Voight, with what has become my favorite book "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. I can't imagine anything better about the nobility of learning and the ironic challenges of life. Two small objections: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers from severe pan-and-scan damage and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the title of the book, a reference to one of the strangest, mysterious songs ever written.
