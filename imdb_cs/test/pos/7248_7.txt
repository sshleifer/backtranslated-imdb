Anyone who has seen this movie trailer would be forgiven for not having this movie out of comedy. In fact, it's hilarious, though not too funny, rowing a couple of highways. There are numerous mistakes in the movie. The script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely boring. In spite of all this, it is quite pleasant, mainly thanks to two leading Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two great actors, especially Carlyle, are always good to watch and there is good chemistry between them. Director Jake Scott is the next generation of a family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us films like Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and recently GI Jane and the enemy of the state. His debut is directed by energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film fizzling along, though without the strong cast he has collected the results possibly not working as well. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an easy-to-enjoy movie to go through an hour and a half then you could do much worse than Plunkett and Macleane. On the other hand, if you want something gentle, historically accurate and provocative thinking, go somewhere else. 7/10.
