Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse became the core of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first cartoon ever to have Mickey, it's actually his third, but it doesn't matter. The story sees Mickey, who pilots the steamer until Captain Pete takes him out of the bridge, stops to pick up the cargo, and Minnie Mouse misses the ship. Being picked up by the drops of her musical leaves and the goat eats them, Mickey helps her handles it's tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to make percussion until Pete comes back to stop him so Mickey peel the potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on the 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on the 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!
