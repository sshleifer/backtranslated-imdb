The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies I really enjoyed. Subjects and acting were far above the usual Hollywood class these days (and still is). For a while, however, she produced smaller studios producing films about adolescents that did not diminish or soften children. The men dragging the strings for this production were from your Cannon friends. Three teenage friends trying to lose their virginity when they are still in high school. They make someone or anything to achieve their dream goal. Sensitive from the group (Andrew Monsoon), what to find the right girl, while his two best friends take everything they can. One day the child finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate will play one of their bad tricks. His best friend is moving on and sweeping her off his feet. After knocking her, a sensitive child helps the girl return to her feet and pay for her abortion. She still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, his best friend has a very violent fall out as her dream girl overtaken. Yet he tries to love him. The night comes when he asks her a question. But his heart is broken when he sees him dancing with his former best friend. In tears, the child leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed on this movie was that it wasn't striking. Instead of being filled with false situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The film is full of witty moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this film to fans of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
