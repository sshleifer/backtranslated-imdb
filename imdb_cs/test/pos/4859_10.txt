This film contains a blow. There are several that make me think deeply and disturb me a lot. I saw myself in the same trouble - passively allowing things to happen around me, not worth the right thing, just trying to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid wave formation or neck sticking? How often our inaction justifies the evil deeds of others. We would never join them, we say, we realize that what they do is bad, but do we do something about it? Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a poor-quality clerk who has paid off his home in Brooklyn, New York when World War II was lost. He seldom engages in what is happening around him, never marries, seldom socializes, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his very "white" little neighborhood pulls him out of his self-service shell into a series of events. It starts as he witnesses from the bedroom window rape of Puerto Rican girls son of his neighbor. Soon after he gets his glasses for bad vision. As he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. One bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue his normal. Then, despite his credentials as the Presbyterian WASP, he will be caught by the pernicious anti-Semitism on that street. When things go further out of control, they find they have to make an important decision - they take a stand or just leave. think of yourself and what you really stand for. Postwar anti-Semitism is here, but there is injustice at all times. It is up to the individual to decide where they stand.
