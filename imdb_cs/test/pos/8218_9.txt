If you're actually reading this review, I'm giving you a lot of credit. You care to ensure that this movie, which most people have forgotten, makes sure that you read what's behind the first reviews! So for your reading pleasure ... <br /> <br /> I assume you already know the plot line so I won't waste time typing this text. Let me mention that Sandra Bullock has done a great job with this movie. Indeed, it has brought a lot of sympathy for the role of computer programmer, which is often difficult. I can say because I happen to be a computer programmer. Anyway, I thought the basic story was very good. You can easily create sub-parcels on its mainframe and turn them into a very enjoyable movie. The assumption is also realistically realistic in that it can all happen if the right precautions are not taken. <br /> <br /> To see a short time ... oops! Too late! If you like Sandra Bullock brings the role to life and you want to see a very well done movie on time, check out this little gemstone. You won't be disappointed. :-)
