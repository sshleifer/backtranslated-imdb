George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eat" is a prototype for most of the 'slip' fiction and camp surrealism that is so neat now. Really innovative, maverick, and just spectacular brilliant. Hyper-weird acting, gently frightening atmosphere. I recommend reading a book by Stephen Thrower "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available from FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: A Bed That Eat" and "Beyond Dream Door" make a perfect double-bill. In addition, it is complete and tired - and finally stupidly ironic - to criticize the low-budget cult film for being "badly made" or "technically inept". The aesthetics of film B is part of the magic of these films. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect of "The Bed of Death: The Bed That Eat" has an advanced floor on the viewer.
