I give him 8 out of 10 because he is a cult classic. It is also run by the legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. Listening to a recent blogtalkradio show called AARF Show (Robert Morgan's co-founder) says that because it has become such a cult classic and does well in film conventions and so on, there are plans to continue this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed up and hopes to have a few more. Robert is a good man and I hope he will do well. He devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a researcher to Sassquatch (who is also one of my interests) and author. Look at his show for paranormal and maybe in the near future you may look at Blood Stalkers II.
