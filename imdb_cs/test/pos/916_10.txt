"Rouge" is part of the trilogy, but it stands on its own. It is not a continuation of any kind. The end, which I will not reveal, connects these three films together, but if the other two do not see it, it is not too confusing. This film amazes me because it is so reserve, so gentle and simple, but it is as effective, emotionally and intellectually as any spectacular spectacle or melodrama with stars. Here, Kieslowski explores random and fatal phenomena. Both themes are loosely woven in the story. The film is very ridiculous, but the message is very straightforward: Everything is happening for some reason. Love is in all our destiny until we open it. The title, "red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "fraternity", or fraternity. The color dominates the visuals of the film. I tend to think of it as love or passion, or the blood of life. It's great when the movie allows freedom to do it;)
