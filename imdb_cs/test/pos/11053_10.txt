Garbo's first spoken words electrified the audience in this 1930 movie and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo became a star in her first American movie, Torrent, in 1926. And viewers waited for this movie to see if Garbo could go to interviews. She did it. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banks and Renee Adoree fell on the sidelines for their accents, Garbo set out for the next decade. Despite the stiffness of this movie, Garbo is truly excellent, especially in the opening scene with the same size of Maria Dressler as Martha. Two big stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as each other size while having a few drinks and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Garbo was 25; Dressler was 60. Charles Bickford is fine as Matt and George F. Marion is good as Old Chris. Marion created this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in a 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet. This game by Eugen O'Neill is a real classic, but surprisingly it has never been re-recorded. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the rigidity of the film and the grimness of the story, it is really a miracle. Check out this for Garbo and Dressler!
