It took me years to finally grab this gem of the film and it was worth a wait. Almost in all his films, Clint always plays a hero. Be it a hero, an anti-hero or a vengeful hero. In this movie, he is a pure villain and plays well. As a wounded union soldier, students and teachers bring him to the school of Confederate girls. Soon after she starts to seduce the ladies regardless of their age and some are quite young. It also plays their jealousy and opposes each other. In the end, you are never so happy that Clint dies a terrible death. This is what makes this movie a gem. Clint had never done anything like that, and after seeing the film, he wished. He plays the role of a villain so well that you will wonder why he has never made any other movies. It also explains why the film is not seen very often. Most people don't want to see Clint as a villain and Dirty Harry was released shortly after this movie became a hidden gem. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, you owe him to see this movie. You may not like what you see, but you won't forget it soon.
