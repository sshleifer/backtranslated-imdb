Jack Black and Kyle Gass team together support their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D in Pick of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own rock opera .. that was like Opera Rock 'N' Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie .... a big foot ... a mushroom section ... and finally, when they made a rock against the devil. A classic character in Tenacious D .... one of the best movies I've ever seen. The last few things I saw in the theater were stupid. That really made me laugh. The whole is Jack Black, whose goal is to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and a man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magical selection that very horrible musicians can play. Eventually they get to the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the selection. On the way they meet The Stranger played by Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner catches a pick and all the time he was a devil and he fights D in Rock Off. D doesn't win, but the devil's horn falls and sends him back to hell. Proto LONG LIVE THE D !!!!!!!!!!
