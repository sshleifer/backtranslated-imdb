I read a book in a summer book club and we all loved it. My friends at this club have agreed not to watch the movie so that the book is not destroyed. I disagreed and recently watched him with my younger brother and parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very true to the book, without losing its own spirit. The theme of the "new boy" has been shown so much that we've learned about it, but that's not what the story is about. Acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but it was still good and the kids had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the storyline was cute and not too exaggerated. It was a children's film that works well for adults or teenagers. I'd like Beatrice to have a little bit of a girl's attitude, but it was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was quite as much as I imagined him, except that his hair was apparently colored, with blond hair and dark brows. Roy worked very well as a little boy and a new boy, especially interacting with his parents and friends. Message and End (which I will not talk about differently than I do) Make a great stimulating film on a rainy day. All in all, it was a great movie that you can watch again and again whenever you need to remember that the world is not terrible after all.
