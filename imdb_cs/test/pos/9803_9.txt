This movie was the heart-felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood, and the little things that shaped Tom Hank's. Using a very mysterious story, they were able to give you an idea of ​​what really happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. And while scenes like a flying machine may never have happened, it helped show how denial can help tell the truth. In good conscience, I couldn't rate it lower than 9 out of 10, the great performances of all the actors, and while many may not have understood the mysterious ending in which a brother is murdered by his step father and Tom Hanks covers using a far-drawn story of a flying machine, devoting a great deal Attention to small details like a turtle he still has, even though his brother "flew" with him. Really, a beautiful piece of cinema, and every actor deserves credit for it.
