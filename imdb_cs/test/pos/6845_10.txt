What's wrong with you? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? TOO Quirky? Knocking Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for Fun Playing Against Type? And someone liked gingerbread men? <br /> <br /> I rented it so I didn't know anything about it, and I found it a handy video that can be found. Never offensive, thoughtful, funny, scary. I disagree with the naysayers clearly. I thought the story itself is remarkable, but the great cast that most likely the director pays attention to him in a super cool condition. Good sound design also (much more appreciated in surround but I'm not bragged). And yes, I am a girl, so maybe she has a slight female inclination (the guys in the gang pay off). All in all, 9 and cordial RECOMMENDED.
