Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, living in this burned old hotel where eight refugees are going to be cleaned. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best. I still thought the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the girl eats hungry dogs. The Best Must Have Been When He Put A Cell Phone Into The Mouth Of Blonde Girl. Kane was a really great horror actor, this serious look had a whole movie and would never change. That was his only look at the whole movie. Great action and killing scenes, I don't think I could give her a total of 10 out of 10, but 6 seems good.
