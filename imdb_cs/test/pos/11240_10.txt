There are too many people on this record who have apparently missed the gentle joke of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it's a cheerful parody of myself. Guys who are self-proclaimed buttons are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction skills until they "hit the box" just to reveal their complete lack of "play" on national TV? it is totally cheerful and the guys who are truly qualified are extremely convincing to watch as hopelessly their wives who often visit these fashionable nightclubs! It celebrates a unique charism when it deserves and ridicules the delusional douchebags when it deserves it. Either way, it's always fun because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly captures the authentic embarrassment and excitement of the "pickup". I highly recommend this show to anyone who has a sense of humor.
