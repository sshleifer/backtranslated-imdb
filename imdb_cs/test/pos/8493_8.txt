Let's get the error out of the way right now - the movie should be much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man who led a difficult and challenging life. There was simply no way to get it all - or even touch them all - in a standard movie. Since the creators of this film have done admirable (and I'm sure pretty agonizing) work to put together a film that couldn't tell the whole story, but managed to release a representative sample of the man and his music. Ray Charles's strengths were apparent throughout the film, and his weaknesses were neither reinforced nor covered with sugar. We could have wished for another hour to watch his life after 1980, but I think it would tend to turn the film into homage, and at the same time it would allow a few things to end, the balance I think it was better as presented. Now for a big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? Wife and I saw countless movies in our years, but we immediately agreed that we never saw a performance the same as Jamie Foxx. The line between the actor and the character was not blurred - but rather it disappeared completely. We heard a lot of humbug before we saw the movie, but this was mysterious. Foxx was Ray Charles. You weren't watching a movie feeling like you watched Foxx do a great job of portraying Ray Charles - you watched him believe or understood you were watching Ray himself. I don't know how else. We were completely blown away. I admit that we did not see all the other performances for the Oscar this year, but that really does not matter. Foxx took it to the whole nutritional level we had never witnessed before, and we doubt we could ever see again. I can't think of any other film I've ever seen, in which a person who plays so completely and convincingly becomes a man depicted. Hello, Mr. Foxx. We understand that awarding an Oscar has more to do with performance, but whether you win or not, we want you to know that you have done something that is in the classroom itself and you should have a huge pride in your unique success. PS Music was naturally great. I reminded my wife that if there was one moment in the history of music that I wished I could witness, it would be genesis (in Kansas City, right?) What did I say? The film did a great job with him - I just wish I was there!
