I believe John Houston's "The Dead" is a real classic. Not only is it Houston's final film, it is quoted as "all I know about filmmaking, it's in this movie." James Joyce's "Dubliners" story is a great set that presents Angela Houston, John's daughter, and cast of English and Irish actors who revive the story. It is a movie that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very appealing. The film is not rushed, nor is it accused of action. The story is based more on characters who bring light and meaning to dialogue. The end of the film is overwhelming, poetic and scary. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the best movies ever.
