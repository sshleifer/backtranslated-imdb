He found the copy in the bargain sale of this old classic. I played with dosbox on vista machine without any problems. It's graphically dated strongly, but what do you expect for a 12 year old game! The game is a hybrid game FPS / Adventure. That's what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, just spin in 360 (I mean Wolf3D). The game can be difficult with a very limited range of medical banks and a somewhat moderate interface (Tip: Press I), but on the whole it's clear. One of the main strengths of the game is the mood. There the game heavily uses full motion video, and while acting is b-grade and the storyline is very jerky, the game as a whole feels really scary. It also does a good job of giving you the question of "good guys". Are they really helping or just waiting for you to get stuck in your back? Another major selling point is the length of the game. There are 18 chapters in the memory that range from 10 minutes to, or hours. My first game took me a week with some serious dedication to time. <br /> <br /> Date, yes, but if you missed years ago and can find it for $ 5, check out. Cheaper than film and fun than most movies.
