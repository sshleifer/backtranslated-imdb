How do you know if a movie is good or not? The difference is what impact it has on you. "Dead Man Walking" very upset me. I've watched it twice. I don't know if I'm going to be strong enough to watch it again. No, I didn't feel well after watching, but the movie was as successful as it was possible. Robbins has done a great job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided an argument that could be easily perceived as biased or subjective. I hope many people will see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who supports or rejects the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the film. I do not know what else could finally convince everyone that this relic of ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore. The film itself is not an argument for or against the death penalty. It describes reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for great performances, good movie creation and for the most important movie shot in the years <br /> <br /> Thank you, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
