Lucio Fulci's "Don't Torture and Duckling" painted an extremely unflattering portrait of a small town of Sicily plagued by a series of brutal murders of young boys. The surprisingly well-directed film (especially in comparison with later Fulci's gorefests) is characterized by an overall atmosphere of perversion, ugliness, and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. Children who are soon dead are portrayed as carelessly cruel and hopeful peering cubs, Brun's close seduction of bare Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) must be really visible. I highly recommend - especially in pairs with my other cult favorite "Windows House Laughing" (1976).
