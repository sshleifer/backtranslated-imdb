Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are on top of their game already in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better film than MATRIX (1999), at least 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the gorgeous "Albatross" Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a very moody tone for the entire movie. It's a pity that this movie was never released on DVD. But now, after 37 years, they have finally come to the conclusion that this TV-movie is not just one of the best Fassbinder movies (though there are quiet and the best Fassbinder movies), it's a great example for a sci-fi movie without big money. Buy!! Bacha !!
