"Best In Show" follows the stories of a handful of contestants preparing for one of the biggest shows on the calendar. An amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and pet obsession is a sign of something missing in one's life, and each of the characters fills that clich√© somehow. There is a former High School Hottie who is now married to a geeky man, a childless, label-obsessed yuppie couple, a lonely outdoorsman, a young woman rich old coder (along with her shorthair dog trainer), and a gay couple. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so entertaining is how it displays these stereotypes in a completely believable way - in many cases almost lovingly. Every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with his dog as an innocent viewer - seems to be the type of behavior you would expect at the show. <br /> <br /> The greatest laughter comes from the American-style sports announcement team, comparing the moments in the dog show with parts of the baseball game and its English, canine academic, film. The rehearsals of a strange husband as his blond woman encounters an amazing number of men from her past is also always good for laughter, as well as the demented behavior of the yuppie couple while the pressure builds while their hound stays completely intact. Good to Watch Tracking - Even if cats are more of your bag.
