"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl with dreams of joining her beloved horse in a competition at the prestigious Grand National Horse race. The film follows her when she trains her horse with the help of former jockey and parent support. While "National Velvet" is a family movie, it should not deter anyone who usually watches such mocking movies. The film is really the one that will appeal to the whole family, not just the juveniles who are attractive. She even managed to cast five Oscar nominations, which is hardly a sign of relaxation for the audience. Anne Revere, part of Mother Velvet, won an Oscar for her performance. She was really excellent in the role, but she is a 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits talent over her years. Also on board are Oscar-winner Donald Crisp as Father Velveta, Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as the older sister Velveta. for an attractive viewing experience, while editing has made the second of the two film Oscars. In addition, the film was nominated for its direction (Clarence Brown), cinematography and direction art. Also worth mentioning is the tenfold nominee Oscar Herbert Stothart, though it was infallible. <br /> <br /> National Velvet is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of a film about a girl and her horse is not excited for some people, but this is worth it.
