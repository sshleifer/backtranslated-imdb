Although great at Boogie Nights, I think it was Burt Reynolds' best performance. He is also a great director and has created a hard, violent film that does not stick (a 12-track death hooker) and is an excellent detective story with some great actors (Brian Keith, Bernie Casey, etc.) jazz soundtrack. 10 of 10
