This is a esteemed movie from my childhood !! I can still hum the theme song in a hat drop! I remember staying too late to watch this movie with my father, usually two to three times a year. We have always referred to him as a "giant robot". Although the effects in this film are gross in comparison to today's standards, they were ideal for this film genre. I am also a big fan of Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie fell into place with others. It's been a few years since I saw this movie and I would like to take my hands on a copy to share it with my 8-year-old daughter.
