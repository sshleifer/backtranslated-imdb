This movie is extremely fun and entertaining, with suitable, fun and experienced castings. I regard this film as fun not only with humor but also with music in different scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, did a good job of being funny in many parts of the film along with Tom Selleck, who is incredibly different from many other movies. The humor in this film is goofy, which makes various exaggerations within many scenes, especially the starting pieces. Joan Cusack is also remarkably fun and exaggerated; and the same goes for all the other casts. This film has many elements of goofy humor and is pleasant if you want to laugh.
