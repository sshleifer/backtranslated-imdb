30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was made as a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke starred in this wonderful remake of a beloved teacher, Chippington, whom his beloved wife calls Chips. O'Toole was excellent here and won another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He lost the prestigious award 8 times. You also have to wonder that in 1969 he lost John Wayne for "True Grit", which was a testament to Mr. Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by the great performances of Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days," as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy." Surprised to see Petul Clarke cast as Mrs. Chippington. However, because it was a musical, he went through a beautiful voice and made a nice piece of play. Who can forget the scene when Chips continues the class despite his beloved message being killed in the bombing. He never told her an amazing news about his waiting promotion. Beautiful cinematography and music have enriched a truly memorable experience.
