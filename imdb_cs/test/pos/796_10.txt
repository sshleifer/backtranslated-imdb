I hardly know where to start writing about this jewel, except that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the peak of his power and must certainly take a position with half a dozen of the best short comedies ever made. The goat is twenty minutes of smooth, professionally photographed, beautifully made gags; two discs of a continuous comic invention powered by an unmistakable paranoid undercurrent, yet somehow leading to a happy ending - which was not always the case with Buster's comedy. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism eventually got better, or ONE WEEK for Defeatism victory.) If I had to describe this movie in one word, I'd say it "effortlessly," but if I were allowed two I would say "seemingly effortless" "because a lot of hard work goes into making any comic opus that develops with such exalted ease. Yet they didn't tell him it wasn't for nothing, but Buster never let the public sweat him. <br /> <br /> The sardonic subtitle card tells us that our opening sequence is set to "Millionaires Order". "ie bread in a grim urban environment where Buster waits patiently on the back of the line and does not get as a result." However, it should be emphasized that he does not play for pathos for a moment; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. Before long, despite a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is believed to be a leaked murderer named Dead Shot Dan and is watched by every cop for miles around, and yet, while he is clearly appalled by this turn of events there is \ t that it is a pity or even a surprise; we get the feeling that he always knew it was what he would have had for him, and that he had no time to regret himself, he had to come up with new ways to avoid those cops and escape from the last trap <br /> < Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy, he never seems to want to laugh, which is especially impressive because GOAT must be one of the most ridiculous short comedies in life. It is a movie that represents the iconic shot of Buster, who rides cat cages all the way to the camera lens, which is not a gag, but it is certainly ridiculous provocation in a special way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving weapons, dogs, cops, an incredibly hairy mustache, and a horse clay statue that melts under Buster's weight (surrealistic look really), but some of the greatest boffos are stored for the final when Buster is trying to avoid his primary nemesis, the great Joe Roberts, the ugly cop who also happens to be the head of the lady of Virginia Fox. Buster trapped in the Big Joe dining room, knocking frogs and sails over him through the passage, turning the phone booth into the elevator and pretending to disappear, and finally using the elevator himself to get rid of his pursuer and win the girl in time. for one last fad-out gag. <br /> <br /> To say more, it would be a service for the first audience. I wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen it before and were swimming in laughter. The live musical accompaniment would also be nice; And by the way the music score Cinema for their home video / DVD version of GOAT is top class, serving as a frosting on an already tasty cake.
