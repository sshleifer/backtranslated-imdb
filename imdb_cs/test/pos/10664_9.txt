"Bronenosets Potyomkin" is a milestone in cinematographic history and is one of a handful of great movies that deserves to be a classic. It was a film that made Sergei M. Eisenstein a figurine of film at the time. And today it is still remembered as an amazing piece of cinema that has always been. <br /> <br /> "Potyomkin" is a film that NEEDS to be seen as one entity, not to be selected. Don't just watch these clips show where they just show the 'Odessa steps' sequence and then move on to 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather'. . Don't expect every infinite detail to be perfect, I think the silent era of the 1920s makes 'Scooby Doo' a master of underrated realism, some plot points may seem illogical, and some of the battle sequences look dated, but that is an extremely enjoyable movie . The most memorable moments in the movie are the rebellion on the battleship, Vakulinchuk's body falling from the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead baby, the stroller on the steps of Odessa and the lion rising to the roar as she follows another bloodshed. For every new pair of eyes looking at it, the "Battleship Potemkin" comes to life again.
