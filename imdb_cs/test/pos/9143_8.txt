China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This production of U.K, / Holland / Hong Kong was filmed in English and was slightly modified for Western audiences. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) were to play together in the film, but were unavailable due to earlier commitments, so another western actor Steven Leigh appeared. Several Hong Kong stars like Tommy Wong (playing mute) and always the fearsome William Ho appear just like a director at an interesting place. Chow Brothers are in Holland to run a family business. They want the family business to go legit, but the other Asian gangs don't want and see that they move as a step to saving the face to please "strangers" and want to keep old fashion. Others want them to smuggle drugs and not. After the Chow Wren is shot dead by cold blood, the brothers move against a family that is not with them. Can the Chow family keep families from killing each other, or when the streets of Holland flow through the blood of innocence and gangsters? Very underrated film. I was surprised how well it was. I haven't seen the Hong Kong version. That would be a huge gift to me. It's longer and has a lot more stars in Hong Kong Cinema that are producing. Too bad this movie is not available on D.V.D. The video print I saw was washed out and the sound reproduction wasn't that great. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for action fans. Factoid: This film takes place before the drug is decriminalized in the Netherlands.
