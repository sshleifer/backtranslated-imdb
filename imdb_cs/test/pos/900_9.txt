Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard about the movie being released, I wanted to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not return and B) too many grotesques. However, I enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first movie, but it's good in its own way. Stephen Fung returns as an ultracool ladies man Match that has a stable girl in Oli (NOTE: Where's Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as a crazy alien (this time a mohawk sports and speaks a lot of English !! !!). The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. He's doing a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd with the performance of Agent Curtis ... he seems to be tough as nails, smartmouth FBI Agent you'd like to hate ... but you'll soon want his character. Combat scenes are much better at this ... though there are very few but they are great courtesy of Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Li. Check out the portraits by Ron Smoorenburg and with the warrior cage who has a small match with Match. Smoorenburg is also a sensational double for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you like GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS !!!
