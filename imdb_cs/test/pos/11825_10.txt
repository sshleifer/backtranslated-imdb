The Cure is an exceptional realistic drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. It's the story of a deep and expensive friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. He acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. Thus, he and his mom (Annabella Sciorra) became outcasts, avoiding the public and being called a dangerous society, basically because of the frequent lack of public knowledge of the disease. When Eric (Brad Renfro, known from 'Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother move to the house next to them, they have to deal with public insults and fear of AIDS hunting. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risk everything. He first starts talking to Dexter, but eventually climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by Joseph Mazzello Jurassic Park) and his games. Very fast, a real friendship with Dexter develops, which is gently built and fragile due to its condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film? a theme that makes it ubiquitous authentic and tragic at the same time? is how Eric and Dexter are trying to find the ultimate cure. First, do they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves? which is very naive but at the same time right as it shows how young children cope with such hideous diseases and how strongly they believe in the magic of the world. When he hears about an alleged drug that was developed in the south, they do not hesitate and take off on an adventure that brings them closer and symbolizes the ultimate hope of hope. aboard a raft and head south on the Mississippi River. What starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous business that is both emotionally interesting and instructive. The scene where Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe where everything is dark and cool, Eric hands him his sneaker, a symbol that wherever a boy can go, Eric is and will always be with him; he will never have to be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most convincing films, is characterized by a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who can avoid awkward and sinister dialogues and bring a very original performance that ultimately breaks its tenderness and sincerity. Br /> <br /> I will not further describe the story because I do not intend to give too much information. But the end is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much part of the tragedy that anyone who watches the film will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this film so strong, exceptional and so convincing. The emotional burden on each character is so real, so it is mumbling that even tougher audiences may need some hankies. 10 movies makes this movie fair and not too high. There is almost no other film I've seen so far in my life that it can handle such an emotional problem with so much wit and emotion. It's a story about how two boys enrich each other's life and learn about each other's life. So Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really counts in life; and both realize how much of the gift is a real friendship when it comes to the hardest moments of life. This film is tragic? But his message is a complete inspiration.
