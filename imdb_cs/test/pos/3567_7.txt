- A group of bandits rob a train of gold they wear. In the run, the bandits broke up. One thief who knows where gold is hidden is killed before he can speak. Three men have a different part of the "lead" that will lead to gold. Can a banker, a bandit and a hunting crew work together to find a missing prey? Or will they kill first? - The storyline is a clear flight of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and Ugly. Various scenes in the film are also picked up from other films by Leone, Corbucci, and more. But for me it is done in a way that does not show disrespect to the original work. Instead, each Gun Can Play can lovingly parody some of the biggest Spaghetti Western movies. The opening scene of the three men driving into the city and the final run between the three main stars is a wonderful tribute to the SW that came earlier. Castellari adds a lot of pleasant touches to his own - spilled wine, Stranger's entry with a vivid red background and a playful way of discovering gold. Though very incredible, many combat scenes are well staged and managed. The two combat scenes in particular (market fighting and fighting house combat) are very well done. They are also not afraid to try different things with their camera. Tight close-ups, overhead shots, and corner footage are common in Any Gun Can Play. Another plus is Castellari's cast. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And SW rookie Edd Byrnes owns two SW veterans. Supporting casting functions, among other things, regular Gerard Herter. No weapon can play too seriously. Nice impressions of humor can be found throughout the film. If possible with SW, it's rather a "good feeling" movie - very reminiscent of some of Terence Hill / Bud Spencer's movies.
