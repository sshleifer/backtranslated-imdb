Okay, I grew up on Who, but I didn't love a doctor from Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I will be with him forever when I leave. Writing is spectacular, acting great, directing (which was terrible in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program, and I watched it just out of need, but now I'm a huge fan and I love it (I have Dalek ringing shouting "Exterminate" then). Some Things I Like About the New Program - 1) People will notice when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. No one has noticed some old shows the assistant leaves for a while and then returns home as if nothing had happened. 2) Chris Eccleston's documentary loves Rose - romantic or not, will be discussed, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares for his companion. He would destroy the world if he had to save her, which was missing from the old exhibition - often the doctor wouldn't have cared if he had never seen his assistants. 3) He speaks and thinks like real people - when Rose appears unusual or new (like aliens), she acts like a real person - gobsmacked. I never liked it when an old show assistant, who had never seen anything alien, would just fit in and adapt immediately. I want to see a surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic figurine coming to life. It gives me. A few things I don't like about this series: 1) Almost everything is happening on Earth (London or Cardiff) and I was hoping for another world show. 2) That Eccleston left so fast he really did a great show. But I can let the few things go - I enjoy the series much more than I ever expected, so I don't mind if they have things on the ground. Just don't take this show seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's fun, but it's not a great serious show. It is pure fun and pure British, and I can't get enough. Watch it with open minds, and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - do not follow Series 2 or later. Series 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of Series 2 were good, but don't look at it once they get to Love and Monsters. Full waste, totally destroys the show.
