I usually don't like seeing movies when they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices, but I've seen a poster for some things that stay and I thought "this young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not the usual blonde." BS ". So I decided to dive in and see this movie at its opening night. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you that I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without any expectations. what it will be, but Katie Boland's raw emotions and honest publications have been quite satisfying with my decision.Albert Watson has also done a fantastic job as Tamara's sick mother, and I must add that I was quite impressed with Megan's comedy styles The park as a friend of Tamary Brendy. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderfully directed by Gail Harvey, and pulled together in a kind of kitschy 50's way that will leave you feeling warm and happy, even though the plot didn't tend to be so uplifting. I thought the movie was well shot, many beautiful landscapes of the 1950s will remain in my mind for weeks. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was unpredictable and great I found it unpredictable, and although the story ends in a rather open way, I was still satisfied. Whether you're looking for a fun but powerful age story, or just want to remember life in the fifties, I guarantee that this movie is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it is still very likely that you will be most impressed. Give this one shot!
