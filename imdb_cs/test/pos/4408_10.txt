I had to see it on television when it was first aired a few decades ago. I thought it was so brilliant, and I remember doing it right now. Even though I lived in London and around, I can't call myself London and I don't know at all - who else than taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the assumption; that there is a group of men who are trying to teach seemingly incapable and resurrect themselves to the demigods, then the rest is full of joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently influenced by film events. Don't think it's a document - it's pure drama and knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like that before or since. Bach!
