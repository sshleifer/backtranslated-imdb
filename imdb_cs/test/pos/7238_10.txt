This movie is really unique. It really captures the spirit of the game but makes it fun for the modern generation. The romance between Trome and Juliet was plausible and erotic, not removed by many adaptations. It's so funny that I almost cried with laughter. As with most Troms, it is in the face, taboo, gore and sex, yet you add a really good performance and Shakespeare's storyline. You must really see this movie to believe it! There are some hillarious credits in credits (the best credits I've seen from Hot Shots) load Troma in jokes, as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. And Lemmy tells the house from Motorhead. I lent this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job to get back. Three at best, this movie is really a gem and goes to my 5 best movies of all time. Although it is not the type of movie you would watch with your mum, and may offend some people. For everyone who is bored during a mill cinema, with a lousy sense of humor, YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.
