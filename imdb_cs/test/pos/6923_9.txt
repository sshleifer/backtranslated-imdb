This movie is a pleasure to watch and should do well on DVD and video. I suppose you really have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtleties, such as accent, colloquial, and dressing of some characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran goes for "Barrel", most people are familiar with Dublin because we have many characters in our beautiful city that look, act and talk like that! The simple comedy itself and Michael Caines perform themselves, it's worth the money, but it's a conspiracy, the script is fantastic and the dialogue is fast moving and catchy. The perfect light-hearted movie without the insanity of Jim Carrey's humor.
