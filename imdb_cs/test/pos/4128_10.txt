"Buddy Holly Story" shows the famous beginning of singer in soaked Lubbock, Texas, to his rise to fame, to his tragic death in a plane crash. This film is reinforced by Gary Busey, like Holly, playing her own instruments, this film is biopic in its purest form. There are some things that seem a little hackneyed, namely the people of Lubbock considering rock 'n' roles to be diabolical music, but master performances outweigh the weaknesses. If there is only one thing in this great world, it is sure that Buddy Holly's music will never go away. Whether it's "It will be a day", "Peggy Sue", or another of his songs, it still sounds great after all these years. He remains one of the greatest singers in history. Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son, they didn't have a street name after him until 37 years after his death! What a bunch of ingrates!
