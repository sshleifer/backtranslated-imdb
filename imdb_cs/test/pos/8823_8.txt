Much of my childhood was spent lying before the Round the Horne or Hancock's Half Hour or the Carry On movies. Probably the best-known line in the comedy "Catch! it still makes me laugh. This is a rare sight of a man behind a comic character, and the whole production is a great mix of tragedy and comedy until the final quote from the coroner's trial in four different voices of Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in this role. Most of the other Carry On team members were so-so and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen got off at the show and should be given awards. Feeling "wow". Quoting Kenneth Williams, a cynic who says 'life is a joke' the only answer can be 'Yes, so let's do it good.'
