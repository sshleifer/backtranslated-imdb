I understand how Barney may be uncomfortable for some, but the hate he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was made simply from the start and simplicity is not bad, especially for those who enjoy it. Personally, I consider this show to be very underrated. Barney & Friends is, in my opinion, a very educated show and even 17 years after her debut (and almost 21 years after the character's debut on home video), she proves again and again that she still appeals to young children. Maybe less than in the early 90s when Barney Hannah Montana was at that time, but he's still a classic. As a Barney fan myself, I feel like I should defend it in a way that doesn't look like spam. The way a violet guy teaches can be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather hear about the war? Being grateful to someone (a costume dinosaur, but still) is there for the comfort of children and letting them be kids just. Today, I feel that our children will grow up and grow up, and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child in your heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons about current plagiarism episodes that are sincere and yes ... even death could appeal to everyone, not just his target audience. In addition, our children must learn to be kind and respect others for who they are and help them do it. In short, Barney may be annoying for some people and I understand why, but I will limit it. The only thing he and his friends (together with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is to help kids not only learn the skills they need, but also to have fun and look at the positive parts of life. If more people listened to their children's favorite characters and looked at them with their eyes, maybe we wouldn't be so negative and maybe even life.
