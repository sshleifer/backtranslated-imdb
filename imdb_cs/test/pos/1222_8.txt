I watched Armored's preview and thought the movie would be either a very bad movie or a very good movie. Fortunately, the film was fun, exciting and realistic. There is never a perfect crime and Armored showed why. The film shows perfectly when people get into a stressful situation like animals. The last hour of the movie is very fun. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. It's hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I gave Armored eight out of ten. It's not a Christmas movie. Have I written ten lines yet? No way! By the way, there are not many action movies. Armor has a lot of excitement in it, giving the movie viewer a choice over another comedy.
