This is one scary underrated gemstone with freezing performances and a fantastic finale!. All the characters are great, and the story was amazing, plus I thought the end was really cool! The story was great, and it never bored me, and while the children actors were bad, they gave me a horror! It happened that on the space channel a while ago, so I decided to check it out and tape it, I read some good reviews from fellow horror fans, I must say I agree with them, it's very scary, and thrilling, plus Strother Martin , he was fantastic in his role, like a satanic worshiper. It has a lot of scary atmosphere, and it keeps you guessing all over, plus all the characters were very sympathetic, and you really start the root for Ben and his family!. He has a lot of distracting moments and the movie sometimes shocked me, plus it's very well done on a low budget! This is one creepy underrated gem, with chill performances and fantastic finals!, I highly recommend this!. The direction is very good! Bernard McEveety is doing a very good job here, working great with the camera, creating a lot of scary atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace. It's a little blood and gore. We get a broken leg, lots of bloody corpses, bloody crevices of the throat, slicing and slicing, decapitation and impulse. Acting is excellent! Strother Martin is fantastic! as a satanic worshiper, he is extremely fearsome, very convincing, he was quite chilling, he was extremely intense, he seemed to enjoy himself, and overall he did a fantastic job! Charles Bateman is great as a dad, he was very caring, very likeable and gave a good show!, I liked him a lot. L.Q. Jones is amazing as a sheriff, he was entertaining, besides things he looked very young, he had a great character and overall he did a great job! Ahna Capri is good as a girlfriend and she did what she had to do well. Charles Robinson went to great lengths as a priest and didn't convince me of one piece, and his laughter was particularly bad. Geri Reischl is actually decent as a daughter, she was somewhat sympathetic and a few times I got on my nerves, I rather liked her. Alvy Moore was goofy but very sympathetic in his role that Tobey dug him! The rest of the cast is good. Overall I highly recommend!. *** 1/2 of 5
