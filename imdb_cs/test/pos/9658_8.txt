Satisfaction of fantasy with ships sailing clouds with cannons, evil plotters, weird landscapes, time manipulations, large sets, invalidity of reality, perhaps as a never-ending story or some Merlin stuff. If you like it, you'll love it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. The fight with the sword is false. Music is nice. Good victory, kisses, everything is fine and the chef is pleased.
