A rather silly little movie that you may like. Although it is sometimes canyoned and clich√©, it works and makes good clean fun. Five teams are involved in scout hunting and are fighting each other and their wits to win all night - just for pleasure "knowing that your team is the best team." including David Naughton's first film role after his Dr. Pepper "Be Pepper" commercials and before his major 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London". He also presents Paul Ruebens in what I believe to be his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before he learned about him. Last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton, Michael J. Fox won his first film role here. Fans remember Stephen Furst as Flounder at Animal House. Besides, no names, but all the funny characters. Doubt it ever made it to DVD, but there are still some VHS copies floating around and you can even catch on late, late shows for some time. If so, it's worth your watch. You can hate it, but it can also become a quirky little movie you like.
