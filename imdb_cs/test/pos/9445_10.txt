I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of the recently finished Amanda Bynes show. I admire her (except her body) for her acting skills. She's a good actress. The movie was great. She is a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school cuts a girl's football team, she gets upset. Her brother is going to a prestigious school and decides to go to England. So Viola wants to impress by playing in a football team at a boarding school. He goes to school and tries for a football team. Meanwhile, he meets Duke, who is a sensitive man who plays on the football team. She likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who likes Sebastian, who is really a viola. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects Sebastian is not alone. This is definitely not a chick and I really enjoyed it. It's so fun and nice. I don't think I saw AManda act better.
