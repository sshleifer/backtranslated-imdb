Since I am from Eastern PA, right on the border of Northern New Jersey, I still feel it was more than a documentary. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents a kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in a lower income area outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you haven't seen this movie and wondered what's going on in the urban jungle, check out this movie. No really great actors, as if they were pulling these guys off the street and saying that this act, which contributes to the realism of the film, is a FANTASTIC! ATTENTION THIS FILM!
