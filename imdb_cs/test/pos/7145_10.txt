This version didn't move me as deep as the later Hollywood version with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and well done, the BBC version was more charged with the dialogue that provided the information I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed look at the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. This was therefore more interesting and challenging than the Hollywood version, but not so visually stunning or viscerally acting. Yet when I left a hill of sintered Kleenex in the theater, I used it at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film every bit as much as the Hollywood version and I was grateful for the greater understanding I gained.
