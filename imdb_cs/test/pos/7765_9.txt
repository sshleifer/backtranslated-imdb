This is my favorite movie that shows African-Americans in a very different light. because it shows another side of African Americans that it is not shown in movies. it is not a gang, a city ghetto, or it has to deal with deep racial problems, engage in the essence of youth and try to be successful and have trouble keeping your guard and leaving someone in his life, and the whole rich atmosphere gives the great touch that it makes it great, it's a great screenplay great dialogue that will captivate you and you just get involved in character. perfect casting with lots of chemistry and very good acting and i haven't seen any other movie with black characters that are displayed in this format only that is coming is "sprung" but because its comedy it loses very quickly i give this movie 9 of 10 and wish that they do films with this type of attitude about African Americans
