The whole series, not just the blue planet, is nothing less than amazing. The best natural series we've ever seen. The depth episode is like traveling to space! We watched it with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us were unable to pull away. We read a negative comment and couldn't believe it. There's so much new information we never learned at school. It is also the best view we have seen from any television or film in the delicate balance of our country's ecosystem. The amount of time and effort involved in capturing these shots is very obvious when you sit down and watch this series. <br /> <br /> Everyone must be seen.
