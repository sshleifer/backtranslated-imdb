After a somewhat slow start, I thought that this film about the Italian occupation of the Greek island during World War II took a few hours to watch, especially in two ways. The Love Triangle is interesting and strikes me as trustworthy because I know it happened at different places in the occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl who married Mandras (Christian Bale). From the beginning I had questions about the depth of their love, but their future was torn when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went into battle. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island of Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and falls in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women. in the occupied countries. When they met their inhabitants, they began to see them as an enemy, but as real people and sometimes fell in love - often to the disagreement of their neighbors. I have just read an interesting book about the German occupation of the Channel Islands where it was a major problem. When Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. The second problem in the background is the Italian occupation, which I thought was realistic. At first, there was contempt for the island to treat its Italian occupiers. Greece has beaten Italy (quite true from a historical point of view) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the city to surrender to the Italians and instead to surrender to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and in fact it was quite funny. I loved the line, "we would rather surrender to this German German council "Dog than you Italian.") The depiction of Italian troops also struck me as believable. " The Italian army was never in love with their German ally and was never thrilled with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to deal with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops simply cannot understand on the island) and are thrilled when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until it finds out that it could make them a prisoner. The Germans. I thought it was pretty good. At the end it beats a bit, it's too predictable, but deserves praise. <br/> 7/10
