"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most intelligent and accurate movies about what a real artist is supposed to be. The key lines in "Babette's Holiday" are not, as some other commentators say, "the artist is never poor", but two lines that come before and after him: <br /> <br /> "I was able to make them happy when I gave the best. ... There is one long scream from the artist's heart all over the world: give me a chance to do the best. I spent nine years producing an experimental multimedia music theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc. trying to do the best. They were just like Babette: they desperately wanted every dollar to do their job. Babette's art is fine French cooking, and for her to make her art at its best cost of 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile from France, isolated with two care spiners on a bleak Scandinavian coast, suddenly gets an unexpected amount of 10,000 francs, he will do what any real artist would do: he sees that he has an unexpected chance to do her best, and so it does. She spends all the money to work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we do not know that he is such an artist until he is actually cooking and serving food. Until then, it seems to be just a French working-class lady who makes a living with the merchants and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris in 1871). It is secondary to such an artist whether there is an audience for art that can appreciate it. That's why the author set this dinner in a community of people who couldn't have understood what they were getting. Babette did not cook this food as a gift to two spinsters, or a religious community. It was not her goal of reconciliation or the spirit of good feelings among the members of a small religious sect. Indeed, she never once leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After eating, she sits alone, sipping wine and not paying attention to how the guests reacted. She is heated in satisfaction to finally have a chance to do her best as an artist. That's why he's so satisfying and so important to the story that the general unexpectedly shows up - because, as Babette immediately knows, the general will know what she put in front of him and appreciate it. There is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art that is manifested to the viewer, who is lacking even one person who is able to appreciate it. She's glad, very glad she came, in fact, he's the only guest she ever mentioned during dinner. But she hadn't planned food because she knew such a man would come. Everyone who had the opportunity to enjoy a world-class Parisian dinner as I had (my father was a naval attache to Paris in the 1980s, and I had my honeymoon in France), dinner, and Babette's satisfaction with it , and the pleasure it brings to the guests is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to give the recipient a sense of joy, it is a fine French dish cooked and served in France. This film presents claims about the transformational effects of great art on the recipient. Before dinner, members of a small religious sect argue, dredging the old grudge. Old anthems cannot restore good community; people ignore them, talk about them. But the common sense of great sense art - for people to enjoy the taste of food and wine, even though they have no idea that they are experiencing great art - they contain people, puts them in forgiving moods, reconciles them, and encourages them by making them happy to love, and thus has a divine sacred effect bringing peace. This is an assertion found in the modern art movement today - that art can replace traditional religion in making humanity more peaceful. Unlike those commentators who say that this film speaks of the power of the Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal the wounds that a Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this claim - that art brings peace that religion cannot - is overcrowded and void. But it's a pretty conceit and it's the second major theme of this beautiful movie. Last Note: When Babette arrives at home spinsters', a particular French General Galliffet is named a person who in 1871 executed Babett's husband and son and imposed a military government that she had to flee. At the end of the film, as the general tells the story of a magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years ago (before 1871), at the end of some military maneuvers, it turns out that the same Galliffet was his guest at the meal. As the general tells the story, French General Galliffet praised the cook of the meal as the greatest woman, the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course, the woman was Babette. It is therefore ironic that the same French general, who said that Babetta was honored over all the other women, was responsible for taking her forever from France.
