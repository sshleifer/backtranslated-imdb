This wonderful movie never let me down. Color, compelling cast and stunning scenery make great contributions. Unlike Carlton's later remix, this production is more impressionistic and presented more from the children's perspective. Rather, he focuses on some episodes from the charming E story. Don't beat, rather than try to do a little more "wart and all" documentary style that Carlton has accepted. Above all, the great musical result of the last Johnny Douglas is the foundation of the story and adds more emotional depth. The pure result is truly an impressive combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the annoying story of "Railway Children". One of the unpleasant factors for a viewer to think about in this movie is how things have changed since then. times - and in many ways worse! Yes, perhaps many of us no longer need to use the toilets and travel in horse-drawn carriages, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider celebrities who are now grace on our TV screens. Their language is now considered to be absolutely acceptable. Also, consider the fragile aspects of "today's, gone tomorrow" of so many today's "partnerships" and all single mothers - what happened to the institution called "marriage" when people allowed each other deficiencies, but still stayed together, love their children ? These details add extra piquancy when you watch this amazing movie. <br /> <br /> I hope children will enjoy this movie. Not to mention some adults!
