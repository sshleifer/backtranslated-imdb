When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a movie about their band, I got scared! I love their music and I was hoping this movie would be really fun! Now that I have watched, I cannot say that these hopes were not satisfied, but I think I expected more. The movie is full of Tenacious D's great music and I really like listening to everything. There are plenty of great jokes and I just love the story, at least the first bit. I don't like the way the movie ends. The end is very sudden, and in my opinion, they could extend it a little more. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a good movie you're watching! Anyone who likes rock music should watch her! This will give you a good laugh!
