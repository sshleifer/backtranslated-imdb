We loved this movie because it was so fun and off to beat - not your usual Hollywood drivel. My husband had a blockbuster coupon and handed over a number of new versions of violent Hollywood stuff. He was going to go out when he saw it and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy - and some DVD defects that we had to flip over to a wide screen and then back to the full version to stop. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and so ideal for the role. And he can also sing! If only Hollywood learned from independent filmmakers! Maybe we should go back to real movies. But for the time being we keep out of the rhythm and really entertaining movies like this! Other examples we have enjoyed include: A Box Full of Moonlight, Pieces of April, bringing Milo, The Proestesy The Celestine Prophesy. Most of them are Christopher Guest as: Best in Show, for your consideration, a mighty wind, and waiting for Guffman
