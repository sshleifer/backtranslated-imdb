This time, dear dimwit gets a summons for the jury, where a corrupt lawyer notices that he looks like a prisoner who wants to break free so the two switch. Most of the film is of course a series of gags; in "Ernest Goes To Prison", most of the gags relate to electricity. At the beginning I really liked the whole vacuum cleaner sequence. Overall, the purpose of the film is just to have fun and I'm sure you'll be. This is perhaps the best movie you're watching with me. It's pretty safe to say that Jim Varney will really be missing. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other member I met was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You must have seen him somewhere.
