Two actors play rival gangsters in three movies, the last of which is a sci-fi film that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and anime at once. The robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (several visual cues to the film can also be found) and the bad is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through the use of a mandatory drug for "heterosexual" love is ephemeral and homosexual love is eternal ". ... fighting martial arts, first for dead or live movies. This hilarious climax leads both heads to morph into a winged robot with a huge phallus for the head that embodies "destruction", which is the way both characters travel so far, their individual minds and later literal heads function like testicles. The film ends with the mayor f * &% of his son, who plays with jazz when the robot apparently tears the wall around them, the last words of the mayor "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick escape to black. Part of me felt cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I just laughed. However, a lot of the movie is quite boring, the best scenes to reserve a movie, while the rest is too slow. Takashi Miike has always drawn up sexual motives under male violence in action movies, and this film, with the exception of "Gozu", reinforces this topic more than any other. Sex and violence are two very basic themes, but as Cronerberg (who can be jazz intermdes can be a tribute to ala Naked Lunch) Miike is able to show where these two are joining, to a hilariously strangely coherent effect.
