WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although this film has occasionally moved more slowly, brilliant scenery, character richness and powerful motifs make "Morte and Venezia" a beneficial experience. I haven't read Thomas Mann's book, but I'm sure Visconti's visual splendor, musical score, and strong induction of conflict and desire must do justice. Gustav von Aschenbach's study highlights the tendency of man to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behavior and passion. This tendency is demonstrated on the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes music as mathematical - ie. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in a scene where young Tadzio plays in the Fuer Elise lobby and Gustav recalls his visit to the brothel where he is attracted to a prostitute playing the same song. In his flashback, after paying a prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically caught by the consequences of his actions. This reaction is a reminder of the moral response to the temptation that Tadzio represents. Finally, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: to stay in Venice and give up his request and temptation? Or escape from Venice to save your own life? His early attempt to escape from Venice at the train station resulted in vanity and foreshadowed the result of extending his stay. Filling the captivating character interaction, the mighty scenery of Visconti (especially Venice in Dawn and the last scene) Tadzio, who goes into the water and heads for the horizon, makes this film a true masterpiece.
