This film would be considered controversial today, but it is still very funny. Racial stereotypes happen from the perspective of humor and not hate. This film is being removed and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the early 1930s. This film proves that it began before the 1970s and beyond when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre, although his character grew up in China. The importance of cat paws in this case is the person who stands for a political office but is used by an established political machine to advance their agenda. In other words, they think that the guy (Lloyd) is harmless when running to office. Then when they choose, they are surprised. Same theme used later in James Stewarts movie Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is smarter and softer, which is a trademark of Harold Lloyds. There is still a heart of romantic comedy hidden with the facade of the film, but today's mainstream audience would still appreciate political humor and the ending is absolutely priceless. I wish someone would defeat today's political system. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie and that I wanted Harold to do more during the 1930s. At least we have this. I think the one most cited in the movie is the fictional Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was wise, but this makes me believe that China's wisdom wasn't limited to him and it's a huge field of Lloyd's comedy in this movie.
