This film is not only about feelings and human emotions, but also about everything that could be, but not. Film poetry can be terribly boring and uncomfortable, but this movie is amazing to watch. Not to mention the amazing Irene Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best. When the movie is over, you can only apologize. After all, if something is really great, we want more (Well, for another great K Kyslowski with Irene Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique)
