I like this show. It is smart and very good. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. Writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I am always amazed at how it provoked and enjoyed this show. My only complaint would be if Donna Murphy did not appear at this point in the second season. As a former wife of David Morse, Heather, she added such a character to the show. I think this show is due to the genre of crime / drama. With that said - I can't understand for me why this show has such a low rating. Could someone please who gave this show 1 review back with criticism?
