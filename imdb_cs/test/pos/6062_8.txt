'Rejseholdet' is one of the best new Danish TV series I have watched. The series is about the Danish Police Unit 1 - something like an FBI-style team that helps solve murder cases around the world by countries and cases they work on, plus the impact their jobs have on their personal life, and the price they must sometimes pay for being part of a top police team. I didn't do not wait too much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it has both drama and tension, I love it.
