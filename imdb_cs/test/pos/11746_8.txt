This film immediately captivates, with atmospheric aerial views of the very nice Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of the 1950s that never caught the modern blockbuster. Probably a sign of these times, because it's not very strong, seen it all before the film, full of confusion and violence. But shock and violence are in the background when thousands of refugees try to get out of China. It is a very moving and convincing story full of hope and love in a tragic time, in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures in love. And the build-up they are trying to overcome is the heart of this very fine and moving movie.
