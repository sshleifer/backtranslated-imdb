When I was younger, this film was always aired on Friday night in summer on Channel 40 (years before Fox Network was taken over and programming). I've always been looking forward to it. I would go shopping with my parents, then sit with my Swanson TV dinner and Lady Lee Cola (the only week of the week I had the opportunity to drink Coke and enjoy. Sure, the script is predictably late in the 1970s (like Little Darlings), but This funny movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper, Bill Murray resides with little effort in the movie, but he's charming, I have to love Spaz and those recorded glasses (before the Revenge of the Nerds). "My Bodyguard" but it does so well.
