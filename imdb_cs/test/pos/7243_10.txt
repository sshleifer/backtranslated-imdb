I totally agree with another poster. NEMESIS is one of Christie's best adaptations to superlative conspiracy and cast. The scene involving Liz Fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a study that works at the best level. This woman, who was underestimated, was in the 1960s a British fave film that never got into American movies. Look at her as Julie Andrews's friend in EMILY EMILY in 1964. \ t Shame on them! And kick lesbian agents CID! :)
