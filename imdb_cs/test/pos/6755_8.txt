One of Starewicz's longest and weirdest short films follows a dog in search of an orange after he has revived the tear of a girl's mother who longs for orange. The dog comes orange after he has fallen out of the back of the car on the way he is supposed to sell, but at night he must protect the orange when he comes to the evil nightclub with many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets orange back to the baby girl and she is saved from the horrible fucking death. The mascot introduces new techniques I've never seen in Starewicz's films. Adding sync audio and a live action combination with stop-motion animation creates a new twist on Starewicz's old style of puppetry. The vibrant scenes of moving cars and the feet of people who walk like puppets sit on the concrete pavement, and are impressive and fresh. Honing cars and street vendors is remarkable because the small studio moves to the sound were expensive and Starewicz's use of the new technology seems like an old hat. New puppet characters in this movie are terrifying contributions to the club scene of the devil. Twigss and newspaper pieces come to life. The skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that hatch the skeletons of the offspring. Characters come from all corners to heels and pelvis and rocking horses. The new editing technique uses fast zooming that is done by editing to speed up the pace of what may have been a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his filmmaking style to meet the demands of the new audience, making this one of the best examples of his work.
