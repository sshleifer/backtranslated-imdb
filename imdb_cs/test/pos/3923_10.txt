I recently saw House of Wax and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It's one of the best Horror / Thriller movies for the past few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people arguing about the so-called slow start and development of characters that take 45 minutes to start movies. yet, when the film went straight to death, viewers and critics would criticize the film for not having decent characters that they wouldn't care less about. <br /> <br /> as well as for character development, I think it worked amazingly well. Taking into my own reactions and more (from reading message boards), many people ended up wanting to live characters, one of whom I noticed many people mention about Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). with regard to Warner. Bros. marketing their deaths, her surprise turned to the fact that many viewers brought her to cheering for survival. <br /> <br /> When they talked about chase / death scenes, they were some of the most innovative and inspiring ones I witnessed and enjoyed a lot. Playing in the movie was absolutely okay, I couldn't think of them any bad, especially Paris Hilton, to be very decent and I was hoping to get over 25 minutes of screen in 120 minutes of the movie But her chase scene is behind it, and believe me, when I say Paris can act fear, (Look at the scene where hiding in a car from Vincent and walks past her ... the look of horror on her face appears as VERY real ). Overall, I give House of Wax even the most stars, for fun and tension, and even gore ... ... only criticism I do not want to reveal the list of deaths during film marketing and who will die and who will survive how it was I was ten times better when I didn't know if the character being persecuted would live or die and terrible death. <br /> <br /> can't wait for a DVD, but look at it in the cinema when you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, but if you wait for a DVD, watch a movie in the dark without interruption, believe me that you will not be disappointed.
