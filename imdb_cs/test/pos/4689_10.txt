I remember watching this series every Saturday night. That was the peak of the week. I loved it all, the place, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clann√°d (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of leaving Michael Praed by creating another Robin, this time Earl of Huntingdon. I believe that in the Middle Ages there were legends of several Robin. Another thing I loved was the fact that she was filled with young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men will have a youth after all these people have not lived that long. The other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner looked like Robin's grandfather with his ridiculous accent). The only sad thing was over, it's a pity they couldn't at least make a single special event that would tie all the loose ends and make a happier end.
