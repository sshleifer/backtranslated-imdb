So after years and years I finally watched this movie! I was dying to see how it lived according to my memories. Clearly, I remembered the shots of the ghost running down, waiting for two wooden boards that crossed in the shaft, staring with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most vibrant shot of my childhood. Watching him now, apparently nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. If someone wants a copy, a private message. The story itself is a fairly standard BCFF material. It is strange that this time the message is rather unclear - there is no real morality as such (except that "the spirits are here to help us?" Or "have they not been prejudiced against the spirits!") for profit from the mine. However, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging both children to actually follow the vague consequences of the spirit not only into the mine, but into a new mine hole that is absolutely dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to climb the huge ladder, deep down, simply because they think the spirit wants it. It is also a little strange that the spirit chooses the boys to help the trapped adults, and not just help the adults trapped. Oh, good.
