I have already written my commentary on this film under the name BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I want to add something! After a long time I saw a lot of so-called heroic bloodshed! But many of them are approaching the event featured in John Woo's movies! That's why after all these years I think it's strange that "China White" doesn't get the credit they deserve! No matter what version you saw! The action is up! The scenery, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You get the impression it's a big neighborhood. But when I lived alone in Amsterdam, I know it's just a small part of the Red Light District that has many Chinese shops and restaurants! But given how they made the film, it looks like it's a big and important area where people don't know they're going to play with the triads (Chinese mafia)! In addition to the "China White" action, a compelling gangster drama with some good acting! For this I have to give credit to Russel Wong! Too bad we haven't seen him much lately because he has great potential! Must see the movie!
