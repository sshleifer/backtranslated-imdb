Kite Runner should win an Oscar! It's perfect in every sense, story, script, acting, cinematography ... You'd never know it was filmed in China. The story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult life leaves a lasting impression. Depicting life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is too real and frightening. I did not read the book, but I saw comments that postponed the film because "the book is always better" ... It doesn't matter. Nobody put aside "Gone With The Wind" because it wasn't true for the book! In fact, she won an Oscar for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is great - BRAVO writer and director and actors!
