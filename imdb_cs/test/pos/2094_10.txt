What I got was something better. Like many movies I commented on, I was looking forward to this time. Especially after I saw one of the other Toshiaki Toyoda movies, "Blue Spring," which is easily in my top 20 movies. I loved the "9 Souls" trailer and I thought it sounded very good. I haven't heard anything bad about it. Now I know why. This film begins as a kind of comedy, then something else quickly becomes the last half of the movie. It becomes more dramatic because each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets only so much time on the screen and it depends on what happens to each of them. Although we only have two characters to learn and take care of, in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda takes it brilliantly. at least as good as it was in the movie. I have a wish, because the "9 Souls" soundtrack was also incredible. The music used in every scene, more precisely the more dramatic, is simply simply amazing. I loved every second. I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar," but after I saw it, I'm going. Definitely. Also because I read the story about it and I think it sounds really good. I look forward to it. On DVD DVD "9 Souls" there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has finished another film and wants to start writing the script for his next one. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You have to see that. Now.
