This film is a summary of Visconti's obsession: the decline of nobility, death, aesthetic quest, homosexuality ... They all mixed with a melancholic mastery. Slowly-walked just to make you abler think about all his beauty (which is in music and pictures as well as in the story) this is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. Real fruit genius like Visconti.
