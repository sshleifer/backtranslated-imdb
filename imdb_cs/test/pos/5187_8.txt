I recently bought it on DVD as I didn't hear about it and as Robert Carlyle. Of course, this movie won't have a special Hollywood blockbuster when it says that even though the special effects were pretty decent and the acting was fine too. <br /> <br /> I found the movie to be enjoyable and not regret at all, for almost 2 hours it's just the right length for this type of movie. Br /> <br /> Don't expect the exciting explosive action from start to finish to be a pretty well-balanced movie with a pretty decent story!
