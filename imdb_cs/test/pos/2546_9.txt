This is one of those movies when you look at whether it's a documentary or a feature film. After the film, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film has a script. Bahrani's camera is silent, not decisive, almost erasing the director from the movie by purpose, the background is not organized to make the picture nice but don't get me wrong; There's a lot of preparation for this movie. Starting with a personal level that is part of the environment and which will be ignored in the movie. The main character is the "real" actor in every sense. <br /> <br /> I'd like to thank all the members for this movie and show us another country in NYC. I highly recommend if you like the stories of others. Bora Kizilirmak
