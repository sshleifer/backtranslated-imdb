I had the honor to watch Mar Adentro last Friday and I am still shocked by its beauty, the strong work of every single actor and actress, and the incredible ability of Amenabar to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain and asked for legal euthanasia, lost its cause, and finally She died in front of a camera who drank a poison glass, all of our hearts froze, determined not to live forever immobilized for the accident. Before watching the movie, I was already fascinated by the strong symbolism in her title, which I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not as some suggest "Out to sea" and which is taken from the original poem written by a man about which this story is about. Then I watched the movie. My friends. This is Cinema with Capital C. The narrative revolves to take you to the heart of every single character: Sampedro, reincarnated in Bardem, which you have forgotten from the outset, is in the midst of a man full of sense of humor and full of hope and his hope to die because for him the life that lives is not worthy to live. But the rest of the characters dance around him and respect his decisions because he sees him as a human independent being (forgetting that everyone cares about everything), even if they love him so much. And that's the movie: love. You feel it, you can breathe in the skin of every character. You are witnessing the growing sense of the three women who meet him in the film: Gene, a member of the association advocating his right to die dignified, his friend, her film story is a hope for the happy ones to live a normal life in this world; Rosa, a woman who meets a good man in the middle of a list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used and despised her; Julia, a woman who shares the tragic fate with Ramon, and finally behaves as we can't, but we just understand. Before they met these women, Ramón knew what love was because you couldn't meet him without loving him, and deeply loved by his dissatisfied family: Four characters unique in their Humility and bravery, each with their own thoughts of their decision, everyone thought he was decent in his own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that no one is to blame for what happened. Unfortunately, life is terrible. From this familiar quartet, I have been very fond of Mabel River's work as Ramón's sister lawyer, Manuel: amazing performance. I'd like to draw attention to three episodes that are the best points I've ever seen. After a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie read this, go through this paragraph and read it again from the next beginning of "Mar Adentro", let the movie show your secret to you. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I saw in the movie when I really felt like I was on the screen is when Ramón dreams of flying on Julia on the beach and kissing. 2. Gene spoke to Ramon on the phone the day before he did, and he told her it was better that they were goodbye to say goodbye at that moment, not to have trouble with her. And then she knows it's the last time they're talking, and she fought for her right to die ... but she doesn't want to lose him because she loves him as a real friend, and even if she respects her decision at all costs. 1. Best. Young Ramón on the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumping into the water from the rocks to the sea that recedes. We see a crash, we hear his voice, remembering what happened, and he said the moment was supposed to die. Bardem's face, pointing down, showed us from below. And the hand of a friend who pulls him out of his forehead and brings him back to life that will be hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, such as the impressive ending, despite the fact that we know too well in Spain what Ramon did. Mar adentro didn't disappoint me, Amenabar would never do it, but this time he would like to thank the actors who participated in the project and who might have taken it personally, because it's not just a movie, it's the man who died alone when he asked to die "legally", which meant to him how Bardem showed, dying with the people he loved and who loved him.
