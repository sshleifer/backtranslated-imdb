"Two Hands" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalog. It's the curious mixture of real life, surrealist life, comedy, tragedy and love that Australians have developed themselves. Heath Ledger is basically a good naive man. He wanted to get to the local "Big" Mana Panda (Bryan Brown). But the moment he puts his first finger on the dark road to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change your life unexpectedly. After accidentally getting to the wrong side of Panda, things get very bad very quickly, and if not for little help from another world, it would be a short sad movie. Yes, Jimmy is learning a few lessons in life and no one gets hurt in one way or another, but at the end he feels good. Although the story is a legal subject, it is not celebrated and helps show how destructive crime can be on normal lives. Heath Ledger is as excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time. Rose is hypnotic because Alex and Bryan are amazing as usual. This is a small set of characters that are believable, and I've found that I care about good people and don't like baddies. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in a cheap aisle, so I would recommend you to add your DVD collection, it would be well spent money. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
