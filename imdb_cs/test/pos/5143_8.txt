In 'Hoot' Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, a new school boy who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is much different than Montana. Despite mixing problems, Roy finds a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to the city, and the families of scrabble owls are in trouble. Can a new baby, a savage girl (Brie Larson) and a refugee (Cody Linley) stop big stores to destroy the home of these owls? This movie was pretty good. Children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but he really doesn't have a big part. Neither Robert Wagner (Mayor) nor Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). However, it was a fun movie that the whole family would enjoy. For the first producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett was putting together a good job. Plus the owls were really cute.
