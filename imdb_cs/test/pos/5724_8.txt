Tempo Di Uccidere (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a little strange movie, but it's good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with the summary of the plot. Most of what I read makes a bad impression, and I believe that most people who wrote those do not understand the film. And you have to understand it at a certain level, even if you can't describe what it is. This film is strange in the way "once time in America" ​​- just shorter. Many "Hollywood" stars (which may mean ...) played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is known that many actors are doing this, who are behind their prime or rising slowly. Cage wasn't a real star when it happened. I'm not his fan. He is very good at some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing the Dead) and weak when playing a hero. In fact, I don't know what to think of him, but he certainly doesn't portray the main character. This movie could do without it, but the fact that it played may be the only reason it happened on DVD. <br /> <br /> The support cast is good. Neither of them seems to be fake and it is as if they were really there. Fixed support. I've seen three Montaldo films (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he's one of the greatest directors of this time. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This film was his last in a long time (break of 19 years). I think this movie may have failed in the office, but I think it was a personal project for Montaldo that he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is great. It's always enough. Dusty army camps, claustophobic cities and beautiful landscapes play a big role. It all looks very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but Ennio Morricone's music is very good. It's not the piece that you whistle when in the shower, but it works great. So this movie looks, feels and sounds right. It does not serve the lesson of it on the golden plate, but it can be the biggest difference between Hollywood and the euro cinema all around. It may sound strange to give him 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I'm doing. If you're looking for action; Avoid This! If you are looking for a well-executed Apocalypse now at a different time and setting, but with a similar path to "mind state" (sorry if it sounds good, but I don't know what else to call) it might be like.
