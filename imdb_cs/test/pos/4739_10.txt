If you want to see real evidence of what a misleading and uncontrolled government can do for "non-popular" people, this film provides it. Read what some people say about the "Patriot Act" passed after 9/11 and then watch this movie. It's worth it? Do we really want to give these people freedom? No matter what you saw on TV, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for citing another reviewer, but it should be repeated: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said, "What is interesting when you are looking for people who are unbalanced fanatics ... you won't find them among David's affiliates, you find them between FBI and alcohol , tobacco and firearms are people in this film who deserve to be afraid, I think. "I think every person responsible for September 11 must be brought to justice, but I think the government has not shown a history of honoring the duty to protect human rights and this film proves it in a dramatic way.
