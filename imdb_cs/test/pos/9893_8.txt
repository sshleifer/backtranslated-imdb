Peter is on top, acting and looking great. He feels like watching a live game, working a great camera and I was sad that it was over. You can't wait to be on the big screen. Super cast, it could be a big hit. I like the way children communicate as a sister and two brothers, really thinking about my own brothers going through a situation like what Peter, a happy father who thinks he'll end his life after a big party ... Colors and the sets were amazing in the eye, they dragged you so much into the movie / game ... I was so happy to see that Peter is not Colombo, this guy can always act, and now it's a movie that gives him that range. I recommend you take your family to this movie. Maybe teenagers won't get much of it, no guns, fast cars, silly lines, stupid fucking jokes ... but your adult kids will love it. Good night show with them. Jason
