I was ten years old when I saw Subspecies, I immediately had hots for Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they have some great on-screen chemistry in earlier parts of the movie. In 1993 I ordered a Full Moon copy and learned: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have a much bigger role with the king in the script. What most people do not know is that there was an alternate sequence that should have occurred in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan get into the room, and Michelle has an idea for Stefan to make her a vampire to help drive away the Council and her demonic-controlled former friends . However, for some reason or another, that scenario will never look at the camera. The next scene in the script, which can be confirmed from the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in a trailer you see coming with blood on his chin. This film gets 9 because it's one of my childhoods and I have memories of those characters; Although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hove's Radu is a pure feeling of acting, so much of his work.
