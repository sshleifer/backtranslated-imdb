The brilliance of this film does not lie in the film process, which is a conventional but executed, intertwined story of the lies of the three soldiers after World War II, but in the fact that this story was ever told. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for his desire to push a film that has a disabled veterinarian with hand tongs, an alcoholic, and a cheater for his leadership.
