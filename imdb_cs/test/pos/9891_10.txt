I understand that "Checking Out" is likely to be released in US theaters in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is not to miss "Checking Out" !! This comedy movie will entertain anyone who will apply to characters, family relationships, and the many social issues that are displayed. "Checking Out" lets you laugh with a quick, clever humor built into almost every line, and can also cry fiercely. The topic of suicide is dealt with comically, which can also help people who think they understand the effects of this law on those who have touched their lives and those who love them. Hopefully, "Checking Out" can have a positive impact and help those who think about suicide not to work, especially in the 16-25 year olds who have the highest suicide rates in the US. The script is beautifully written, perfectly cast and packed with synchronicity and meaningful flashbacks over time, becoming more evident throughout the film and especially at the end. I believe that the screenplay is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and Play (The Phoenix Film Festival awarded "Best Screenplay Award" with "Checking Out"). The cast is loaded with the great actors who do it themselves and have a long history of great performances, game nominations and victories. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" is worthy of an Oscar nomination and is the most challenging and extensive career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falck as her father is a masterpiece and was awarded the Best Actor Award at the Palm Beach International Film Festival. Even teenage characters in the film are played by young actors Dan Byrd (Films: Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff; 3 Young Artist Nominations, Won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Monster Island, Wolf Lake Passions, Touched and Angel; 2 Young Star Nominations). Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane develops characters, their relationships and the story of this entertaining, fun, yet complicated scenario. <br /> <br /> Editing a movie keeps the movie moving fast, just slowing it down in charming scenes, so the audience will never lose interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie, which you can take the whole family see and everyone will enjoy.
