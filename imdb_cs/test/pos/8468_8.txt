This is quite an interesting experiment. It is the first, still existing, attempt to unify the view with sound. It features two men dancing to a violinist (possibly William KL Dickson himself), who stands next to the Edison Recording War, that is sound capture. <br /> <br /> The sound and images weren't connected as one more. Until recently, sound and image were added technically. It's probably why people are hesitant to call this movie as the first ever sound picture. The film is made by William K.L. Dickson, assistant to Thomas Edison, who instructed him to come up with a way to combine pictures and sound. The answer was given to him by the Kinetophone, Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a peephole in it, so people could watch moving images) with a cylindrical phonograph inside, for sound. This is the first we know of surviving film experiments that characterize this technique. All later films using the same technique were taken as silent movies, and the sound effects were recorded later and separately. So, Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and image, but rather to attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound cylinders, representing 3 different orchestral performances accompanying the images. Only 45 Kinetophones were made, so you can hardly call Kinephone success. Also after this experiment, attention was focused on other cinematographic techniques, especially film projectors. So the experiment itself did not seem to be successful, also because it took more than 30 years before the first sound movies were made and commercially released. They just could not technically synchronize and give sound and images at that time, and even if it were possible and the techniques would be available, it would be very expensive to do so. It is therefore not the most influential or historically important film history film, but it is very interesting to see how people have constantly tried to improve the quality and technique of early film and film making. <br /> <br /> 8/10
