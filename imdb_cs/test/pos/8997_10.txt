This movie made me a rugby - and coach Larry Gelwix - a fan. The characters of the story slipped and fell before they began to grow up when they struggled with incredibly strong conflicts. They were understandable and absolutely believable. Like life, there were no simple answers to the problems everyone faced. Excellent actors and an excellent script have revived this real story. I wish there were more movies. These days I watch almost exclusively valuable and true stories because they are usually more interesting than fiction. In addition, this is inspiring and teaches us not to give up on anyone too quickly.
