I've never seen Dr. Whoa (at least not in a focused way), so I was a new concept. I must say that the new exhibition works very well. It's funny (it should also say "comedy" in the genre description, many plots are only acceptable because of their comedy value), it's well written and makes a modest budget. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows. I saw the first eight episodes and # 6-8 were the most popular so far. Even types of stories that are too easy to pop up (with time travel, rescuing dead parents, and things like that) work great here. Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch funny and cheerful, though occasionally morose doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him, I'll be pretty surprised. But I'm willing to give the new man a chance. However, there is little doubt that Eccleston's episodes will be a classic in history. The relationship between doctor and rose is particularly refreshing. Doc is much more a father figure than a romantic interest, yet there are hints of romantic hint between them, but they are much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> Good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - such a show should have better special effects. And why don't they just use some cheaper effects, I don't know. In this day and age, SFX doesn't have to become a package - just look at Star Wars: Revelation fan movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
