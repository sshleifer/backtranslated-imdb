"Subspecies," as well as many other horror movies, is getting a rough deal on IMDb. Most movie watchers have horrible disdain for horror, and when they occasionally rent horror movies, they either want to laugh at them or cringe in too harsh scenes. Unfortunately, "Subspecies" is not particularly ridiculous and not so bloody, so it has a low rating. That's too bad. Of course there is a lot of criticism. Non-actors are flat, subspecies are bad special effects and night scenes are too brightly lit. But what do you expect? For direct-to-video horror film, "subspecies" boast decent production values ​​and more integrity than you might expect. The Romanian film environment is virtually unique (I believe it was the first American film made in the country, post-communism) and the places, both indoors and outdoors, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when immersed in local folklore (I'm sure all fake). Somehow, the place of filming and the clever script work well together - "Subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. The risk of damnation with weak praise ... it could be very stupid. Fans of horrific aspects of horror will undoubtedly get a kick from a bloody vampire villain, Radu. In this movie, it is very effective - powerful, with an unforgettable loud voice - but I like it better in its sequels when actor Anders Hove gives more parody, campsite performance. The very honest Council is somewhat stupid. Other stupid aspects include gratuitous nudity and subspecies, which are clearly in the film, because producer Charles Band has a fetish for the evil little creature (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). on film shortcomings. For what it is - the vampire video horror - "Subspecies" is perfectly fine. The sequel boasts better production values, more violence and somewhat more thoughtful storylines, so I recommend them even more. But it's not a bad start for the show.
