Kar Wai Wong is an incredibly impressive romance that is perfect for me. Set in 1960 in Hong Kong. As we have shown, it is set in turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Moan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet in a Hong Kong apartment where they both move. Chow MoWan works for a journalist company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after they both find out their wives, continually commit extramarital trials. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are nothing less than amazing. Both Leung and Cheung succeed in striking such amazing chemistry among themselves, it is better than any Romanesque love that is released today. Combined. The film is about focusing two leaders and their feelings for their partners' disbelief. Kar Wai Wong can create such a strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel them. Leung and Cheung are both wildly amazing, they are better than any Hollywood pairing displayed on the screen today. Combination. There is nothing more than to describe Fa yeung nin wa other than a beautiful, energetic romance that also contains a whimsical, atmospheric piece with a beautiful cameraman. So many elements of this movie will help create it flawlessly. Like Kar Wai Wong and Acting, both cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is creepy. Beautifully underrated. Shots from Kar Wai Wong help your mind to create your own world. The world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This movie is incredibly memorable. Costumes created by Karel Wai Wong regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who has an elegant, deep ankle dress in every scene. He's a scene thief. Her costumes say a lot about her nature and emotion is set in all her dress colors that are lively and cleverly used. Highly original. Chang, also a production designer, creates a brilliant environment for moody movies. Especially with the help of wonderful music used in scenes and masterful film editing, again Chang. It seems that William Chang is incredibly versatile and is an impersonal hero for this movie. Overall, this film is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly impressive and full of nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and scary. Kar Wai Wong turns out to be a master at the top of his game. Playing; music; cinematography; editace; Production; costume and direction all help to create ONE small, small perfect movie. A masterpiece in romantic filmmaking. Visually spectacular. Overall, the masterpiece of the film. A film that reminds me of an old classic Hollywood was the one that never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know not.
