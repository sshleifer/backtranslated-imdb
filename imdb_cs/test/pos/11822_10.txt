Incredibly close to real life feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophilic child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor. Although the story may seem far away (both boys try to navigate the river several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have a cure for AIDS), the emotions, actions and interactions of all involved are tragically close to real life. To be a "big brother" to a boy in a similar situation that died a few years after the film was released, I strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what is actually happening in the life of a child with AIDS. Peter Horton's excellent direction creates a perfect mood and environment for every scene and attracts the viewer to various emotions influenced by friendship, disease, prejudice and the last farewell of two friends who have fought hard to overcome adversity.
