Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is a film noir magnificence. This is mostly an unknown movie that all noir fans should see. sometimes. I love sharp black and white films noir movies.Film noir in color is not so good. Cast and screenplay is excellent. It's rather scary music is fun to listen to. Ida Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever have the grace I never saw producing that she was in that I didn't like. She was not only amazingly beautiful, she was a great actress. The first movie I remember when I saw Ida Lupino at the Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde I never forgot or even about the movie. I saw her latest movies as Food Of Gods and Women In Chains, and although the movies weren't her usual fare, she was still gorgeous as an actress.Howard Duff is always amazing to watch. all. I have this movie on VHS tape.
