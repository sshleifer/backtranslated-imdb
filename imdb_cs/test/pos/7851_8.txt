I was impressed by this early performance by Clint Eastwood. I didn't read the movie summary when I decided to watch it on TV. Because of Mr. Eastwood, I expected some nice shooting and no deep story. I was quite wrong. I found a few topics that were unusually explicitly addressed, and until the end I couldn't think about who was good and who was bad. This movie is definitely not a typical Eastwood, but it's definitely worth watching.
