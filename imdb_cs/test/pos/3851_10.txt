Oh my God!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! It's so incredible ...... I loved it as a small child and still love it as an adult. It's my favorite Disney movie allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch, watch and love it. My friends and I watch it tonight ..... It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend to anyone who is a child or a child in the heart. My favorite part is the song number and dance with all the stray and Thomas O'Malley. Writers / producers / directors absolutely nailed it ..... yeah, nailed it to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
