This movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The next day I recalled this movie on TV. She came back to me like a dam of the dam. I've never been more affected by film than this. After the movie I couldn't stop crying for about 2 hours. No movie ever moved me before. I was 15 at the time of the movie and I didn't see it, but I hope I can find a copy to buy so I can watch it whenever I want. If someone suggests you see this movie with them, GO .... you won't be disappointed. Peggy Fries
