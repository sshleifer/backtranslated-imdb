A smart and well-earned movie is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exposed and really intelligent film shot entirely in Bogota, you can feel the overall meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian film, the title is in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who found his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal), who has an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of the magazine; after this Nicolas is without a girlfriend and without work. Nicolas Revenge of Mallarino lies in his following and acquiring his photographs with his new affair Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) blackmailing Mallarino to raise money for change so as not to display Margarita photographs. The story is really intelligent and closely related, to the extent that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the film shows a thriller with lots of comic scenes and characters, resulting in a real pleasure for someone to enjoy movies focused on a good script. I excel here that this film is different from typical Colombian films that show the dark and violent image of our beautiful country, something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show a Colombian type of life, so it could take place in any part of the world, I disagree: (1) the film is shot in Bogota, so you can see the streets and images of the real Colombian capital ( I hope that some American people and film producers watch it, so they stop showing the Amazon jungle or Mexican towns in Bogota as on some Hollywood movies), (2) characters, dialogues, accents (with the Exception from Nicolas, Argentina) are Absolutely from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has an accent typical of Cali, (3) you can also see social and cultural differences from ordinary people in Bogota. I hope all of this, along with the English title, will relocate people from other countries to watch this masterpiece of Martinez. \ T Ricardo Perez and Mallarin, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A movie that is worth exporting and that people around the world will surely understand and entertain!, Don't miss this movie 9/10!
