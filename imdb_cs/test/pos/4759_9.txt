I was born in '68 with not much parental guidance I watched on television (as a child in the 1970s). I have always loved this movie (and the French connection), and I have always tried to catch it whenever it was on the spot (a Sunday TV guide in advance). I bought it on a DVD a few years ago and I watched it twice since and I have to say I still love it !! Roy S. was a great 70s actor (Jaws is one of my everyday favs, Marathon Man, etc.) And although 7 pieces aren't a movie that would be a good Oscar, he gives you exactly the time (NY). , in the early 70s, as well as French Connection) and gives you some tough characters and a look at life as a cop at that time. And yes, persecution is one of the best times.
