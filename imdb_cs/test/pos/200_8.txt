For a long time I wanted to watch this romantic drama (with WWII setup) and now that I can, I can only say that it is a real masterpiece of Russian film! Soviet movies are known for their enthusiastic propaganda approach, but fortunately it is without this emphasis - with a firm focus on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a lively girl, a condemned focal point of war for which he volunteers but from which he will never return. The girl (a remarkable performance of Tatyana Samojlov√°) is also loved by a young man's cousin, and if he doesn't get a word from his friend, he gives it to him and takes it. But he is an aspiring concert pianist of the bitter war that has limited his chances of success, and since she knew the girl is still dedicated to the soldier, she begins to neglect her. Finally, the word reaches the girl of her loving death, but at the end of the film she learned to accept it as a sacrifice to her native country and is content with her life with her memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film has a truly amazing camera experience that allows extremely deliberate use of screen space, and by often receiving tracking, tilting and high or low angle shots, it makes great power for the evolving emotional drama. The individual sequences are equally impressive - especially two: a stunning scene, frenetically modified and sped-up in shoes, in which the girl rescues an abandoned boy from trampling the truck; and the premature disappearance of a young man in an unfortunate incident at the front, undoubtedly one of the best of his kind I've ever watched (with the sun leaving him, symbolizing life that seeps out of his body as he imagines a wedding day will never have!) . Also notable, however, is the scene where the girl goes looking for her parents in her home that was hopelessly devastated during the raid; as well as her last violent surrender to a concert pianist - who is trying to resist repeated bangs in the face - in a later raid and particularly effective use of the fluttering set! Disappointed, the DVD of this extraordinary film is a problem with bare bones (RusCiCo contains several add-ons, but since it is an export, it tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to the start!); The criterion released him in conjunction with another Russian classic war, BALLAD OF SOLDIER (1959), which my local DVD renter told me. The only other film I watched from the director of the Arctic epic RED Tent (1969; though through a much shorter American version!), Star International production based on real events; Because of the unmistakable artistic quality of CHRISTIANS, they are FLYING, I regret that on my famous documentary film I AM CUBA (1964) I was missing several times when I was in Hollywood last year: in addition to having a weekly drama, I was shown more than once on TV accompanied by the feature "Making Of" !!
