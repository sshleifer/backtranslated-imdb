Sheba Baby, is another Pam Grier Blaxploitation movie. It was one of Pam's less visceral films of this genre. Pam plays Sheba Shane, who is a Chicago hop. Seb's father owns a small credit company in Missouri. When local gangsters try to run their father's business, Sheba goes after the bad guys. Pam Grier has already made a mark in Blaxploitation movies when Sheba Baby arrived. Fans of both Coffy and Foxy Brown know that Pam is capable of explosive intensity as an actress. Sheba Baby, the fiery performance that viewers expected from Pam, was not so evident in this movie. Not that Pam didn't dig in Sheba Baby. She is simply not so much of the runaway-train vigilante, as she was in her previous Blaxploitation movies. The supportive cast in this film is a disappointment. So Sheba Baby is Pam's film, through and through him. And even though Pam is somewhat more subdued than in his other films, Sheba Baby still gives impressive performance. This movie is definitely worth your time if you are an avid fan of Pam Grier.
