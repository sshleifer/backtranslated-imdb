This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. To get started, standout performances are from beautiful Debra Paget as a princess / dancer, from Michael Rennie as a villain, a handsome young Jeffrey Hunter investigating a crime in his city / state and more. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess rehearse a dance that later performs (once). Before she knows she's on her side, she manages to peg. Travilly's photographs, costumes, Lionel Newman's music and film style are unusually fine. Add to this exciting action, intelligent characterization and gentle driving by veteran Harmon Jones from the 1249 AD Gerald Drayson Adams script, and you have the pleasant Grecianized Near-Eastern ingredients. However, there is much to praise the unusual and well-developed story, because there is much more than praise that differs from the fast pace of film, well-controlled physical action sequences, and superior technical aspects. Classically trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly found in one "B" movie; There are no fascinating sets, different locations, and the secrets of quality that come with it. One way to evaluate the film is: "If I were guaranteed to live through this experience, would I take these events and perform these actions?" Since my answer is a stunning "yes" in this case, it remains this film is one of my options as a favorite and very underrated film production. It could be that all critical American critics, who are too often a contempt for women, as warriors and thinkers who, as in many other cases, have caused closed minds to convey the apparent anti-tyrannical and pro-entertaining character of a film that can be estimate?
