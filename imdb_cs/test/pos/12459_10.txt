The biggest Tarzan he ever did! This film is done so that no other Tarzan has ever come close. It has everything you want in Tarzan. No other Tarzan movie ever has or will ever distort this character. I would say that if you saw Tarzan and liked it, you should see this one you will love, and if you have never seen Tarzan, you should see it and forget the others.
