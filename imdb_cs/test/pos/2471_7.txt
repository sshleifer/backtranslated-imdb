The strengths of the film were clear for the beginning and middle of the film. It turned out that a very violent, reactive authority could react to resistance. The director filmed the documentary and captures what would happen if the United States adopted martial law. Volunteering for the "punishment park", a police training ground where you are harassed and harassed, would offer you this scenario. Switching between lawsuits for those facing charges, those in the park who escape police attention, training officers who are preparing to work with these prisoners, judges in leisure, among many other things. It was a very strong, deeply moving film. The only mistake I had was his realism. Officers are often seen to keep their pistols as they were seven years old with a plastic toy (ie 90 Â° bent elbow when pointing the gun in one's face, or as one cop only makes it look like it's hard to kick someone when they 've got it) \ t etc.). It starts as an honest and interesting attempt to capture the very critical state of political affairs. By the end of the film, the viewer is slowly and again reminded of the prejudices of the director and producers. Antagonist characters in the story begin as real, real human beings and then slowly get into "stereotypical, objective, evil forces" to the very end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the force they demonstrate is unreal, and unlike what real police action does, judges are faced with stupid and unreal mistakes during this trial, among many other things. The movie began to crumble when it turned out to be just another attempt to control the government to look bad. And that comes from anarchist. The scenes at the end became hockey, unreal and thousands of times too dramatic. For the former, however, it promises a very moving story.
