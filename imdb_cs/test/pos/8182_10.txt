The film invites comparison with Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and spoken, and the plot is complicated and interesting. Gong Li never looked better, never had better representation of China on the screen. The balance between political turmoil and personal intrigue that the Gladiator has hinted at but has never really been delivered to is in the spade. Just incredible.
