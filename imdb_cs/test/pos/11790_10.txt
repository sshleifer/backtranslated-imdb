I thought this film was excellent, unpredictable, and different from the normal run of a mill "off-line serial killer." Kiefer Sutherland was brilliant as usual - I really don't think I saw anything he did where he didn't act brilliantly. Dialogue was funny at a time when the mood and conspiracy were refreshing. I would like to thank the other reviewers for having shown a connection with Alice in Wonderland - I did not answer them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Kiefer Sutherlands fan (like me) and anyone who wants to watch a fun movie for a few hours. It was a pity that it wasn't released in cinemas for a wider audience.
