I've never read any Sarah Waters novels, nor have I seen Tipping the Velvet. I only heard about Fingersmith when I went through the "L word" website. The story of Fingersmith intrigued me, but I handed it over, thinking that "a lesbian in a Victorian period that never ends well, I have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go nowhere" <br /> <br /> However during Christmas my local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought a DVD, and my life was never more colorful <br /> <br /> This mini series deserves to be honored and praised. Acting is so great that I call it rare. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and many others I can't name have brought light and darkness to their characters. Only with a small gesture, a small look, a little breath, their characters were real, and as a spectator I couldn't help but take them home, keep them close. Fingersmith, a set in the Victorian area, is the story of a Sue-thief who loves and lives with his pick-caps family. Little did she know that her fate was associated with Maud Lily â€” a rather shy, shy girl who grew miles and miles away from Mansion. Maud's mother left her fortune, but Maud couldn't touch her if she didn't marry. The worst of all is that Uncle Maud will make sure she never leaves her trapped in the house. You enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming, good-looking thief with a heart as bad as anyone. She wants Mauda's wealth for herself and, to do so, builds Sue as Maud Lily's maid and asks Sue to talk to him. as time goes by, Things would be easy if Sue didn't love Maud. And that would be easy if the story was what I just said. I don't want to go wrong, so I want to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is twisted and rotated before you can be aware of what happened. Once this happens, you ask what happens next. In addition, the story is filled with passion, unlike others. There are no self-exploration, sexuality questioning, "Oh my God I love girls" moments because the girls at Fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they will barely be able to care. the story with such a twisted plot moves as smoothly as water, runs passionately, but strangely calm. Weeks have passed since I watched "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes are still haunting me, and Sue's words keep warming my heart "You pearl, you pearl, you pearl," she said. And such a pearl is.
