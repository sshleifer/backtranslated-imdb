For those of you who were interested in what an art monster might be, no wonder. The DAIMAIN Trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. More period samurai epics than anything else, these three movies are also becoming part of one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There is no single aspect of these gems that is unpolished, from scripts to the creator's performance. Even special effects are handled with above-average skills and integrated (in most cases) almost seamlessly into film (s). If you're a GOJIRA fan or a samurai fan or one of us who likes a good movie regardless of genre, I recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
