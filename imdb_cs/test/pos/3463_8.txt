It is rare that I have the opportunity to review an IMDb movie that is so closely related to my own life. However, as someone who lives with cerebral palsy (though less severe than Michael, one of the main characters in the film), I do not want to give this movie a "free pass" just because it deals with a subject that is rarely addressed; and when it is, it is normally treated by the face of seriousness. There were minor problems I had with the film; and I would like to turn to the first ones to make sure that this is not my situation that would obscure my judgment on this great movie! * Parts of what I felt were incredibly crowd-pleasing, at the expense of realism. If I had every time a well-minded member of the public mentions an electric wheelchair, I'd be much richer. But speaking in person, it fits more closely with the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than with the reality of what is going on. The same thing that spends time watching disabled people in a pub - that's not a big deal for those of us who actually do it, just as it can be admirable for strangers looking inside. Michael; but I still think he'll be more focused on enjoying the experience than thinking about what's in the first place. The time we spend when we look at them felt a little too much. I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease had been brought to our attention too late; This means that it has just been used as a cheap sentimental device to come between a couple rather than something that everyone knew would have to be resolved. To balance these criticisms, I need food praise. Although I thought some of the scenes that showed them how to cope with normal life were touched; The scenario has also embarked on some tricky places that I would not expect, and comes with great credit for it. For example, the issue of love and relationships; and showing a daily facility often used to help and help the lives of incapacitated people. Despite the dull tactics of the emotional shock of death that has come upon us, the film as a whole is far less satisfied than anyone has the right to expect that this type of film will be. Brenda Fricker can and can make a variation of her role on autopilot for what seems to be years; but Robertson and McAvoy share the special interaction that needs to be noted. Inside I am making roundabouts that somewhere a group of people has finally made a film that justice to the desire for the lives of many disabled people.
