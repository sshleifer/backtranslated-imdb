this makes me mistaken about criticism and their opinion. Usually I take what critics say about the movie, in most cases before I see the movie. However, I saw it without knowing anything about it. mainly because of the cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle are the two most respected and in my opinion the best actors alive. And Ryan Gosling is on the fast escalating way there too. His reality and humanity, which emanates in most of his portraits, makes viewers truly believe in character and what is happening to him. She's really my favorite generation of my generation. I have always found Yen Malone quite cute, since Donnie Darko, and if he decides to do similar roles then the heck I don't complain. <br /> <br /> back to my point. This movie really made me move. I believed it. acting was the highest class. as would be expected. actually the film left the audience with the ultimate goal of good film; reflection and reflection that follows the final credits. I think I have to follow it again to decipher how this film was critically attacked. I know their reviews must be accepted with a hint of salt. at least now I know.
