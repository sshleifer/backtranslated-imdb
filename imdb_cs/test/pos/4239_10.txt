GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in the movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Before Chucky died Tiffany and he was together. But like ten years later, Tiffany gets Chucky back (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie! Scary and definitely funny (just because Chucky!) 10/10
