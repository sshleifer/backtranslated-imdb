I really appreciate what Jung-won did before his death. All. I mean, his choice for love is selfless. If he chooses Da-rim, it will be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Of course he doesn't want it to happen. As he did in the movie, he decided to give up. So it was just a temporary suffering for Da-rim. As a comparison, My Life Without Me is very different. Their behavior shows a great difference between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can't say what's better. Everyone can choose the right. It is up to you. Life is the same for everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if you think it is appropriate for you. In fact, the slow pace of the film cannot be an excuse for rejecting the film. Just calm down. Get more from the movie. One of Korea's best movies I've ever watched. 9/10
