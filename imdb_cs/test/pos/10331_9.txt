This film should be easily qualified as a movie <br /> <br /> that best fosters human understanding between people. It may be somewhat unpleasant to try to understand that a young Jewish southern girl could shelter a refugee German prisoner of war. Kristy McNichol portrays an amazing portrait of an unhappy young girl who longs for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine performed a remarkable performance as her heavy father and Esther Rolle, because Ruth's maid, who boasted about these events, gave outstanding Emmy-victory performance. who is probably not guilty of Nazi atrocities. So does his role. He escaped, but joined the German army and could be a member of Hitler's youth movement. The event takes place in 1944 in Georgia in a rural area. The townspeople are filled with prejudice. Even the FBI inspector looks like he wants to get something on Jews. Note the opposite interpretation that as McNichol is in bed, Davison is hunted and eventually shot. Interestingly, McNichol considers a traitor who holds a prisoner of war escape. The film also deals with the very complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. Constantine's explosion at his daughter's end is some acting performance. As mother, Barbara Barrie, has little to do. It was unpleasant to be stereotyped as a typical Jewish mother with a loud lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorably made and well worth seeing.
