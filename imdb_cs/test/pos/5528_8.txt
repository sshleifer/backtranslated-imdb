I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - it's only about 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence that made it famous in vaudeville, and a few other great moments. They are also reusable for 55 minutes, thankfully Charlie Ruggles, who acted as banker J. Pinkham Whinney. It's the foil of everyone. She stutters and stumbles over our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. Joining the proceedings is George Burns and Gracie Allen. The Boland is especially entertaining near the start and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles consume most of the image. Gracie is funny, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I remember laughing with him once (although he has one great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles is desperately trying to get George to marry Gracie and leave him with his wife and one day with Fields where he asks Fields) his sweater, the piece is exclusively Fields. ' The situation is always funny: Whinneys go to California, but to help them with spending, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
