I know it was a goofy movie, but I enjoyed it. It's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "Bill Murray." I almost always like underdog movies, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count on. It's a generally kind movie - some adults aren't wrapped tight, but laughter is accepted rather than brutal as so many teen movies these days. Rich children beat the lake, but no one I know cared. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the pieces and tricks were true. They were occasionally even underestimated, but I'm sure it was an accident. The cast played well when Bill Murray showed advice on what would happen. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but, hey, good goofy laughs should be appreciated these days, but then ... it just doesn't matter ... ............
