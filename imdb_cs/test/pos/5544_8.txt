Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are in this screwdriving comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was a star at the time the film was made, is a horror. Dean Stockwell, in John Gotti's mission, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as a paranoid and above average Connie steals the film. Jonathan Demme, formerly known for his crazy comedies as "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard", reaffirms that he is a genius. I wasn't surprised at all when he won the Oscar for "The Silence of the Lambs". They are inspired by performances that evoke from their actors in "Married", and viewers set off for a wild and woolly ride. One of the cutest, most interesting films of the 1980s, stands on his head and shoulders over the many satires of his era.
