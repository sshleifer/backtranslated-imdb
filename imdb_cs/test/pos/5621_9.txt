David Lynch made his first Erasurehead movie in a few years and added new scenes every time he got a little more money. Kevin Smith made 'Clerks' at work while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that 'From Dusk Till Dawn' costs exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And what if an aspiring filmmaker not only had such a job, but also had all the ambitions of such lights, and all the dorkishty Smith, but absolutely none of the talent. Such a character is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary that records his attempt to create a few movies for many years. Borchardt connects his crazy dreams with years of depression and the deadly inability to say that day; one of the senses almost prefers endless work in finding the impossible perfection of accommodation with reality that it is simply not (on the basis of the evidence presented in the "American film") very good. And as a modern day, Ed Wood surrounds himself with an epic crowd of comrades, his true affection for whom he is his greatest redemption function. The collection includes his fighting parents, his best friends (one criminal, the other reformed addict), his own unfortunate children and the best of all his Uncle Bill's ages. Bill can live in an outboard park and just give up his life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 for accuracy) and a moving but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film. Borchardt manages to get several actors to play (side by side, of course), but basically he is completely dependent on friends and family to finish his job (even Bill plays a part in the camera). On British television, the BBC brilliantly planned a screening of 'American film' back-to-back with 'Lost in La Mancha', Terry Gilliam's story is a fateful attempt to film 'Don Quixote'. In that movie, one was overwhelmed by the huge amount of professionalism on display (inadequate as it was to task in hand), and how damn hard it is even for professionals with millions to spend making a film; whereas Borschad is not only worthless, but also a clown that cannot properly pronounce the name of his own work ("Coven"). Finally, Borschadt is pretty human to want him to succeed, but horrible enough for the viewer to still laugh at his failures. If this movie were fiction, you would dismiss it as incredible; but as it is, it is one of the most entertaining documentaries you will probably see.
