(May contain spoilers) I myself am disappointed with the criticism of this film. Although it is certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given. Acting and photography are excellent. Some music numbers are great; including title number, "Where Should I Go?", "Easy to Be Hard", and "Black Boys / White Boys". Even though I haven't seen the musical on stage, I think it draws many times. This is not a musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical could be sensational to watch, but it would never have the same effect on the film, so a conspiracy had to be added. And the end that was added is just amazing. The film left me feeling that I was actually watching something important, unlike most of today's movies, which only satisfy one level.
