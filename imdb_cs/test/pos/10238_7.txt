What's Fun at Barker's Nightbreed is that it's a man's story of rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this, monsters (night breed title) are "good" guys. They share their sense of celebration of various, twisted and dark with the first movie Addams Family and the great work of Tim Burton. He also has the goriness that one expects from Barker. Especially fun is the introduction of Cronenberg as a truly evil human doctor trying to destroy Nightbreed. As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the castle monsters with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern environment will replace the castle with an old mausoleum and rustic "weapons" with weapons and bombs. And this time, the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill, the center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting and certainly more cooling, work. But it is pure fun, looks great and remains light without laughing. Worth a look!
