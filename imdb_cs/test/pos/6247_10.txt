OK ... I've seen almost everything .... and some are considered classics that shouldn't be (like all those Halloween movies that suck crap or even Steven's King) ... and some are considered just OK, which they are really great ..... (like carnival souls) ........ and then some are just ignored ............ like (bad ed) or (pumpkin head and brain dead "bud cort one") then stick somewhere in the head once seen and never leave ........... this is what it did to me ........ and for my money is it much better than the last house left ............ the last house was great till the end ... then it blew up the bits ..... what kind of dummy will put a blow on someone who just killed Our children ????. Totally silly ..go find a movie "tyrant" or even "funny games" if you want realism and be sneaking out ......... but that damn thing took me years to come ....... .. one cause chuck Connors was always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever ..... ... three chick it's one of the worst killing on the movie ...... .. and 4. telekinetic power that bothered me and came utterly unexpected ....... not to mention the figures of wax puppets etc ....... it should be right there with the psycho, the last house, the Texas motor saw, etc ....... is classic .............. and deservedly ...........
