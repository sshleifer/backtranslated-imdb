Well, I'm a few days late, but what the hell ...! By the way, the word that best describes my reaction to "See No Evil" was ... SURPRISE. The movie is actually pretty good. There is definitely enough blood, gore and action in the film with a slight amount of tension. It hearkens back to good ole 'slasher days in the late 70s and early 80s. Do you think "Madman" meets Leatherface with the Norman Bates dash and you will feel good about this movie. While the SNE is thin for conspiracy (most horror movies), it is something that will do the violence / killing methods, gore, tension and the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The film's name comes from the fact that Jacob pulls his victims' eyes with his fingers and puts them in big glasses. Why?? Just look at it and see it (pun). There are some movie elements that are raised from other horror movies, especially Psycho, TCM, & Madman, but they are not obvious. Finally, SNE doesn't really go to the territory we haven't seen for a long time, and SNE is not "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but he certainly deserves an imo look.
