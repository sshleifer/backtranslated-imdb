For starters, I did another film research. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and starred in this very imaginative and other film crime film noir. Second, it was a very low budget film, created in the renaissance of the main moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where they attempted a robbery are real jewelers. Rififi producers have asked them to be surprisingly filming their films (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "Surprisingly, for some obvious reason, they were delighted with the idea that film crime is taking place in their business.) It is a perfect character and conspiracy that fits into such a beautiful environment with the surroundings to add to my praise, I say it, some might say it was a typical Hollywood movie, just the opposite. Laslty, I'd like to say that I support this new film idea, where not only one party wins, and that party doesn't always have to be good, because I can say the movie isn't predictable!
