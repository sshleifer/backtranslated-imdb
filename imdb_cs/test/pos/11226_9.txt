The strong, cool landscape of the Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains beside the barren plains, is poetically exploited in this Lynchian fable / slide show on the death and melancholy of young and talented Polish brothers (who had previously been treated by bizarre and fascinating independent film fans) "Twin Falls Idaho" - a film about a young woman who falls in love with two brothers who are Siamese twins, a little orphan dies and the city is going to flood in the name of progress (damned and hydropower). score, minimalist dialogue and character development, and miraculous fantasy sequences, with very unique angels, focused on what every good film artist knows about, what film should be about, moving pictures ... pictures, scenes. images of deep beauty captured on celluloid e scary images can persist in your mind and wash over you as you drift into sleep. The fact that all this has been done in a shoe budget that is less than $ 2 million gives Hollywood a shame with their inflated film and hollow film costs and shows something spectacular about what will come from Polish brothers in the future.
