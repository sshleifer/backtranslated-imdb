This is perhaps the TV series with the greatest potential of any series. The production values ​​are in their own class. The characters are rounded and interesting. That's the best fun. Some of the aliens are quite grotesque, but there is a basic humor that makes it unacceptable. I hope this series will take many years and will have many spin-offs. Science fiction has its bad press, some are justified, but that's really the science fiction flagship and I thank Henson for it. Best Brands.
