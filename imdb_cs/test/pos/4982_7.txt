Violent men are pretty good Western, which certainly benefits from its excellent cast. Edward G. Robinson is a large ranch trying to squeeze out a smaller ranch one of them is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to calm his fianc√© (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next. Barbara Stanwyck is, along with Robinson's scheming wife, the role she has specialized in. Dianne Foster plays her daughter who comes to admire Ford. Violent men are nothing but a "B" conspiracy with "A", but it's very well done.
