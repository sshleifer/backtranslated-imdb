The first thing you see in this movie is the static angle (the one that will be repeated in the movie), showing the chaos going (invisible to the audience) in the studio that broadcasts the news. Shortly thereafter, a typical Fonda story appears at the same angle. Don't let it mislead you; the film is not about a reporter, a woman trying to succeed in a man-dominated profession. This is just a head start, a way to start a movie (though it is used later). The real point of this production is gradually revealed and the first thing we see is in a deliberately long scene. The whole movie has this pace; it is not slow or exhausted, but deliberate. It is never really fast, even in several sequences that would normally be expected. This stimulation (especially because it seems to be slowing down because the plot is revealing because the disturbing, disturbing nature of the film is falling apart) is strong for the viewer, almost painful. This inspires you, if possible, to jump on the screen, grab the people responsible for the collar and scream at them to do something, fix the situation. I never felt like I stood up for a moment or even took my eyes off the screen. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and is perfectly solved here. No excessive dramatization (as well ... very little, as well), just a precise presentation of the problem. The direction is overwhelming. Empathy for Lemmon's nature is profound. The cut is masterful ... one scene almost at the end illustrates it perfectly. The editor, judging by his filmography, is extremely underestimated. Writing was excellent. Acting was great, especially Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). Lack of score is perfect; no music is needed to improve. The end is noble and effective. The film has several negative points ... among them some of them are, of course, undeniably predominantly expositions, one particular part of the film, though dramatic, does not seem to fit into what follows. Not everyone will watch the movie because it has two features that are commonly (and rightly) attributed to bad movies; stimulation (which can be mistaken for slow) and (lack) score. You could argue that this is a negative thing, because everyone should consider the points they present, but maybe it's better; manipulating a heavy object with intelligence and respect (for both theme and viewer) ... something like that, maybe it shouldn't be fed with a spoon. I was fascinated by the film and left it astonished. I recommend it to anyone who believes he's strong enough to handle it. 9/10
