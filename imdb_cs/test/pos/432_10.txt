I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised, even from a classical director. This movie is beautiful. The shots are like oil paintings with a movement that many directors try, but Renoir MASTERS. I can't say how much this movie goes ... it's not really a musical, it just has a couple of well-placed music numbers and a big dance finale. But there's something about this movie that makes you feel the absolute pleasure of watching. I'm a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. Very easy to turn off things that are too happy or la la land, but this movie has a tremendous positive energy that is just irresistible - not to mention that every picture is beautiful and the story is good. 10 of 10.
