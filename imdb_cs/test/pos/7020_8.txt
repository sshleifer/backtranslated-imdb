Dirty Dancing - I think everyone saw this movie at once. I remember as a kid I loved this movie and watched it over and over without tedious. with performance. Swayze and Gray create the atmosphere of this movie, even though they say they won't, the chemistry in the movie is incredible! As the film goes on, we are drawn into their relationship, and we believe in each of their actions. The soundtrack is amazing, the music just adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby & Patrick. The last scene does this movie. can sometimes forget the famous line "Noboby puts Baby in the corner." The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone at any age, it's just a fun movie that everyone can enjoy 8/10.
