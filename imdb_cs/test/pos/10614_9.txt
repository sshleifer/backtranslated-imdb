I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and I still remember how much I loved it. it really touched me, and I thoroughly enjoyed noel coward working in it. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. I'm thinking about this movie from time to time, and I'm disappointed to have enjoyed so much revival as many classic movies. did not realize that I had seen it today that he won the Academy Award for Best Original Story for Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. Basically, it is an ugly character that destroys another's career and is cursed for it. he dies, but redemption is allowed if he can persuade someone to tear at him. much of the film shows him this goal. well written and beautiful. I knew him for his games so I was surprised to see him in this role on television late at night in New York. they must see if you ever had the opportunity.
