The Slasher sub-genre was quite much exhausted - in fact, even 1979, just one year after the supposed 'first slasher', Halloween (which was released seven years after the Blood Bay), was released; the sub genre was far from exhausted; but the tourist trap is one of the more original trips. The film has the same basic pattern as most slasher - ie, a freak kills a lot of children, but draws its originality from the fact that a freak is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible attacker or man in a mask) and we actually get insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic capabilities, including the ability to control wax figures that fill his house, increases originality. We are launching a great opening sequence that sees the young man fall foul when he found himself in a gas station. The scene is amazingly creepy because wax figures mock him and things fly out of the shelves - and it gives viewers a big look at what's coming; this is a very scary horror movie! <br /> <br /> Acting credibility is as non-existent as you would have expected since the 1970s, but to be honest; It's not that bad. Girls look hot, boys don't care; and Chuck Connors is more than fearsome in the role of psycho. Not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still, good enough. It is not an acting star of the show, but as expected - the terrible atmosphere will take this award. Wax models, such as the House of Wax (Vincent Price version), are very scary; and the film makes the best use of it. There are very few things in the cinema that can be scary by simply being there - but wax sculptures are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easily get into the atmosphere, but the film makes the most of it, even by taking things off the shelves and going well to the rest of the film. Overall, it's a very good movie. While tourist paste may not be absolutely necessary for tracking; it is worth seeing and I can recommend it.
