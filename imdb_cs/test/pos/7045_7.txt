Quintessential "let's get ready for a summer movie." It's stupid, goofy and maybe a touch dated, but my kids saw it and they laughed as hard as I saw it when I first saw it. In the style of all "little boys versus founding" movies, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. And no, it's not Bill Murray with his Bill Murrayest, but he is starting to stretch in his first starring role. Strange, however, see how a few "fresh young faces" in this film continued to do much more.
