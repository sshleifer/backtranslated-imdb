I grabbed it on local Mexican television at 2:00 am and decided to give it a chance because it is based on real life that deals with the murder of a typical American family (dad, mom and young son). ). At the beginning, the instructions point out that Walker is a murderer because he had strong differences with his father. Shortly after, Walker and Luke are taken to the sheriff's department. When lie detection machines are being investigated, things seem to be very different ... When Walker and Luke attend a meeting with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke gets $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. Anyway, it's a great mystery movie that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real names have been changed, but the experience is still the same. Try this movie. I know there are PEOPLE "based on real murders" or similar events, but this is really worthy. Net quality in action, direction and graph.
