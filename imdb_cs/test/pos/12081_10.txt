I saw this movie when it was broadcast on TV in February 1983. I was in the hospital and gave birth to my first and only child. I will not tell you to what extent I have been moved. Suffice it to say that the memory of the film has remained with me today, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this movie if that happened. Anyone who has ever seen it should remember this movie. However, I must admit that the fact that he remains somewhat obscure is fine for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret for me and for those who have moved it. I've never seen Mrs. Margaret play a better part. I've never seen her in a more convincing role. I will respect her forever just because I have taken such a beautiful part.
