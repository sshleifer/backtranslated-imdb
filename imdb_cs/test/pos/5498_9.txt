Quite simply a good, well-written and beautifully fiction film. Eastwood is classic as a grizzled secret service agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo <br /> <br /> holds her own as a partner (and love interest) to Lilly Raines. But the size of this film rests on John Malkovich's shoulders as "Booth". He captures <br /> <br /> this character's anger and hatred as well as his humanity oddly enough. <br /> <br /> I personally think it was his best performance and should receive an Oscar (but that year I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive anyway). Overall, a great movie to see that you want to peek into the mind of a killer and be <br /> <br /> on the edge of your seat all the way through. Enjoy!!
