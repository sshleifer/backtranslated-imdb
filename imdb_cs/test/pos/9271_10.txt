So absolutely unique and fun! Another great Canadian invention. Regular "Joe" (Dan) and a bunch of misfit delinquents (aka Puppets) all share a residence halfway down the house. His work is to monitor the four "threats to society" and help them rehabilitate. Bill, Murder Manikin, Rocko Smoking Dog Cigarette, Buttons, Nymphomaniac Teddy Bear and Cuddles Doll. Five of them find themselves in various special difficulties. Despite their murders and often apparently perverse sexual tendencies, it's hard to find them loving. I give this show 10/10 simply because it provides good entertainment without the need for a huge budget and radiates Canadian talent that makes me proud.
