This is the kind of movie that can bring you a nightmare, except it's a lot of fun. Hardware Wars are the only good fake game on Star Wars, other movies like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only good spoof movie I've ever seen, it doesn't tear Star Wars, it makes fun, and that's what's supposed to be spoofs.
