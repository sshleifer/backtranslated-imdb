He saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson took a huge chance to write an extremely heavy part for his first film and it paid off big in his cast of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she came from the theater, so I looked up her and ... a surprise, I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow her leadership, give up the expensive game classes and return to the theater, because only with this type of training will you be ready for such a ride. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and many of them), I can't stop talking to people about the masterpiece of Kelly Overton. We'll see LOT MORE her work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on the brave movie. Get it to the theaters so I can see all the people I wanted to see the ASAP movie!
