I loved this movie! Movies and games fulfill their purpose when they reveal social, political and other issues that affect the majority. This film served this purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the chart and know who it happened to. By the time this film was made, the concepts presented in this film were advanced to the public, yet it has already become my friends through people in strong positions. And I know what it's like when these people do what they did with Angela Bennett because they did it to me. I really wanted Sandra Bullock to portray Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. She portrays a pretty, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid crushing courses, struggle hard to keep her common sense and restore her life, and she tries to protect those she loves. The loss of self-conception and submission to this ancient attempt to support a slack self-esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger adds a touching touch of reality. The peak of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind of problem.
