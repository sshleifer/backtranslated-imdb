DO NOT USE DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). Definitely the best candidate for the craziest movie title ever created, and that's quite a success in Giallo-Land. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "Don't Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from its Italian title. The little character of Donald Duck is briefly introduced as a toy, but hardly to make such a title, but apparently has changed in fear of Disney's legal consequences. I stood up against Fulci's earlier LIZARD IN FEMALE SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients. A surprisingly effective secret, good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything just clicks. I think it is fairly celebrated as one of the director's most successful achievements. The story is built against the backdrop of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone kills young teenage boys. Among the suspects is the most obvious young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is suspiciously exposed by the child's skeleton and sticky pins. Guiseppe, a village idiot, is also suspicious because he was trying to get away from the disappearance of one of the boys and went straight into their trap. At a time when Newshound (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, local priest (Marc Porel) with a high position, and Patrizia ( Barbara Bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of a drug crime that also has sexual relationships with young boys in the city. Talk about your first-class red herring. Fulci contrasts nicely with the modernity and tradition of the newly built highway, which winds through the Sicilian hills, past old towns, where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. There could be a debate on the political attitude of the film as North versus South, or as a commentary on the small urban virtues - social conventions in general - which too often are dangerously close to overturning moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - itself. justice of the population. The film was often marginalized due to its anti-Catholic tone, but it is hardly an important element here, except for obvious reason-related reasons, which would be giving away too much. It's actually more tame compared to a movie like JoÃ«l Seria, NOT EVIL (1971). Probably, a somewhat unflattering portrayal of a movie of small Sicilian towns (when another boy is killed, the local population is referred to as a retarded lynch-crowd) could be the cause of some insult to Sicily, but - given Sicily's problematic relationship with others it would be problematic for Italy. The film went too fast in the dark to have the same influence. When you talk to Fulci, the amount of gore is usually the main subject of discussion. Although they lack eyes, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the rough final, a killer falls off a cliff and smashes his face down the rocks on the way down with terrible results (though not very realistic). The chain-whipping sequence with the Florinda Balkans in the cemetery shows Fulci's fondness for sadistic violence and typically does not adhere to a graphical representation of what most filmmakers would only suggest. Sure, one of the most frightening scenes in Fulci's repertoire. First of all, it is a tense, well-written, effective little secret that Fulci is nicely reflecting, with an impressive cast of genre regular personalities like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest). ), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkans (mouth-foamy crazy as a city witch). <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 8/10
