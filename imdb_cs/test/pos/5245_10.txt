I first saw The Big Trail in Vienna's Filmmuseum. Immediately, I was impressed by both images and high quality and unusual format. Who ever saw such a documentary western style with John Wayne? And there is so much time you can see on the screen, there is so much to see! One is always grateful that scenes are often static, because each shot is so well composed and you want to take it. Even hearing is good and fits well. The long run of the picture is amazing, you don't want to miss a minute!
