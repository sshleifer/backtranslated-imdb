Ingrid Bergman, playing faithful receptionist Walter Matthau, who has a little buzz on her boss, is absolutely amazing in this movie. She takes care of the funny repartee in the aplomb scenario and steals an amazing scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in the recording booth (Ingrid's monologue is front, but her face tells you she believes in it with her heart). Matthau is an indifferent choice for a leading man (too old for Goldie Hawn and too clumsy for Bergman, not to mention being too free to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tried to make Goldie happy and hang out when he tries to free himself from lies. Hawn (who won the Oscar Support) is as fresh and lively as today. This bedroom bedroom isn't terribly sophisticated (and weakly reminiscent of one of "Any Wednesday" except), but it's a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies that turn out today. "Cactus Flower" is a beautiful sigh! *** of ****
