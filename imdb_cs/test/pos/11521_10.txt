I must say that this film had a great cast, places, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting role, very upset, while Jordana Brewster had a serious role but still capture one. for me Jordan is very nostalgic, reminds me of my female classmate! what really intrigued me in this movie was a very skillfully planned camera and site selection. The story is very thoroughly written. it needs to be seen. the one who is in mysterious movies should watch this, guarantee you that he will keep you in your chairs until the end.
