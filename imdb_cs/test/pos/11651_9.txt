This film is about a very delicate argument, and if you're looking for something to think of, you're right. Tim Robbins has done a great job and the result is a dock-drama that should be shown in schools (for strong topics). What about the actors? They're just great; Susan Sarandon is really a 'face of love' and Sean Penn is incredible as almost always. You must absolutely see!
