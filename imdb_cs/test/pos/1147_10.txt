The picture of Marines in this film is in place. Action scenes are some of the best ever made in content accuracy. The uniforms and armament of the American and German troops were perfect. Also the Berber costumes and armament were absolutely accurate. This movie could easily be used to teach militarie of that time and was used for the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt's shooting and the rifles he used were beautiful. The acquisition of so many contemporary weapons in such a good condition testifies to the attention and detail of this film. Millius is a genius.
