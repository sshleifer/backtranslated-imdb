Washing the Marion Marines "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, is thrown out of the boot camp after five weeks and is forced to put on the Baby Blue Marine uniform, which shows he just didn't. make a choir. Humiliated and despised wherever he went when going home to St. Louis and scared what his family, whose father was in the Marine Corps in World War I, would have thought of him that he could not "cut the Mustard" as a US Marine. Hedg, who had stopped at the bar and found himself sitting next to him, is a sea member of the intrepid and deadly seabreaker Richard Gere who buys beer in the admired hedge. Richard Hedge's conversation is shocked to find that he is not only sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he has fought, but also in the battle for the medals he has received, but completely gray hair and half thirty-looking Richard are about to be 21 next Moon! That's what they did to him in the Marine Corps and WWII! Buying a Hedge line of drinks Richard takes a drunk Baby Blue out and knocks him down with his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it on Hedge's ware. Once Hedge builds Richard's uniform that fits him perfectly, he is confronted with this big drunk American parachutist, who calls himself Cement-Head, who wants to fight Marine Raider. Hedge, who is doing everything in his power to avoid the trouble, is forced by Cement's head to crack him after he himself has broken two bottles of beer over the cement head to warm up for a great fit between Marine, Hedge and Paratrooper, Cement. Head. Ensure incredibly large cement flooring at the head of a buffon knocking him cold with one stroke! "I think the trick won't keep him on his head", stunned Hedge tells his, Cement-Heads, fellow G.I's. Tracking to this small town Bidwell Hedge Hedge this US military internment camp for Japanese Americans who are there because they are considered a threat to US security. It is later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone what the real hero he is, not who those people in the city think he is, by risking his life to rescue one of the hated "Japs" who thoughtlessly along with two of his friends escaped from Interment Camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving a Japanese American frightened death from drowning in dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught Bidwell people that not all "Japs", even those who are American citizens, are evil and treacherous banzai screaming suicide kamikazes like they were thought of by newspaper magazines and movies at the time thinking they were.

"Baby Blur Marine" is best not to be too politically correct in not showing heroes or leading actors and actresses in a movie that had the same feelings and ideas during World War II, as most people now have, which it became fake as three dollar bills, to those who watched a movie that lived during these historical and important times when the film was to take place.
