Originally I saw this movie as a VHS blockbuster. That was a long time ago, but it still remembered. The jerk doesn't have it anymore. Netflix didn't have a lot of copies on the web - just a few copies of VHS. Recently, he finally found a DVD available on eBay at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL on our NTSC TV). Wife and I enjoyed it. The film's style is a bit strong, and many, if not most, parts are rather heavily played as if amateurs (especially kids) did, but it's not annoying. Company contrasts are emphasized in the replay. There is a bit of political preaching when it comes to the fact that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not so great life, but instead have at least tried to do things better. But it's not dominant. Most of the time it's pretty funny. Some of them, who say to others, do not say it was IMO at all, I consider it a comment on the expectations of Russian characters. At least when it's from my western point of view. Maybe it's a West argument from a Russian perspective (which is literally the characters who say that). I can't say how literally true the movie is English subtitles. stating that the headlines were made very well, full of English idioms as if done a native English speaker - complete with "color" language.
