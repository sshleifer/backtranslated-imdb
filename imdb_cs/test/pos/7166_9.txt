This was an amazing little movie that was really creative and fun - something you see too rarely in movies. The film begins in Russia just after the fall of the communist government. As a result, the company seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. The dirty cities, crime and lack of housing are still disappearing from the poor people of St. Petersburg. An idealistic music teacher comes into this scene of desolation and uncertainty. He is among those homeless and he finally gets a letter from the government, which tells him he has a small room in a nearby apartment. When it comes, the place is a mess, but people seem to be friendly, so they all have a beautiful party. In the middle of the night, an old lady wakes up from a giant wardrobe in the room (half expecting Lucy and the other children of LION, LIGHT AND GARDEN to come out, but they didn't) t). They are too shocked to do as soon as possible, but soon they decide to investigate. Instead of a wardrobe, the wardrobe opens to Paris! As the dwellers respond to this magical gate, it is really interesting. Some, like a music teacher, are excited and astonished. Most of the others are more pragmatic and mostly deal with looting everything from Paris before the gate closes once and for all! These Russian thieves are terrible people - greedy, rude and rude, but deep down - VERY DEEP - are the hearts of gold. I like the way this is a metaphor for a nation now on the verge of capitalism. Initially running amok grabbing everything they can and only later revealing some depth - but mostly acting like guests at JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has many twists and turns and is funny and fascinating. The only negative is that because of some rough language and naked scene (though very funny) it's not a movie for kids. This is a real shame, as with some very minor modifications, it could have been a great family movie.
