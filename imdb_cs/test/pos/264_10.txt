He rented it from my local because it was the only new British movie available this week. I've never heard of a filmmaker before or his films (thank you IMDB). He did a good young British comedy for a while, which was not enough for Hugh Grant or forty something. The story is a story of morality, but never preached, truly pleasing from young and fresh cheeks. Luka Gosse's camera was surprisingly very good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. He loved the colors, especially in the nightclubs. Great music and a truly original voice at work. Nine out of ten worth a rental fee.
