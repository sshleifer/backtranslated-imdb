... this noire set piece suffers from a murky sound (at least as shown by the inadequate equipment of both film festivals in Seattle and Maine) and a more miserable drawing, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old sneakers and bag sweats. However, he has moments of stellar scenery of chewing, and the film offers a sinister ambiguity from Norman Reedus, quite Polly Walker, and a surprising ending (telescoped to frequent filmgoers), while providing a beautiful view of the physiography of both Maine and Rickman. In March, a video release (after wiring) took place. Don't miss any Rickman fan. Ignore the amanita hooey.
