Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau must be one of the best friends ever to work together. They've made a lot of movies together, I think they're both fantastic when they work together in a movie. The sea is a fantastic comedy movie that I think I watch. I'm giving a movie of 10 out of 10. Jack lemmon and Walter Matthau will remember when the movies they did together are on TV. Unfortunately, they will be omitted. God bless you both.
