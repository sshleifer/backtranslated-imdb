The Italian term "sprezzatura" was a grace and nonchalance in the social ways that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "The Courtier". "Hitch" is worth watching the rendition of "sprezzzatura" in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating adviser to those who are not lucky and trustworthy. The best scenes are when Hitch coaches painfully shy and maladroit Albert in his quest to win the heart of New York's socialite and in Hitch's own Sara attraction and surprise for her while visiting Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported by the good work of Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by the charm and amazing personality of Smith. From start to finish, Smith rises above the average comic scene to make "Hitch" an extraordinarily tangible and entertaining movie. I do not believe that today is another actor who is able to deliver charisma and perfect timing with comic moments like Will Smith in this movie. And his secret is in "sprezzatura"!
