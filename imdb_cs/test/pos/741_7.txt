Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), a seriously ill-equipped mental health institution, is approaching "treating" his patients with a "progressive" approach, even by allowing his loons to have complete freedom of the day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking, but when he foolishly prescribes cutting wood with an ax as a therapy for one of his patients, he then gets a neck swapped with a log (giving him the right not to weave on the basket). Shortly after this tragic event, Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to assume the position of a doctor's assistant and finds that the facility is now operating a much tougher Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Despite not being aware of his late predecessor's decision to recruit Mrs. Beale, despite being interested in new employees, Dr. Masters agrees to allow a pretty nurse to start working, but after a few torturous experiences in the hospital, Charlotte It starts to wonder if it will be Could be better if she was averted. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on in the hospital. it should be known to most experienced horror fans, but SF Brownrigg's Don't Look In The Basement still proves to be a fun piece of fun with its well-defined collection of nutters: lobotomised, popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who constantly mumbles the courtroom phrase; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites the crazy poem by William Allingham Fairy and warns Charlotte of impending fate; the nasty loon Danny (Jessie Kirby), looking forward to teasing other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr) who thinks her doll is a real child; Army Mats Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and the best of all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a number of men has left her with a desire for love (ie, she tries to jump on every man who goes near her). This convincingly crazy set of characters, plus a bit of gore and nudity, a sensible direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the formidable white scum of Earth), and a solid turn from Playboy covergirl Holotik, all turns out differently a somewhat predictable, low-budget piece of exploitation into a very attentive psycho shock.
