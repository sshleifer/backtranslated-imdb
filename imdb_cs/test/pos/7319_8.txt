Although it is not a huge fan, I am the three Stooges purist. I believe their best work was far from Curly as the third Stooge and their earliest films are generally their best. This is because after a while they began to transform their films and the gags began to become. Here, in 1934, they were still relatively fresh (more than one) and funny. Here boys play very unlikely roles - respected doctors in the hospital! Three running amok act silly, hitting each other and scaring the pants out of anyone who expects to improve. Non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must see for the fans. By the way, even though I liked this movie, I strongly recommend trying to find a much lesser known short from a small educational Pictures. NIFTY NURSES is just like MEN IN BLACK, but it can be fun and it's the best hospital comedy of the era - better than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
