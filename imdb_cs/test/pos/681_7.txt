Intense domestic tension with the house lover (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic refugee (Ryan). Two masters of this genre are in their heady, erotic best because they coincide with the wits, emotions and will in the bizarre situation of the hostages right from Saturday night. Richly photographed B&W photos with unusual close-ups. The young girl who teases Ryan is really well directed here. Unlikely but satisfying suburban melodrama.
