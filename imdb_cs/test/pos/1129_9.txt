I've been watching two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I'm not in college, I'm missing a wonderful college life. I wish I could spend a little more time with the community. I identify myself with rusty. When I rushed with my brotherhood, my big brother wasn't like Cappie at all, I wish I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people identify with the characters, then it's a pretty good show. It's more realistic than American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call it a younger version of "desperate wives"? Some writers must be Greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect a somewhat real fraternal life and alliance. It was taken in high resolution. And actually they were filmed outside in the studios. image quality is very good. They could easily have made a good movie. Unlike a movie that can only take a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun and watch it for free on TV weekly. Casting is excellent, actors are of the right age and are new and fresh, making them more real. This show is practically about everyone. Asian and black frat boys and girls are also at the show. It is almost a bit shocking that they had a small story about two guys in the fraternity had sex in the first episode, then tried to reconnect in the second episode. I don't think I've seen anything like that on television before. This show somehow reminded me of Warner Bro's TV show of teenagers called "Young Americans", which was canceled in early 2001. In that show, a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy, and the guy thought he was a male gay. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time students have to study for exams etc .; At a time when people have some free time in their lives, there is no fraternity for the association to join. I don't know how long this exhibition will last, sooner or later, these people will also have to "graduate" college. Maybe they'll find some new actors for the next 4 years of college fun life!
