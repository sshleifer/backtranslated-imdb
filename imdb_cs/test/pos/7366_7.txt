A good (not great) little high-factor horror movie "creep" (not to be confused with the 1991 movie of the same name, or later (2001) Campfire STORIES). The central story of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods leads nicely and combines the various stories that make up the bulk of the movie (Watch Ron Livingston (Office Space, Brothers Group) and Jennifer MacDonald. )). Fixed gameplay and a few truly "scary" moments make it an above-average cooler. A good example of an interesting story associated with a high-quality set that is larger than the sum of its parts. The "surprise" end of the main story adds a nice haunted twist, though some may see it come up. The movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
