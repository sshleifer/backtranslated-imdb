The outer limits are a brilliant show that leaves me with very strong emotions for the most part. There are, undoubtedly, some stinker-episodes, but it's basically an old pulp-comedian turned into a television show so it can be expected. Mostly it is well done, well designed and directed, and often lists some of the great talents that seem to work in a solid translation of a short fiction TV format. The external limits tend to focus on relatively large ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely end without vocal overlap of serious thinking. From time to time, topics are immersed in a little too strong environment. all except the strongest spectators. Although some mistrust of the government contributes to effective democracy, you can unfortunatelly catch several episodes that are absurd at the border of distrust of the army / CIA, etc. One more note is that every large power group (Roman Catholic Church, Evangelicals , the People's Republic of China and so on) is cast in bad light at a frequency from one to frequently. While the show can beat a dead horse if it is watched enough, overall quality is overwhelming, and I am grateful that Sci-Fi has decided to continue broadcasting until they produce a DVD season after the season (and I I can afford it).
