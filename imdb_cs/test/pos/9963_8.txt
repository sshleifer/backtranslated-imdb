Venice, in 1596. The news is separated from good Christians. Basanio, a young but poor Venetian loves the Portia Fair, which is a rich heiress. So he is approaching his friend, the merchant named Antonio, for three thousand ducats traveling to Belmont. design Portia.All ships and merchandise Antonia are busy at sea, so he turns to moneylender Shylock, one of the Jewish faith.Shylock doesn't like Antonia because he spat on his face.He offers Antonio a three month loan for no interest but if he doesn't pay Money at the time, will have its own pound of your body. Shylock's daughter, Jessica, is also dating Christian Lorenzo. The merchant from Venice is based on the play by William Shakespeare, who was believed to have written between 1596 and 1598. I read this game last summer and now I saw a film that was made by Michael Radford in 2004. I liked the game and disagree with the allegations that it is anti-Semitism. The Jewish character does not seem like an inhuman monster, even those Ough are ready to cut a piece of Antonio's meat. There is a lot of depth in his character, which comes from his speech, where he asks, "If you stab, don't we bleed?" There are many more people in Shylock than in one of Antonio, who spits on good Jew.Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. He gives such powerful performance. Jeremy Irons is also amazing as Antonio.Lynn Collins is also great. The most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia.Zuleikha Robinson does a great job like Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and does a good job. In the role of Neriss we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo.As in Shakespeare plays usually, this also includes the most brilliant dialogue.The film paints a fantastic portrait of the era.It deals with some great problems in the Shakespearian way.
