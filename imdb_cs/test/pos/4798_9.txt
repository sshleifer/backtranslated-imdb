This film is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's storytelling skills. It is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I don't think it was particularly funny, I laughed. The film, despite the fact that you can't ever take Bunuel too seriously, thought about religion and its importance in the lives of some people. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest devoted to his faith as no one else, and the viewer witnesses what happens when a priest's unwavering commitment to serving others is tested. Bunuel's goal is, as usual, Catholicism, but I don't think he was trying to taunt the church as he often does. At least I didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he's trying to take an interesting point about how religion could be difficult in today's modern society. Not because faith itself is bad, but because people always abhor the concept. Say it aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most successful works. Francisco Rabal is excellent as a priest. Definitely one of the best movie films.
