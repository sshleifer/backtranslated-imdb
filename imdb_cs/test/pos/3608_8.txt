To tell you the truth, I went to see this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People don't have to agree, but they do just as well in bad and good movies. I hadn't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I tried to find out if she's a good actress. So, here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (I didn't read the novel, however). Some moments were really exciting and unexpected. Overall, you'll find that the storyline is pretty simple. The only thing that could save the film, which (an experienced viewer would know from the beginning) would be either tragic or happy, was a performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was great, great, great! In the second part of the film I even liked the rather accented actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, it is fine and even looks like a Greek girl). Overall, the movie is very entertaining and has a lot of irony (fans of classical music will certainly have fun at some moments :) I'll give it 9/10. You should see it!
