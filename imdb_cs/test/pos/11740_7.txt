After many years, I saw this beautiful love story again, thinking about how I could, after half a century, respond to the film that so many girls did at the time to cry and sigh when I was just a male adolescent tried to understand the behavior of women in a small town in Brazil. This time, however, what captivated me in the film was something very different, and the insistence with which Dr. Doc. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) explains to Mark Elliott (William Holden) a special ethical condition as Eurasian. In fact, he constantly emphasizes this point in his relationship, reiterating that he is willing to take her love for him and carry it in a "secret way", provided he does not make his Chinese side. . The viewer feels that Suyin is impatiently trying to create a very subtle reconciliation between the two unstable and opposite aspects of his culture, as he immediately engages in an apparent conflict in her mind with minimal failure to control them. Why are Suyin's attitudes always left to poor Elliott? a determined, brave and extremely practical person? anxiety and confusion without knowing how important it is to give her words. For him, whose love for her is simple and simple, the situation is absolutely clear: if we love, let's make a couple and start immediately together. "Not so fast" is what seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time. In fact, Suyin's Chinese portion would never allow such a level of pragmatism. And as it goes on and strengthens this very targeted balance between the two worlds within itself, it often also signals that even a very special feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, the constant "raids" on the real world by invisible beings from the spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin, Elliott always warns of how dangerous life is, not for any objective and concrete threat (as if it was to maintain English colonialism or the eminence of the Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of a lot of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical creatures over the poor , terrible and vulnerable human beings. In fact, it seems that a whole group of Chinese deities are constantly on guard to make human life totally unhappy. For this reason, mothers must dress their precious babies in girls' clothes so that they are not carried by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to loudly emit clouds to prevent their vision from covering the moon; the peasants are instructed to shout loudly, "Rice is bad! Rice is bad!" protect your crops from alienation of the deity; and at the funeral it is recommended that the dead family be separated from other people by curtains, so that the gods do not enjoy their sadness and fragility. In other words, Suyin introduces us into a culture in which supernatural has a real existence, as if the somewhat disturbing pantheon of malignant and sadistic gods has always been on the verge of negative interference with most banal acts in everyday life of every person. As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was at that time an almost semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott originated was not yet dominated by wild capitalism, the US that launched the US after the first oil shock in 1973, took over the world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were even more innocent than today. A lot of history has arisen since the old days. As far as China is concerned, the main fact is that, after several phases of the communist regime, the country has finally reached a state of very aggressive economy over the past two decades, much more appropriately described as state capitalism. And what happened to the old spirituality that so impressed Suyin in Hong Kong in 1949, and with which the impression of such a vast Elliott, under this tree on the hill behind the hospital? He's gone, gone! In short, if this story happened today, Elliott would not consider it necessary to go to China to suggest Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men in their huge pragmatism would be incomparably closer, talking about business as usual!
