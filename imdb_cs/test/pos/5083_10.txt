I saw the movie yesterday and I was shocked, but even more shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim was tortured or not - that's why ... One person wrote that since he wasn't an American citizen, ... Some people comment that people in the Middle East Hate us and want us to be dead, so ... So we say it's right to torture someone who is guilty of crime? We say it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? We say it is right to torture someone who can hate us and want us to be dead? We say that, as stated in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the United States Constitution, "torture is bad, but some torture is less bad than others?" When will "right" torture become? That is why this film is powerful - it is ambiguous but not torture. Torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy", then we are wrong and we are evil; we do exactly what we blame our enemies for what we do (and we call them "wrong" in the same breath.) My favorite line in the movie was "if you don't want to compromise with Amnesty International." Brown.
