I have to admit that I liked this film, and I didn't consider it all. It could be a subtitle, three ways of looking at LiV Tyler. Three different men are obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters, one man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodman charcter, the character of Liv Tyler is the idealized Saint, the second coming of his sanctified wife, Theresa. For Paul Riesers' character (which tells the story to diminish (the subtle, undervalued performance of the great Reba Mcintire), the character of Liv Tyler is simply the object of a (idiosyncratic) sexual fantasy. All three of these obsession stories are narrated at the same time and all are fun, finally the movie ends in a bizarre humorous climax that I didn't want to give away.
