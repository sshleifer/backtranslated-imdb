This is a nice movie. It's very realistic to the "wonderful world of music" I've been there and done it. It shows the human element in every character and realism that nobody is perfect. These amateur musicians were not all so bad players. Cleaven Little's character, Marshall Tucker, was playing very well. Marshall was not holy himself. Here he got paid to do the job and gives these guys time for everything in the van on the way there. Do not bite hands that feed you. It is hard for me to believe that a jazz player who has it claims to know no Dixieland melodies. It makes great sense to anticipate changes in melody chords he doesn't know. Not a common but not unheard of one. At the end of the film, he gives a faithful and cruel message when he tells the clarinetist, "It's not religion, devotion isn't enough." At this level, she is right, though I think the clarinetist could do the job. He practiced his ass and the music of the vocal accompaniment is not that difficult to read. Very nice movie.
