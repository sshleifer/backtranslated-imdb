Bob Cummings is great because this technically brilliant movie Hitchcock really did not gain fame as some of his other films, but is still very attentive today. Priscilla Lane proves she can keep it with other blondes who later worked with Hitchcock. After the film, she made only a few movies that made her almost forgotten today. Here are the sequences that remind the viewer of scenarios in later director's films. Acting is so well done and the story is so good that this movie is still very fun today. Every person in the cast plays well. There are some great backdrops in black and white. It was the first film in Universal for Hitchcock. A long run between feature films made at Universal, plus a television series, Hitchcock would do as much cash for studios as anyone who worked there. This fact is lost in the history of the film. Norman Lloyd is well cast in this movie. The story moves very well, including Hitchcock's single shot sequence. This movie is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved doing it.
