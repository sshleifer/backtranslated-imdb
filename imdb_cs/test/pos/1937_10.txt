This is a forgotten classic of the movie, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton of her for "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is the way, so better. It is no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor to walk around the country. No, in fact he's a terrible actor. But he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted and his role in this film. He is perfect as a kind-hearted but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this film is the best of his career. He is phenomenal as a dazed character wackjob. Then there's Dennis Hopper who's perfect. This movie is just amazing, and if you haven't seen it, go out and watch it today. It's amazing. One of the best portraits of modern America I've seen.
