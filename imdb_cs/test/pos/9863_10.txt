I have to warn you, there are spoilers. But to start it, I mean in February "Spanish Judge". It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I can see, it wasn't ordered back. But either I do. I thought it was good. I wanted to see it mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard. A man who is a good actor. The story of an artist named Jack (Matthew Lillard) who claims to have merchandises called Spanish judges. If you do not know what the Spanish judges have seen or not, and this is the first review you have read, I will not even say what they are. I think it would be a big deal that no one would know what it was. He needs protection, so he hires a couple who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as a cheater named Piece (Mark Boone Junior). She has a girlfriend who doesn't even tell her her name because she's from Mars as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then it turns into one big game. A game that includes some lust, lies and betrayal. There was something over playing in it (Matt and Valeria, like Tamara, wasn't one of them). There were some scenes that could do better and the score could be a little better. Some scores were actually good. The theme they used to start and end (before credits) was a good choice of song, that's my opinion. Eventually, the battle scene could be a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Shit, playing a smooth, slippery man. I know this is a review, but I have to fix it towards NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, he has been working since 1983. For me, and hopefully for others, he is known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both "Hot Shots!" movies. But a good review. Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above), I'll give you a mark of what I am thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
