It's an interesting exercise that witnesses the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without a vision of 20/20 that the look back offers, you can see the pins and wheels that make these people. Then follows a look at Christopher Nolan's past, one of the greatest space-time sprawls that has expanded today. Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style puts great emphasis on providing a story. Although people may complain that they rely too much on the shift of time and time, I still find it fascinating to see how they use this technique differently. Memento was probably the most controversial piece of the story I've ever seen. Discount from hardened cynics who say it's an old piece of meat wrapped in a decorative dress. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can turn into a stunning mind. The Prestige, which was heavily deprived compared to others, still showed creativity in how his three stories were interwoven. Even in a tired business like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his outstanding yarn weaving tricks and breathed new life into the dark knight. Following is an intense story of intrigue and mystery where we see a artsy writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an unconscious accomplice to various petty crimes and finally sees an end that no one could expect. I've never heard of what I was watching before, I had no idea what to expect. At every point, the film guessed where he was leading me. Since the mysterious angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what would happen next. And that is where I think the film will succeed so well. The film has many elements that brought me out of many wild goose chases. All this in the smallest possible or as correct as possible. It does not seem to be the reason why the story is told as it is, but you don't feel interested in it. Lack of prejudice or self-confident arrogance is what makes this style of story work. Highly recommended!
