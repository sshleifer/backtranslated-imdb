I have never read or seen Bard's original work, I cannot begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead, I'll just say that it was a very funny story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in the budget but still decent enough to enjoy it). I thought all the major actors did a great job. The style of the spell looked blacker than white and almost certainly offended anyone who was angry at that kind of thing, but I thought it was good.
