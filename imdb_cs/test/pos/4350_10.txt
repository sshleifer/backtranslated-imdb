Little Dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's film work, which is free of peer. After a recent DVD rewrite, almost a decade after his initial release in 1997, he lost his power and his influence on documentaries is seen just as Herzog's own Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award. From war. Like the first one, he describes in detail, in too short 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Just as it gives a glimpse of the war, which he sees little. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but as Fog of War brought us into the mind of one of the leading governors of the last century, this film allows us to look into the life of a grunt that is captured by the enemy, tortured, and finally wins. Except, in any way, shape, or form, the film is as simplistic or positive as my brief description. Little Dieter does not need to fly on the titular theme, Dieter Dengler and the Nazi German immigrant (we find that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was not the only man to vote for Hitler and suffer brutally for this stand) Germany for the second time World War II and his own imprisonment in the hands of the Vietcong when his Air Force aircraft was shot down over Laos on February 1, 1966. While the title of the film, and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot, disturbed by the impression of Allied fighter planes on him when he demolished his city as a child, one thinks Dengler is the central theme of the film, that's not true. The subject is Dengler's survival, more precisely his human will, all human will. Details about Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and biased to take Herzog. Neither the fact that he won the Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, D.F.C. and Navy Cross. The thing that pushed Dengler to survive so much and remained a relatively optimistic man (even though there are views of the darker sides) is what's in the middle of this movie, and all of Herzog's canons. Dieter Dengler's "distant barbaric dream" from his past is a fully mature Herzog Country, and the use of Madagascar chant, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, including great touches in score, Herzog's show, maybe with Martin Scorsese, the best image manipulator and music in film. He can connect for a long time!
