what a refreshing change from PG movies that teenage girls have to jump in and out of bed, young boys in high school count on how many girls can "connect" with children, drink, do drugs, etc. etc. Carl Hiaasen has written so many books which are pleasant but barely classic literature. but finally he wrote something that high school kids want to read. And this film sends a message to the kids that they may change that they may hear their voices. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if it's predictable, and a little cone. So he was FREE WILLY and see how well he did it. This is a good family movie .......... rare breed.
