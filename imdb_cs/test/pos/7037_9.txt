I remember it in a spirit similar to Young Ones. We headed back out of the pub and watched it, or strapped it, and then spent weeks repeating each other's lines. One of our friends "Zipmole Watkins" was named after a brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a little restyling on Back Street Abortionist's nose. A lot of great lines "Remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. He is an easy guy!" - Gandhi as a local trader. Tony Woodcock was definitely in the episode Ralph (Daniel Peacock) taught him to be a bartender "He's not a good Amanda I never do as a bar man" Helen Lederer teaches him to ask People on the match "Watch the match last night? I thought Woodcock played well" After a series of unsuccessful interviews sat the curly hair of Arsenal star at the bar: "Watch the match last night?" "Yeah. I thought I was played well "<br /> <br /> We're still making strange silly lines -" Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg Reg., Reg. Reg Reg Reg " A lot of very surrealistic silly moments and very surrealistic songs from Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist is a personal favorite with a big ending - "And he will mark your 'Return to Sender' <br /> <br /> Good Old Danny Peacock - You've added a lot of evenings for young drinkers, sir. <br /> <br /> ** Updating - on tape j I found some episodes here - Upload Gandhi Sketch on Youtube **
