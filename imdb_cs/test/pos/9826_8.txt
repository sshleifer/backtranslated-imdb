Why do people have to follow the opinion of the masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by brilliant Sydney Pollack (who also has a small role in the film), is another Harrison Ford car. As such, it is pretty good and fun. Certainly, anyone who goes to see it has it in mind or reads a book that is no better. Even the Kristin Scott Thomas fans, including me, knew it would be a variation to play the love of his oldest uncle again. The film itself is satisfying. What's so bad about this movie that it's much better in other (much more valuable) Harrison Ford cars? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the masses should trust a potential viewer.
