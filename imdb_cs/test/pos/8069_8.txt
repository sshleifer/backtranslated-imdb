La Antena, the brave film of Esteban Sapir, an Argentinean director, succeeds both in reintegrating the silent genre of the film and in the encouraging warning story. Setting is a city in thrall to mindless television, its people deprived of power of speech, except for a lonely and mysterious presence on the screen known simply as a voice. In an effort to consolidate his power to power, the amazingly roguish pair of TV moguls, Mr. TV, and the crazy scientist Dr. Y went to The Voice to escape and turned her unique talent into her own grudge. It's up to the young family and the nameless son of Voice to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster story that is in some cases overwhelming, but never less than engrossing. It is a silent film that carries many of its influences on its sleeve; obvious references to silent movie giants such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be easily visible to anyone familiar with their work. Beyond these honors, however, are more subtle references and symbolism. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his supporter go in typical 1930s gangster cars, based on decades of silent film time and a very diverse industry. La Antena benefits from clich√©s plotting equipment and theatrical over-acting common so many silent movies, though in a very conscious and humorous manner. It is the amazing La Antena visual style that distinguishes it from the films it pays. From the hypnotic TV logo to the horrifying broadcasting station on the hill, this film has a brilliant visual ingenuity that rivals Studio Ghibli's animation? and all using real actors and handmade sets. Although this style is often deliberately coral and theatrical, it is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism in La Antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the TV Empire and the waning power of words. At the same time, many of the strongest paintings are original, including the hypnotic swirling of television sets and the nightmare of a food factory. I hate to end this review on an acidic note, but I think the English edition of La Antena is given subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect, with lots of playing with the words on the screen. However, the English language subtitles accompanying the original dialogue are frustrating incomplete, with occasional omissions and mistakes that let the viewer split things for himself. But La Antena is a remarkable cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humor while telling a powerful warning story.
