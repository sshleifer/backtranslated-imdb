I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Stockings in 1994 at the cinema. I went to look because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw the movie trailer and I thought it was funny. After I saw the movie, I must say it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful Hummie Mann score. The movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood, and Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks themselves are funny. But the best role in the film is played by Roger Rees as an evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the film and also the best dialogue ("The King's illegal forest to wild boar to kill it is and is", which stands for "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the royal forest"). and say a sentence that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in stockings are in my book one of the best Mel Brooks movies to date and I can't say I laughed so much about this movie. It's just a non-stop laugh.
