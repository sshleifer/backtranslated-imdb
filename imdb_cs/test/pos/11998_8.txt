This is undoubtedly one of my favorite Columbo episodes ever. Acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is brilliant and the direction is wonderful. Peter Falk, who is brilliant in every episode of Columbo, performs particularly well in this episode. Also great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. The end is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it. > <br /> This is a Columbo movie that WILL NOT BE.
