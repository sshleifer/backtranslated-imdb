Mr. Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after he went to the hospital because of chest pains (he had heart problems in the past). Media and comics everywhere were losing more than I was, or EVER would have expected it ... but it was the grandfather of the observation comedy. This record was his latest production and includes a large section devoted to the theme of death and life prospects. Filming of the project occurred shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he (delightedly) achieved. I watched Carlin's career since fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his current album. It's a privilege for every Carlin fan to see (if not his own copy) this particular show. He was still fast and timed, even at 70! As he would say, "He's not" smiling from Heaven to you ". If he does anything, he doesn't take harp lessons; maybe looking up !!!
