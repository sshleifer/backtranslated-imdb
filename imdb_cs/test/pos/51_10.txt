That was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance from the amazing A-List cast that moves you from smile to laugh to tears and back. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but care for the characters. Mrs. Merkerson blows you away, just like a young man playing young leadership. <br /> <br /> I also thought the design was the highest. The viewer is actually placed within each era as presented. Music is also a blast. Nice choice to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypical but brings some great songs. This is a great story that will survive many repetitive views. Take your time and watch it!
