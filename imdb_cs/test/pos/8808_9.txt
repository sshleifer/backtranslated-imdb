I remember the time when the only thing that existed was where clubs, pubs and parties were. This movie came out a few years after I started going clubbing. If I had never discovered the ravier side of things, this movie might not make sense to me. That night, when I was watching him for the first time, with some friends, I was completely blown away. I've never seen a film that would hit so close to the reality where I was in my life. Almost everything I could relate to in some way. I never had 1 character that I could fully relate to, but rather a combination of all of them. My friends don't differ and I remember all of us who say where we are or where we are. We were all together that weekend, doing exactly what the crew did. Where we looked down and when the movie "descended" I remember actually coming down a little further. It was actually quite depressing in our room during those "low points". This is so good at human traffic. It really taps the whole situation. his unique film in the way it is not driven, but then its not entirely built driven, though the characters are important. it always seemed to be based on situations. Situation as a group and as individuals. Every character is lost in life for his own reasons. but each of them reacts to loss in the same way. Work every job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape everything. their holiday. But the reality is that you can't really escape. Another situation that everyone has to face. <br /> <br /> Me and my friends don't differ from these guys. We all had our own things. Human traffic has helped us explain what we didn't understand about ours. He does it by not talking to you. It made us feel like we weren't the only ones we were there, and the lessons where many others around the world got. It wasn't until my lifestyle changed from party popper to career driven that I would fully understand this movie. These days I watch HT, every now and then (as I just), and remember old times. No other film can do that. I was a peter popper, I was a jip travolta, I went never to ever land with a chosen family. I would have $ 200 in the back burner and I wax a lot! No worries!
