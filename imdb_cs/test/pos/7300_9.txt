I watched this movie when I never read the book, and I took the characters for my price, but I was introduced to them. I got a completely different look from the movie. Without the burden of concentrating on each character, learning my jokes and weaknesses, I could focus on the cultural issues in the film. . The Iowa farmers' families are so closely intertwined as they are in the Indiana region, where I grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, when I immediately recognized the back stories and motives of the characters. Maybe Jane Smiley meant to us that they had to live outside of the world, but the audience was so impressed by the "Hollywood" aura of the individual actors that they lacked a rich lifestyle that exists less. and less than every decade passes. Another movie with these characteristics is "Madison County Bridges". Try to watch these films carefully on the whole picture.
