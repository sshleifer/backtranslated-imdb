Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes watching people. Bill collects a stranger on the street or the subway, the subway and follows them as if they were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him inspire himself to write a great novel he dreams of, or to print an article that will be printed in the main magazine? Maybe it's because he fills Bill's lonely life with a sense and even makes his curiosity face in the crowd with the meaning and essence of his attention he gives him? Or maybe he gives Bill somebody to look after him and take care of him and be responsible for him? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: after you follow him to your home or place of work, you stop. One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, at home, and instead of following his stop rule, he still holds Cobb. Bill soon realizes how well he has been with this rule he has set in the following people, and at the same time was wrong about breaking it. A surprisingly good low budget movie created by Christopher Noland in 1998 before it hit him in Hollywood with his breakthrough and original "Momento" classic two years later, which has already become a significant cult film. "Watching" is actually a much better movie than "Momento" because it's a conventional and easy-to-follow story. Compared to "Momento", which was initially confusing and then, when you realize what the movie tells you, it's very complicated. What makes "Following" much better is just that it's simple, but it also boasts of influencing those who follow it. The film is much more direct as well as devastating, and you don't have to see it again and again to get exactly what it was trying to say to them as "Momento." "Tracking" is a story within a story with one of the most surprising, as well as simply manipulated ends, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues you will ever see. Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, that's less than what most Hollywood movies divide into coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over an hour, 71 minutes , long. Hollywood and the film industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland about how someone who has nothing more than talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars cannot in most cases; Make an intelligent yet penetrating movie that has nothing in the money and no big stars.
