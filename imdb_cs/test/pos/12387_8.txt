I suppose this film is not your typical Spanish thriller because it is based on a real story that happened abroad. The film is based on the true story of the French man Jean-Claude Romand and the real case is much bigger and more frightening than the film. In the real story of Mr. Romand the family did not escape, after years of lies he decided to put an end to it by killing his wife, two children, his parents and his dog, and even though he tried to kill himself, he didn't. Try to survive very hard. I watched a movie with people who talked to me about how it would never have happened in real life, that all these lies were not revealed, I laughed when I read a book about Mr. Romand and I knew that it happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, offered us a good performance as the rest of the crew.
