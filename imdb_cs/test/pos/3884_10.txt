Jeff Garlin's movie is full of heart and laughter. Like Curb Your Enthusiasm, his personality on screen is cheerful; but moreover, we see both warmth and emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film records dreams of love, success and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. Supporting casts bring frustration and enjoyment to life on the screen in witty and heartbreaking ways. The simple joy of eating, friendship and re-engagement, once life has failed us, are all topics. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this movie. Every Jeff Garlin TV fan has to see!
