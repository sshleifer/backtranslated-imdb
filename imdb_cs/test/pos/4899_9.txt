The film was apparently born out of an idea one of the authors had when he "saw" one of his creations in the supermarket. Royston Vasey's people are heading to 'our' world to persuade writers to keep writing about them, thus destroying their world. <br /> <br /> If it sounds a little serious, don't be discouraged. In the first few minutes, we get: Bernice (a glorious female vicar), who has been torn apart during her confession for unhappy repentance; Chinnery (a veterinarian who unintentionally destroys every animal he touches) tries to collect giraffe semen; Mickey (thick behind the faith) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local businessman) are sweet as always - but still disgusting. Some of the regular characters are missing, but the new Gents idea introduces some 16th century characters - and we also have Gents in action. If you are a newcomer to the Lords League, it's an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you are a longtime fan, it has everything you expect - including the joy of spotting Jeremy Dyson. All that has been said is that it has the same weakly surrealistic humor that is the hallmark of the series, plus some moments of moving "introspection." For example, Mr. Lipp retains a gentle dignity when he learns that his creators consider him a "witty figure". While most characters stay as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are completely natural when they happen. This movie is a "swan song" for Royston Vasey, but it's also a show of Gentlemen who prove it (gasping!), They can write other things - and that can be very funny. (But you still knew.)
