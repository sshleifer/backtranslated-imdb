As I expected, too many reviews of this film (from both professionals and amateurs) focused on film ideology, if not more. That's because the Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a film about euthanasia. Specifically, this is the real story of the infamous Galician name Ramón Sampedra, who has been fighting for many years for the right to assisted suicide, which the Spanish Constitutional Court denied this right, and who - I do not want to destroy the end of the film for you. Real Life Sampedro catalyzed the national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now with the producer / director / writer / songwriter / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997, and The Other, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside, more rhetorical help has been published in the international debate on the issue. But as I keep saying (to the deaf ears), your opinion, for or against, the film's ideology should not affect your film rating. You should not evaluate the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to do. You should rate the movie as a movie. Perhaps it is a little too idealistic, because none of us is likely to divorce our values ​​from our ideological prejudices, but idealistic or not, that is the goal. So forget about philosophical and political questions for a while. As a film, Amenábar has turned to one of his most elegant and mature works to this day. It focuses on social debates. It does not focus on Sampedra's legal / political struggles. He focuses on Sampedro as a man who lives on his bed-limited days in his brother's house. Sampedro, playing here in the amazing performance of Javier Bardem, was quadriplegic. As the film begins, he has been quadriplegic for 26 years. This condition was caused by how Amenábar shows us amazing shots, a diving accident - Sampedro was scattered by a beautiful woman, recalculated water, threw himself in, broke his neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry, some of which were published in the book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters From Hell"); Real Life Sampedro book has become the best seller in Spain. Maybe Amenábar created Sampedro's artistic work as a hint and created an elegantly poetic film. Most of the sea inside is in the Sampedro bedroom. Focusing on these scenes is Bardem's complex and noble performance. As a quadriplegic, Bardem is limited to moving his head and speaking. He mastered the subtle changes in expression and inflection to convey a profound character with a multifaceted, intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar often have a false phrase in the philosophical expression of Sampedro, but there is always a combination of evil sense of humor, a passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and sadness and even occasional bitterness beneath the surface. Different basic emotions occasionally pierce similar waves on the ocean skin. <br /> <br /> People with whom Sampedro communicates most often make it easy to do so in difficult ways. These others include his sister-in-law, Manuel (Mabel Rivera), who was his chief caretaker since the Sampedro accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the vocal opponents to Sampedro's wish to death, and with whom there is a fundamental unsolved problem (it seems that José was the one who saved Sampedro from drowning?); his nephew Javier (Tamar Novas), who is perhaps most understandable to him; advocate of law, Gené (Clara Segur); pro bono lawyer, Julia (Belén Rueda), who he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), and would be more in love with him; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman who works at a canteen and moonlight as a DJ who has heard of him from the media who want to persuade him to desire to live and fall in love with him. > <br /> The bulk of the film consists of these characters who work with their Sampedr in their room. There are also a few other instrumental characters, including Sampedro's father, who remains a strangely distant, and notorious and media-conscious priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who makes his best to change Sampedro's mind through philosophy / theology (in often mistakenly characterized as "comics" - it has an accompanying comic element, but the scene is primarily very serious). That most of the film takes place in the Sampedro room, ingeniously gives the couple a significant change. Sampedro's room has a nice big window that says he is satisfied with the observation point in the world. Perhaps more importantly, he would regularly introduce this window as a launch pad through which he flies over the slopes to the ocean he has always loved and which was the most powerful force in his life. younger and took his mobility away. Amberbar gives us a fantastic Sampedro sequence featuring one of his sea flights. It is beautifully shot, with a low angle (probably from a helicopter) of hills that rushes into a wide open ocean that represents freedom, endless and natural forces in this film. Another significant change of setting comes with Sampedro eventually taking to a wheelchair (he otherwise refused them, stating that they "mocked his immobility") to make an appearance in court to help plead his case. Amenábar gives us an insulting, melancholic travelogue, subjectively photographed from the life of Sampedro, who views life and the world in action from the car window. Whether you agree to legalize euthanasia or not, it's hard to deny that this is a well-played, well-written and well-designed film. You don't have to believe it is ten (and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth seeing as a good example of artistic, sophisticated filmmaking.
