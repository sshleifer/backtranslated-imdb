Of all the episodes of all series, this one is closest to the original principle of Roddenberry. According to THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in the Roddenberry Writer's Guide to his story writers, he states that any foreign creature, no matter how terribly ugly, impossible to believe, harmless or harmful, MUST keep a certain semblance of humanity, which watching television public can empathize with and / or relate to it. Devil in the darkness of HORTA, which is no more than less than a large piece of cow dung, is the mother who protects her children, the ball-shaped silicon nodules that the miners keep in the mine passage and destroy because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my favorite episodes.
