I'm not going to be bored with the story and the plot lines, because they were presented on this page many times, so? It's been the time I've seen such a movie. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a narrative pace. A film with sensitivity and undervalued qualities, which is a rare clich√© at this time. A beautifully subdued photograph, saturated with rich luxury colors and lack of better words, each frame is filled with air of tension. The settings and locations are used repeatedly, but the film can breathe new life every time it appears, it always seems to be a key support, luminaire or set of pieces that will attract the audience where we are in the characters. world. Acting reminds me of a "bike thief", not a style, but the fact that you forget to watch two actors dealing with their craft. Behind each gesture is meaningful and almost every movement has the meaning to explain the inner world of the characters, relationship, feelings and situation of both lovers. The dialogue is sparse, but like the rest of the film, it is filled with meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here is telling the device. And even though the film is of Chinese origin, the song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole adds a subtle meaning to the film. The controlled soundtrack is repeated, but repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used in conjunction with the story, and not just the means of music music to action, or to cue viewers to feel in a certain way at a certain point plot. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, I'm afraid most people would be tired of the quiet stream of the story, but I would recommend it to someone looking for an alternative to a romantic schlock that fills our multiplexes the world. I have to say that I was absolutely interested in this film and continued to watch him the night after night. The story takes a long time to introduce itself and carry repeated views, because very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. Very beautiful movie.
