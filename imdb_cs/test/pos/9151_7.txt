Most of the silent movies I saw were serious nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The setting and some scenes for "Beloved Rogue" reminded the 1923 "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" due to Parisian street scenes and the celebration of the "King of Fools". John Barrymore portrays the greatest French poet Francois Villon in a characterization that moves quite widely from virtual grotesque to romantic offerings; that "water for wine" is a little fun at the beginning. It seems that times will never change and it is interesting to watch a movie that is almost a century ago a convincing observation - in Paris it is a fool to rule one night, while everywhere else it still has one. How true it is. The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a bit surprising for the viewer, I saw him as Major Strasser in "Casablanca", one of his most recent films. As King Louis XI. He is a monarch obsessed with astrology, a crafty but suspicious, and it was a little uncomfortable to see him closely resembling Brad Dourif Wormtounge from the last chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Not exactly radiate the confidence a French king could expect. That is why it seemed that the dominance of the Duke of Burgundy (Lawson Butt) was all the more credible when Villon rose to this opportunity to confront both rulers. It was interesting to note that the use of the intertitle card was extremely reserve, only used when it was absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, however, someone would miss a curious zero. It seems that Villon made his exile from Paris in the Lame Flea hostel! <br /> <br /> The printing I saw was of exceptional quality, the first film to be presented in one hundred hundred films from Action and Suspension by Mill Creek Entertainment, which says something for a film that is now eighty years old. It's great that silent-era movies now find a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them available to a whole new generation of movie lovers. One question - it seemed like Conrad Veidt's King Louis was deliberately picking up his nose, or as an unintentional gesture that remained safe from the room?
