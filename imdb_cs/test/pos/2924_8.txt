Few people realize this, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks came to the scene. In addition to the literary remains that are in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there have been considerable works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The top of the former was religious poetry and "Epic of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians produced many poems, but the main addition was the story of a traveler adventure and a physician called the "Sinuhe Story". From this work (actually a fragment that we do not know the end) comes the novel "Egyptian". The story is unique (just like the movie). "Egyptian" was the best seller in the early fifties and Darryl Zanuck decided to do it: yes, he wanted for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as a show, as did the rest of the cast (Victor Mature, Edmund). Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he knew these movies rarely made a big box office. One of them can learn as an example of Zanuck trying something else. The number of movies that deal with ancient Egypt is very small. "Earth Pharoahs", "Egyptian", "Ten Commandments" (both De Mille Version), "Moses", "Holy Moses!", "Cleopatra", "Mummy" (All Versions), "Scorpion King". there are 20 movies about ancient Egypt, it's great, but "Egyptian" is unique, while the second "Ten Commandments" deals with Ramses the Great (Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke) and films about Cleopatra The biggest Egyptian Pharoah was Thutmose III, who conquered most of the well-known Middle East era of the 1470 BCE or so, and there was no film, nor its predecessor, which is the first in history. The only known Pharoah who attempted a religious revolution that came close to what Jews (and later Christians) - a type of monotheism - attempted - is the subject of "Egyptian." Actually, Akhnaton practiced a personal form of monotheism that was not meant for public consumption. But she annoyed the priestly class that worshiped Amon rather than Atona. Due to our uncertain historical records (even though Akhnaton's official records - "Tel-el-Aman" letters - are completely complete if they survive), we don't know if the Pharoah was killed in the palace coup or not. However, he died, he was succeeded by a young brother or his son whose name is better to remember than any other Pharoah except Ramses: Tutankhamon. This movie is actually pretty good as far as it goes. Wilding is a good Akhnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer. Mature is good as an ambitious (and beyond the future successful future Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom are leading in their lead, and Ustinov is a good friend of Purdom. Also good is Mrs. Darvi, in the big support section. In a beautiful portrait, John Carridine is a thief of a philosophical grave. The film is certainly worthy of observation, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
