The film appeared in 1989 when Charlie was awarded for his role in the defeat of communism. I must admit that my heart sank when he thought he had to endure another serious, somewhat boring and too long life story. How bad I was, because the short scene is as close as the movie gets to the boring one. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of fun and fun scenes and cracked dialogues at some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie on Hot-Tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a television program. Another fairly entertaining scene is about three quarters of the movie that includes Charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a whiskey bottle. As for the dialogue on what this line means: "The Senator says he can teach us to write, but we can't teach us to grow breasts." OK, School-boyish I know, but the movie is stuck with great lines. As far as performance is concerned, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, steals every scene he is in. Hanks is fine, but surprisingly me as Julia Roberts who is very good at the role of a somewhat eccentric Texas oil millionaire. Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non-musician Bio-Photos in the long run, just as it's a rare thing the movie he enjoys, enjoys and informs everyone on the same scale.
