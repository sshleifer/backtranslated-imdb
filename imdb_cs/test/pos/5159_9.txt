This movie shouldn't be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Not designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy over a series of vignettes. It's not written as an action adventure, but my pulse ran more than once. Like life, this movie doesn't affect your emotions and tells you how to feel. It's just, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you don't find it fun or sad or moving, I suspect he says more about you than film. It's amazing and refreshing to see the director so unconditionally celebrate that we're all humans, and accept that we're all trapped here, doing this "life" thing over and over as long as we have to. Tomorrow is the next day.
