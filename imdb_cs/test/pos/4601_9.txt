This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I was expecting it for a long time and I was afraid that I would not be able to meet my expectations. <br /> <br /> Crossed them. I loved this movie. Fortunately, from start to finish (staying up to the end of the credits!), it's remarkable how a film about stupid and annoying characters can be so intelligent, witty and engaging. It's obvious matte images, the film's future Earth resembles Planet Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies of that time. In fact, this film is basically a Planet of the Apes, but with people who are the mental equivalent of great apes. It moves at a relatively fast pace, and Luke Wilson carries the film pretty well, with a character that resembles the one who played in "Bottle Rocket". . "(Even in the morning scene, there is even a not-so-subtle nod to" Bottle Rocket "). Despite all the strengths, the "Idiocracy" has a distinctive feel for a movie that has been taken away from the director / editor before it can be fine-tuned. several theaters without advanced projections, no trailers, no marketing at all. It is as if the studio decided not to spend any more on it and just left. <br /> <br /> Or maybe they thought the movie was a prerequisite for a cult classic, and the only way to become a true cult classic was to make it unsuccessful? because Mike Judge and this movie deserve especially better performance. <br /> <b r /> I assume this movie will have real feet on the DVD and the word mouth will drive it to the success it deserves. Maybe Fox Executives were in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
