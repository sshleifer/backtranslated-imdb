Anthony Minghella's "English Patient" is a movie that brings us back to Hollywood's golden years. It is a spectacular and impressive measure, yet it is so heartbreaking in its depiction of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most crucial cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, An English patient is a moving meditation on life, love and loss that follows the history of a critically burned man as a result of World War II. During the war, man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remains of a crashed plane. With a scarred face unseen and a man who apparently suffers from amnesia, he is presumed to be an allied soldier and is simply referred to as an "English patient." After the war, in the mine hills, which concerned min, the kind nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently lost everyone close to her, remains in the ruins of the monastery to take care of the dying man. Over time, he learns more and more about his "English patient", which is actually revealed as a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing memory in a plane crash, we find that this scarred man may have decided to forget his past, how to protect himself from persecution, and to cure his tragic memories of his past love. Despite numerous flashbacks, we learn about the former abuses of Almas in the Sahara Desert and his romantic relationships with married wife Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). It's definitely easy to understand why an English patient at the Oscars was so successful. It is such a beautiful film that combines the tranquil beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not because David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence Arabia' has the film shown a desert with such beauty and grandeur, making especially good use of extensive aerial shots from the Almásy aircraft. Even in the more intimate moments of the film, he captures the excellent use of detail and illumination to capture the emotions of the scene, coupled with the brilliant performance of all cast members. Long-time my favorite actor, 'English Patient' could only contain the best performance of Ralph Fiennes, and due to its history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'Constant Gardener,' this is not a supplement that should be taken lightly. His Earl Laszlo de Almásy is at first a very sympathetic character, but when we slowly learn about his past, his sympathetic qualities are disturbed by his less admirable tendencies to others. "Ownership" is the main theme of the film. When they asked Katherine what she hated the most, Almasy would say, "Ownership. Own. However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine may be trying to distance herself from it, Almasy reveals a hint of arrogance and insists that his love for her in some way entitles him to have her whenever he likes: "I want you touch. the things that are mine that belong to me. Juliette Binoche, who won the Oscar, is excellent because Hana, a lonely sister who is afraid of love, because of the tragedies that have always hurt the loved ones. After some time of care for Almásy alone, she is joined by the dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost thumbs during the war, and who suspects it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also made a makeshift romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomber in the British Army. However, because of her past history, she is afraid of engaging with Kip in death, especially in view of his very dangerous work. After 160 minutes of "The English Patient", it beautifully recalls the memories of the classic romantic old epics that have successfully found the balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is heartbreaking and sad, but also uplifting in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the outset, others have a very good chance to bring happiness. However, in any case, it is always better to love and lose than never to love.
