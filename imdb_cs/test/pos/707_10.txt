I read on the web that this movie is redesigned into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's time for Hollywood to act together. The large studios always frowned at the irritated material Oscar had written everywhere. Go Image !! <br /> <br /> JERIC's MILE was ahead of us. It's a masterpiece. Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to engage viewers without excessive agreement. Peter Strauss' Emmy's performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie-viewing life. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless the academic award is already on their cloak). A delicate multiracial set, a background for JERIC MILE, allows you to understand the subtle social situation. the dynamics of our world. It is a redemption without public confirmation and the power of the human spirit to overcome all obstacles. Imagine a convict because he was a teenager for a lifetime without the chance of being released, which he does not know is perhaps the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do ?? <br /> <br /> This film will leave you feeling that you have not been deceived at any level. Completely exciting, engaging, emotional and soundtrack "Rolling Stones" that kicks ass !!! I've always thought it would be a big screen ... I can't wait ...! !! Meanwhile, I'll have to watch my weathered copy of VHS again, which I've had for many years.
