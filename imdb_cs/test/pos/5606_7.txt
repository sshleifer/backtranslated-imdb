Although it is not the best work of Hal Hartley (my personal favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there is still a lot to like about this movie, especially for Hartley's dialogue fans. Even for viewers of the new Hartley, I would definitely recommend this movie through sophomoric "Dogma." This film is more intelligent, truer to its source material (Bible), and more fun than any of the other films before the millennium of apocalypse. This film is actually part of the French film "2000 As Seen By." (2000 Par Vu) series, as such it is perhaps even a lower budget than Hartley's other works. the need for simple scenes taken with a digital camera, the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of a blurry / nervous effect, I'd like to never see this effect again in the movie, especially an almost imperceptible movie. Especially noteworthy is Magdalena (played by PJ Harvey) about how Jesus saved her from stoning to death, surprisingly moving the short scene (despite the fact that it didn't happen to Mary Magdalene that it happened to a woman in the Bible) <br /> <br />
