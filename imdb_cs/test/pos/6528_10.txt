I love Aaron Carter, but I also expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so bad! Aaron Carter was a really funny and great actor! Also, the actress who played Jane was a great actress! Anyone who hasn't seen it loved it! The music in it was also really good! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines from the movie are: public school mom! and "Take your time, you'll come to you!" <br /> <br /> Although ending with a kind of cheese, all the good chicks swipe to do! This movie is great, and a good good Chick movie that I can watch again and again!
