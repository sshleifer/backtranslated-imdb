This film is a fairly fair adaptation of the novel Prosper Merimeé. In the novel Merimeé itself is a character, Don José is from Navarra (northern Spain, and historically Basque Country Zone, they can speak the Basque language). They are in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and they only speak Spanish with an Andalusian accent, by no means they speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she lived in Navarre. You can believe it or not, yet it's a book version, then you can't be critical with the film about being booked! You have to notice that the novel Merimeé and the opera Bizet are different, and this film is an adaptation of the novel, yet in the opera Don José is still Spanish from Navarre, never a Frenchman. Why do so many people think Don José is a Frenchman? I don't know, but I think the novel and opera are in French, even if they're supposed to be in Spanish. The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in Don José he also kills the "torero" lover of Carmen and the novel he does not have (even in opera). I think they wanted the movie to be a little more gore! I think the movie is pretty good.
