I think this TV movie was first aired in the same week as Manchester Utd played in the Champions League final (1999), running a lot of football-related items this week, which was absolutely unique. He played on all the clich√©s that are thrown out every season during the FA Cup, ie, on barren smogs, happy clothes / mascots, cup names, and so on, and it turned out to be brilliantly fun. I'm Surprised He has never been repeated before other great football opportunities, even now that the World Cup has just started. Several previous posts from fans that are not soccer fans have said they still love them, but a football fan will keep it cool.
