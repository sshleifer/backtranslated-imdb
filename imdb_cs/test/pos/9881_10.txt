The Best Comedy Comedy Comedy, Oz Scott. The list of TV icons of the 1980s continues. Milano (who's the boss), Yothers (family ties), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (night trial), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). It's one of the funniest movies ever. Great lines, senseless undercuts, cheesy, bad stuff. It is a group of high school children who need to go through drivers. The Night Court Mac needs to take a final exam or be fired. The great performance of Brian Bloom as a jerk / little cool guy Riko Conner, but nothing against B.D. Wong is Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). Great movie for all ages, so bad it's good.
