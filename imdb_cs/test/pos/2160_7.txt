The night hunter starts in 1968 as a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) is unexpectedly handed over a family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim), a fellow vampire hunter, betrays his family and passes them to Vampire. To help Jack in his quest, he is given a book that contains the name of every live vampire, or dead, depending on how you look at it ... Jump on 'June 1995' & Los Angeles, where now the adult Cutter (Don 'Dragon) 'Wilson, also credited as co-producer) has but four names left in the book including, Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford) together they are the last American Vampires. As everyone eats in a restaurant Cutter crashes a party and kills them, the job done right? Bad as King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world, French Tournier (Maria Ford), Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to watch Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, the detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea that a curious reporter named Raima Baker (Melanie Smith) is involved in the struggle between Cutter and the vampire on which the Earth's destiny is based. Br /> <br /> Director Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to go through 85 odd minutes. The screenplay by William C. Martell blends martial arts and horror with a fair degree of success, moves at a comfortable pace, and is at least never boring and, fortunately, does not seem to take himself too seriously. The names of the characters referred to by other horror film directors / actors are a bit cheap. Some may be surprised at how close the Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998), although it was made a few years ago, a lonely, moody long coat worn by a vampire hunter who becomes a martial arts expert, a nightclub scene and an innocent woman into the world vampires. Night hunter does not adhere to the traditional law of vampire films, for example, sunlight irritates their eyes, they can only reproduce the solar eclipse (why?), Betting over hearts and garlic are not good as a way to kill a vampire at Night Hunter's neck break. I could have done it with a bit of horror and a bit more blood, as it leans more towards the martial arts side. The dialogue is suitably kitschy and the character is just so sympathetic in a stupid way. Director Jacobson is trying to destroy the movie, the action scenes are fine, but they miss something that is bizarre for them whenever an action sequence takes place, shaking the camera constantly, it's like a camera placed on the entire cycle of the washing machine! Hey, Rick, buddy, it's not smart or stylish, it's irritating and unpleasant. Gore is disappointed with several cruel gunshot wounds and a few splashes of blood; <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably wasn't as much a Night Hunter, it's in its entirety. Acting was bad for most of the time and what's going on with "The Dragon" in Don 'The Dragon' Wilson? Has he changed his name legally? Signs Don 'The Dragon' Wilson checks! Will he get mail to him in that name? I think I could do something like that, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... Night Hunter is one of those movies that transcend his limitations and horror to become pure golden fun. If you like your movies fun then a night hunter might be for you if your looking for a great budget excitement in similar veins (! Vampire, veins and blood get it?) Then Blade and it's sequel would probably be a better option. What the hell I like to sue this way.
