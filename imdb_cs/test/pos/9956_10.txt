not having ever seen anything about this luvvies beloved, let alone the merchant's production in Venice, I can't comment on how faithful the previous game adaptation is, so I'll treat him like another film trying to be more than novocaine for the eye MoV is instantly grabbing a film about a young bassanio lover (fiennes) and his business friend antonio (irons) and jewish money lender shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> a plot summary <br /> <br /> bassiano is broken and he needs money to marry a beautiful port (collins), he goes to his friend antonio who sympathizes with his friendship, so he borrows some money from shylock <br /> <br /> now antonio doesn't have Jews in general and especially shylock and shylock bitter and twisted from abuses that suffered mainly from antonio, and Christians generally agree to lend antonio money on condition that if antonio does not pay the loan in to A timely term, shylock will cut antonios pound flesh body <br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> the movie is amazingly beautiful and acted and spoken so that it forces you to think about what each line means, which in turn causes the viewer to gain insight into the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> it seems to me that I am a film about the possibilities shylock does, and how bad choices lead to the destruction of shylogs <br /> <br /> From the moment Shylock requires his pound body to be condemned, for the rest of the world he opposes him and Connives bring his fall <br /> <br /> it very upset me, usually in the movie, when the victim gets a chance of revenge against those who have hurt him Either the victim succeeds or causes the villain to see the error of his paths leading to a great embrace, not in the MoV victim, he quickly understands himself as a villain and is deprived of his happiness and belief <br /> <br /> this the film is a powerful and subtle portrait of informal anti-Semitism that shows how it can that the whole company turn on the minority and make it look like the victim is really the offender <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie 10/10
