The story is pretty common; the average family wants outside the rat race; wants to find a simple life .... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children in tow. The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house .... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are murdered and no one knows how (don't mind why). Gerald McRaney is an excellent, familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; because this movie was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel! While the story is a bit above the top; if you are a movie enthusiast, you will be alerted to similar scenarios from "" Psycho ""; ""Deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of this genre. Several images and camera sequences will give you a sense of d√©va vu. Sit down and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously, it's very fun; and better than, for example, the more recent movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; they seem to have made better films in the good 80's!
