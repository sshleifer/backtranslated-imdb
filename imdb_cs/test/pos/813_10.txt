This must be one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaves everything that lives in the wild. When Mom and Dad lose their jobs, not to mention they have green slime in the tub. They decide that their families have the best interest in moving to Oregon. As soon as everything goes wrong. Interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. Including young Molly Ringwald, this movie I would definitely recommend.
