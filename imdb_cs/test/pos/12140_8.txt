This is a black and white movie from France, <br /> <br /> A simple plot, a gangster running and looking for help, etc. We've seen this type of film many times over the years. What makes this film different is mainly its acting style and style. All actors stand out quietly, no one screams and hardly anyone loses their mood. There is quite a few deaths, some surprises. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No car chases nor. <br /> <br /> JUST Talk / It's so refreshing to listen to people talking, and here we have to read headlines as well. The actor is close to perfect by everyone. Especially the lead played by Lino Ventura & in a minor BUT the vital role of Jean Paul Belmondo. These two actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said the movie is wrong, There are a few shortcomings of scripts in several places, They're smaller, Acting is a thing in this movie. Production is also the first. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (of 4) 88 points (of 100) IMDb 8 (of 10)
