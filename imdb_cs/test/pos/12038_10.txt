It's a hard movie coming in the US, but if you find it - and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, you're good. It's quite historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks amazing like Grainger at this time. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is a little better than the real Karen, but that was the inaccuracy I liked to discover (!). I think what really struck me was how well Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality. Rose was also Barbara Hershey's rose. If he looks considerably younger than Rose at the time, she's more than just how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It's an easy movie to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion", my wife had no special affinity with Grainger and his music, nor did she know about it, but the movie was completely enchanted.
