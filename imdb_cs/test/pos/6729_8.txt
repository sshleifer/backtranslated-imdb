I remember watching it as a child in the Film Foundation for Kids on Friday, the Film Specials at CBBC and recently happened on a copy. Twenty years after my last viewing, the film has lost nothing. It's an atmospheric story that attracts Cornish folklore and adds elements of a truly spooky image to the spirit of young miner Billy. Shot in a beautifully picturesque setting, the Port Loe area of ​​Cornwall film uses a mixture of rough coastline and abandoned tin mines to make settings truly credible. There's a lot of wrapped up in this CFF drama, something long since lost from TV today and it's worth a look if you can watch a copy.
