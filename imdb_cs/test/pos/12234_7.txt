Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. It would be nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly, like Herbert, has had a good resemblance to him in recent years. Jones and Martin sing beautifully. Herbert's music is just there to embellish the plot line of these two musicians. Jones' John Ramsay is a fragile figure, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat who played Jones as well. As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career. She has filmed with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell. She performed well, but the film audience couldn't. The best musical moment in the film is Jones and Martin in the duo Thine Alone. The recordings I have about the song are individual and have been written as a duet. There's also a nice scene with Jones and Martin on the bikes that exchange Herbert's songs as they ride. Real Victor Herbert with his ginseng and his Irish patriotic background and his musical training in Germany, where he developed the love of all German things, would be a fascinating study. He was also a virtuoso cello before turning full-time on composing. I have to take a strong exception to a reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would be a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. Nice movie, but the real Vic would be much better.
