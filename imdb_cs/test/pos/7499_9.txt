The best screen performance ever written by George C. Scott. Chayefsky's script, an ironic costly dialogue, is almost perfect ("Where are you training your sisters, Dachau?"). Rigg is amazing as a rescue angel who saves Scott from destruction, as well as the entire cast. It's a jolly and serious movie. It is a film from the sixties, but it is in no way dated. What it is about, chaos and system irrationality vs. the individual's common sense is timeless. And "We are treating nothing. We will not cure anything" a monologue (delivered, shouted, like none other than Scott) with its references to cloning and other "wonders" of modern science could be literally written this morning. > <br />
