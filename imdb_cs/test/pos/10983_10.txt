If Hollywood enjoyed the audience, we would see 20 films a year with such a healthy courage behind the film. In this film, there are some experiences of personal growth, and although the characters are still very human, or the lessons that greed does not give you, or that you do it to others-what-you-want-as-long-as-you-you- you-you -Is-okay-with-it, no, that's what our sad, numb lives need, more meaning ... more love ... more do-to-others-like-you-by- to have ... more HOPE. (Thanks Ursula!) This movie has an intelligent joke, not "yo" moms cracks that run uncontrollably in so-called comedies. People have to feel good. This film will make you feel good and maybe inspire you to better the lives and lives of others. SIDEOOTHE Everybody counts on selling tickets, it's a truly independent movie, and you need to support them if you want quality movies.
