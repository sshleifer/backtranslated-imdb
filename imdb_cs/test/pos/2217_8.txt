"Half Empty" is a merry musical about the eternal optimist in this case, a self-help writer who mistakenly thinks he is popular there. Instead of a pious audience, he finds himself in a world of tired misanthropes, including a woman to be his publicist. His attempts to establish friendships in scenes that are largely improvised lead to one big encounter at a time when he is misused by nihilistic musicians, grumpy gangsters, etc. Over time he manages to win over his publicist? Heart and Her Mind - But his own world view is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, shows that it is not exactly what it seems. The action is interrupted by several music numbers. We saw this at the DeadCenter Film Festival in Oklahoma City and were blown away. This is really funny, inspired by tiny indie productions. You could argue about a few technical things (such as lighting that is a bit dark), but the work is funny and inspired enough that you can't care too much. If Voltaire wrote "Candide" today, the character would be the author of self-help.
