Christopher Boyce, who was in Los Angeles in the 1970s, just left the seminary school and returned home, where his father got him a job to watch news documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a rough cock drug-dealer, and gets caught in the setting, and has to choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in jail. When she is bailed, she jumps and heads for Mexico City. Chris offered Lee a partnership to be his messenger to sell the secret documents of the Soviet Union Embassy in Mexico City because of the shame he felt the US government was controlling the weaker country to make its profit. Over time, however, they start to confront their motivation and find themselves in something more than they originally intended. Director John Schlesinger has released such films as "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man" "," Sunday Bloody Sunday "and" Locust Day ". While "Falcon and Snowman" may not be so high, there is no doubt that this dark spy drama (inspired by a real incident) is an unfairly overlooked portrait character. All that is about is quite a subdued matter without real majestic qualities that would hit a massive brand. The film's driving force must be the remarkably versatile performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious young boys Chris and Daulton. Penn is especially good with his unpleasant intensity, which works well outside Hutton's super cool and collected turn. What starts so easily is how the situation gradually disintegrates as both amateurs find themselves really out of their league. Strongly detailed and symbolic (predatory behavior) conspiracy focuses mainly on the relationship of the couple and their reasoning for their actions, which ultimately shows us how things that led to their fall evolved. The plan opens like a blow that never heals properly, because of Daulton's drug addiction, which really makes him go out of the rails and lets Chris pick up all the freedom. There is a political aspect, but it focuses on the topics of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get across. Both do not mix and the results show. Tension is justified by its stimulating pot-boiling scenario and character interactions, ie by the interaction of any visual tricks. The action is very small, but there is still pressure from the style of Schlesinger's secure and realistic dark "n" bold direction. The stimulation is usually well-treated, although some sequences seem to sink for too long, but they will grab you as they play on an authentic paranoid tone that slowly builds up to an exploding, tight end. Adeptically incorporated into technical production is the airy rough music score and professionally annoying cinema. Supporting casts are exceptionally fine with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. See also Michael Ironside in a small part as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> A largely superb spy movie that benefits mainly from talented performances and not playing the usual bets. It is rather an emotional ride, then a complicated twist. Recommended.
