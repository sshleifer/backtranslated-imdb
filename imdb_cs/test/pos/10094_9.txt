For most of us, life is a developing process of love. But for others like Soo-mi, he is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant Gothic horror story The Story of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong), and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong) who are part of a dysfunctional family that lives together in a spooky Victorian style. They feel alienated from the world and hold each other for survival, while the older Soo-mi obsessively protects the younger Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coping with the circumstances of her mother's death means mental illness and mind conflict with reality. While we can recognize clamps such as haunted houses with observation garments, the Doors that open and close themselves, the cruel and overwhelming stepmother and other high strange events, The Story of Two Sisters, explores the deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to let go of inner demons and the lost desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what's really scary? Do you want to forget something? Wipe them completely out of your mind. But you can never. You can't leave, you see. Ghost." There is a timeline, but it is left to the viewer to divide. The plot cannot be summed up, it is only suggested, and the film is always interested in whether what is happening on the screen is objective or subjective. asked the doctor in an environment that looks like a mental device. When her doctor asks her to describe what happened "that day," the film flashes back when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to their father's house, Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum). Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and angry and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi that really hurts. When girls try to adapt, they are constantly frightened by the presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences. Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of a bed that floats above her and emits black blood, a dinner scene where a guest seems to see a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into cramps, a monster emerges between one's feet From nurses, people mysteriously disappear from photos, and many other manic schizophrenic devices keep the viewer on the fringe of madness. While we feel that much of the story is a projection of one's mind, we do not know whose and our film is continually challenging us, at least until an important track is offered in the second half of the film. The story of two sisters, shot in beautiful low-light cinematography, has a unique elegance and other secular beauty that overcomes all fears and there is plenty. It is scary in more than one sense of the word and its images can look at you when you least expect it or want it. Although the film doesn't offer a lot of light to a tired traveler, it shows us where we can end if we choose darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Blame is never an answer - whether it blames itself or others. Rather, the answer is to be totally excluded from judgment - both of yourself and others. Forgiveness and understanding have a great deal of healing." "
