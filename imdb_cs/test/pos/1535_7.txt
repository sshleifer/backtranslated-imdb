This two-digit drama is very well-behaved and has a valid message and some TRULY shocking moments (not shocking because they are graphic but because you're not ready for them when they come). But in the end it becomes scary, as is a somewhat similar "pure formality". However, Alan Rickman should be nominated for an Oscar for his multi-dimensional performance, which is no doubt about it. (** 1/2)
