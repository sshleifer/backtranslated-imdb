The war at home is so good that it has become my new favorite show. every little problem. When somebody does something stupid, he never lives, and that is soooo how the family is. Father always harps on all three children about every little thing. I love how parents have no idea how to deal with children. It's so true for real family life and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve the problems of their teenagers just puts the show on top. War at home is so brutally honest, and so true to the world Live in being a milestone for sitcoms to come.
