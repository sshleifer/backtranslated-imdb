I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun, thoughtful movie. Absence of sex, vulgarity and violence that has been made for the most enjoyable evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but that's probably because I live there for a short distance. However, this film could be produced in any city; it is a topic that is so important. I'm just grateful that Manna has fallen down on us from Heaven. Try it ... you'll love it!
