This movie is just one of the best movies I have on my own. It took me years to come up with this movie and it was worth it. The film is supposed to be anti-drug propaganda, but it turns into the opposite, even if it is not even in the middle of the film. The enjoyable view of the players' faces who receive their drug rewards is enjoyable for all who watch. Until the last phase of their drugs, heroin finds out. YIKES! This is a message that was so wonderfully sought. Soundtrack to this movie kicks ass! It's one of the best Pink Floyds albums! If it's a chance, look, listen, and the moment you witness a spectacular movie.
