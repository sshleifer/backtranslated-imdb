I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved every minute that cast and soundtrack anyway. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll that her gaze barely saw naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and oh cursed. Whenever this movie was shown on television and finally cable, I would call my friends to watch it. Just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is amazing thanks to Gladys Knight and The Pips. We have seen a black woman trying to raise her children, deal with teenage pregnancy and everyday life, meet a man who later learns, has problems alone. In the end, this movie got on DVD and deserved.
