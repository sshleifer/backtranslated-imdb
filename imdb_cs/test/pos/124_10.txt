It was a great movie in every sense of the word. It deals with the topic of tribadism in a society that is totally intolerant of deviations from the norm. He criticizes many Indian customs that many consider themselves oppressive - for example, marriage by others, the importance of position and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the appreciation of women for their ability to create children, binding concepts. and so on. The heart of the film is a moving love story that goes beyond the limits of society that both protagonists find themselves. The film is well-functioning and real, totally credible from start to finish, unlike most Bollywood movies. The main mistakes of the film, as I saw, were the first that both lovers seem to be attracted to each other, not necessarily by natural affinity to each other, as well as the fact that they are trapped in closed marriages without passion and not. rewards. This may play a role in the sexual awakening of characters, but most people stranded in the same situation will not be "gay again". From the beginning of the film, it seems clear that both characters are quite heterosexuals - when Radha makes her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it clear that "without desire, she was dead" and the consequence was that if he wished, he could totally to fulfill, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to dislike her. Such situations will not change people into homosexuals - they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but in the film it is not at all clear that they are lesbians from the beginning - quite the contrary. Some people are bisexual, it's true, but most of them are either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of women in the film, they both had a insensitive jerk for the husbands. . . if that were not the case, they would naturally find the need to express their desire in a relationship they would not otherwise consider? The film ignores it. The second mistake is to name the characters. . . the names of Sita and Radha seem to devise intentionally to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another named "Paul"!) by using the names associated with various Hindi letters. The film is strong enough to stand alone, and in my opinion it does not need any such devices. In any case, the mistakes don't take too far from the film's strength. It is really a very moving and powerful story - the pictures and characters will stay with you after long leaving the theater.
