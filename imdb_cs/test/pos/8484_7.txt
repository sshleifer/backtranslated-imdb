Ray is interesting in parts and technically very well done, but Ray is often slow and forgets some important details about Ray's life. The whole film shows us that it is the part where it is in its premiere, and the most successful, which is good, I just wanted to see some pieces about his older life. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles, sometimes it's totally unusual. I have to say that Jamie is why I got through this movie. The first half is much better than the other. It's more interesting, it has more Oomphs and it's not nearly as slow as the other. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to start honestly, so I really didn't have any expectations for the movie what it was. Ray's biggest problem had to be over length. This could be very easy to cut, with more relevant scenes other than the ones they used. I found an early part of Ray's life when he was just beginning to be successful, most interesting. He was then humble and somewhat gentleman. And while the film can exaggerate his actions, I got too much to take care of me. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for ages like Ray. He looks like Ray, talking like Ray, acting like Ray. He even sings like Ray! That's much more than an impression, I really believed he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film and, without his presence, this film would be a complete and complete climax. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line. Ray is interesting at times, very boring for others. When everything was said and done, I was disappointed, as it sometimes seemed normal. Just because it's a bibliographic movie doesn't mean it's Oscar-worthy. Jamie Fox deserves his Oscar, but the movie is above average. It's worth watching, but if I were you, I'd keep my expectations on a fairly comfortable level. <br/> 7/10
