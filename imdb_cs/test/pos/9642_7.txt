I recommend that movie viewers, if in the New York area go to the Intrepid Museum and get some idea of ​​how closed and cramped housing was for the crews of World War II submarines. The more it had to be for the sailors during World War I. It must be really hell below. Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery are the leading actors from Hell under Huston as books. Captain and Montgomery as his free bike number two. They are both quite trustworthy as Navy officers and the rest of the cast, such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc., perform their roles pretty well. Quiet service more popular during World War II and after. It's amazing, but I could name a number of submarine shots, such as Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats of the Navy, Run Silent, Run Deep and many more, and you'll see the same in all of them. I think it's definitely a limit even for situations. Jimmy Durant's performance is interesting. It's pretty funny and its scene with a boxing kangaroo on the shore is really very fun. But I would have to say that a character like him in those cramped spaces is probably necessary for morality. If you do not have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine, you should transfer it to your ship immediately. But the highlight for me is the scene of Sterling Holloway's death. Very similar to Sean McClory on the island in the sky. This will haunt you long after you've seen this movie.
