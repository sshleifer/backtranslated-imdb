"Hell to Pay" bills itself as a rebirth of Classic Western ... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the whole family could see and not unlike baby boomer films experienced decades ago. Good guys are good and bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are great and fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this, maybe even better than his days as "Virginian". In a way, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of those films in the 1960s, when actors you know from so many shows appear. If you are at a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a "wow" factor because we rarely see these icons these days. "Hell Pay" feature of the legend screen along with newer names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of "Newbies" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), who I have seen recently in "Young and Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays angst-ridden Kirby, a war-tired man who is torn between live and let live or enter to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is brilliant as Chance, Kirby's mischievous and effeminate brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebecca's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but unforgettable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a rather ugly average. I think we'll see more of these great actors in the future. "Hell to Pay" is a fun movie with a big story that says? catch popcorn, we are at the forefront of the West!.
