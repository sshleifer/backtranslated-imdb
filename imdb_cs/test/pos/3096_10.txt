Successful metaphysical films are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can enroll a great subject for the youth ambitions, but Herzog does a great job. The aim of the film is to show human beings and even the world from a non-human point of view. The film is in three parts: Creation, Paradise and the Golden Age. The image of each of them is in contrast to the voice. Although the text "Creation" (from Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene no longer means anything but illustrating the myth. He dwells on waste and on various specimens of destruction (fire, smoke, scrapped vehicles). Images of "Paradise" are anything but "Golden Age" is darkly comical? The highest culture is a strange road music act. Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central goal of creation, but the film does everything in its power to abolish this notion. His mythological framework has no reference in human historical time. There are no human figures. When a boy is standing with a dog in the extended shot, the initial draft is from the boy's point of view; in the end it is a lot more dog. Likewise, a lizard is a stronger character than a person who introduces it, and a turtle partner hardly looks to his people with big fins. Animal stories and natural documents are always anthropomorphized, but Fata Morgana has nothing to do with it. Sure, dunes look like a female body, but the similarity is cut in both directions. Probably only people can easily distinguish between their creation and nature, and here the aircraft and factories are presented alongside mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilizations are part of a wider natural landscape. In 1979 Herzog gave a new idea for the idea when he remade Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
