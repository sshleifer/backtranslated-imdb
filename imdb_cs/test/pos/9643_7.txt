As I write these comments I watch the DVD of this movie that I just got from a mail order retailer, and I found it to hold very well, with strong characteristics, believable situations, and well staged action scenes <br /> <br It was a good 45 years, maybe 50 because I saw HELL BELOW, but one scene that made a very deep impression on me was the death scene of Sterling Holloway, mentioned by several other commentators. I haven't gotten to this scene yet, but I can vouch for what others have commented on: once you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you'll never forget it. Judging by how strong the film is still holding, I fully expect the scene to live in mind - as one of the greatest death scenes in the film's history. The film is worth seeing, but even without it it would be a first-class early submarine drama.
