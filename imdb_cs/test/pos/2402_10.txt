The Internet is a wonderful thing, isn't it? I look at the recorded episode of one of my favorite documentaries, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Thousand Wars", from my US DVR to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review of this series and I've just read another review from someone who lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I just want to say that Minh Nguyen has made a statement that America has brought war to Vietnam, is one-sided. I know America was the main player in the West, but two sides are needed to lead the war. The Soviets and the Chinese were the main weapons providers in the north, so why did Nguyen not mention them, because ignorance is partly to blame (well, I think we all know why he didn't mention them, either ignorance of uplift in the communist system and his political dogma, or because he is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested. Also, Mr. Nguyen, I think that parts of the north, the main aggressor of the war, have not been proven in your country to blame America for showing ignorance again. Regardless of his interesting reading from Vietnam (of course it could be, but I'll take it as real), at least the Communist East is somewhat open, as for the mini series, why do I like it? It was a war that began 15 years before America's involvement, and the series covers all aspects of history, so it's a real plus. The era is the first, all the Vietnam War programs you see will now use the same shots, so you're missing out on watching this older series. Another plus is this series. It's an interview with all the major players you can't do now because they're dead in old age, it's a major historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice as it differs from that of James Earl Jones and I think it is a very steep praise. I don't think you could find a better war document that would ever be done, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and moving it to the 1950s and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of World War II. Vietnam war. OK, I see some distortion, its subtle style, the gentle style of the '70s that is gentle, like the NPR "All Things Considered Bias", where it all looks so straightforward but when you blink you end up shaking your head. In this case, the cases of later episodes do not throw away a lot of light on the role of media and propaganda in general, all useful tools affecting the outcome of the war, NO THINK ????? The OIF War Veteran goes through the same thing 30 years later.
