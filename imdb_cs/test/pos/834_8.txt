It's a good movie. But you have to admit that Van Dame's recent films weren't that great. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore van dame fan, you should watch it as there is a huge improvement with battle scenes. Also, what I really love is beautiful music music. I'm sure it kills time if you're an action fan. As for Isaac Florentin, director of Undisputed 2, I don't think he did a good job like he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame movies hit the cinema before the DVD. Maybe one day :). Finally, it's worth a watch if you don't have any other action movies to watch, it could be your clock and half fun.
