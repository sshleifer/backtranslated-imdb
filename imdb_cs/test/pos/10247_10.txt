Some people may call "Cooley High" as well as "American Graffiti", but I wouldn't do it. For starters, in "AG", all were white, while in "CH" they are all black. In addition, this has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the film focuses on several African-American students in the working class in Chicago in 1964 and their opposites. The film focuses mainly on home life and relationships. In our apartments we see that there is never a father there. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest. One thing that really distinguishes this film from most other black people portraits is that teenagers in this film are portrayed as very responsible, disturbing. about missing school. Two really funny scenes are gorilla scene and one white guy in the movie. Overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It's really one of the best soundtracks in film history (we have it at home and on vinyl). A classic in the true sense of the word.
