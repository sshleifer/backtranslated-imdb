I saw Fame when she came out first. He deals with the high school class of 1980, which was my year of study. I saw the film in the summer between college and college, and when I acted as an artist myself, she has a special place in my heart. there are certainly some story lines that either are not completed or make no sense. However, these problems are more than offset by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. I saw it recently and I was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did for the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has some great music and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think Fame is tremendously better in developing her characters and the complexity of her stories. For anyone who really loves art, it's a necessary film.
