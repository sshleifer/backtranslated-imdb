Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24-year-old Dan Harris, is labeled "People are never as they seem". Perhaps it is wisely chosen as a marketing strategy; yet I rented this movie despite the brand, rather than because of it. And I'm glad I did it. I found a move that would inspire a tragedy. Personally, I found it to be a film about dream management: especially those that are lost. In the case of one son, "loss" requires a deep investigation of what he had, and did not, in his life. The central tragedy of the film, which in itself presents tempting questions, acts primarily as a background against which different coping styles are distinguished. I believe the film will ask an important question: how do we deal with our dreams, especially where heroes become imaginary?
