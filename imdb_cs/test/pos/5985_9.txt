This movie is a gem! It is the story of Juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in a large corporate office of the yogurt company, and Romuald, president of the same president. He won't notice her, he won't notice anyone until several conspiracies pull his company away from him and they all hit. He is lost, no one turns and no one believes when he discovers Juliette. As a cleaning woman, no one pays her any attention, so they say and do what's in it that she's smart enough to help her and help her helpless and unhappy boss. I've been paying attention to years on this DVD and seeing a previous comment about being released in September 2007 has raised my hopes. Unfortunately, I can't find a DVD, does anyone know if he was / was there?
