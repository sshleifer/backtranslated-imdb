One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and I'm glad I have a movie that reminds me why he was so amazing. Watch it with your children (or with your horse). The story of an old trainer with kids' shoes and his luck. If you've ever had or appreciate horse racing, you'll appreciate the rags of the story's riches. This may be a little under "Seabiscuit" but not much. The story is the same except for the fourth horse version. Well functioning, good racing conditions and equipment and nice racing scenes. Don't take the word for it, take it and create your own mind.
