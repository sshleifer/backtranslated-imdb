For the first time I saw this movie when I was about 6 ish - my grandmother thought it would be a nice boy who would like me and let me have a hard time ... however, every time I watched, I had nightmares in same night. Yes, it disguises it as a children's film, but even now I regard it as very dark, especially spooky music that is played every time a guardian angel woman is on the screen, and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The real "baddies" of the film, ie Sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc., didn't scare me at all, I always found the whole movie scary and dark. This is, of course, something I can appreciate now that I am 21 years old, but I do not have the experience to show it to my children!
