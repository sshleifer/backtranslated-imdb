It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either love or hate the reaction. You'll probably love or hate him. I think the best movies are the ones that divide people because they obviously have an impact. I'm in a five-member camp because this movie has made a real number for me and I wanted to go back and learn more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was completely tuned when everything was happening. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about it. The music through the movie was beautiful. I got lost in it, especially during some historical memories. Personally, I thought the sound was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speech, music, and radio was designed to make you feel like you're in RV with Jim, the main character, or the head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was on the radio. By the way, it's a very awesome DVD that made me cry.
