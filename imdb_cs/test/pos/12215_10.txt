Someone asked why it was canceled I tell you why Because "reality" makes money. the exhibition area was canceled so that it could be replaced by "reality", it will scare NBC, me and about half of my high school, a total of about 1000 people promised to boycott NBC until they bring this show back. in my area (I don't know about other places), but they had a great thing with Sci-Fi, where Sci-Fi would show the last week of the episode at 7:00 and then NBC would show a new week episode at 8:00 that was great, because he gave you a little repetition of what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled and they just left them on top of the church like that!
