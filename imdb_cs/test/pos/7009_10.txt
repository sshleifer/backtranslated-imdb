I'm 15, usually not my age children usually watch these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally dependent on how I first observed it. It's really good when you think about technology and movies at the time, music is great, the story is fine, choreography is great, it has to be seen. I don't know why there's a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie but I love classic love movies are much better than movies now! This film will make you smile, cry and start dancing. Music is absolutely smart and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel); Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that there is enough for the film - the original, the sequel and the third. In addition, people wont be bothered to watch it. Who remembers St Benard Beethoven? I think there are a total of 5 films.
