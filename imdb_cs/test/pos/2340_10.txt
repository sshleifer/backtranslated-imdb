Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provocative drama at its best. It means grasping, mood and captivity. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word to see it yourself. One Life Stand lets you consider your own lifestyle and the way you treat family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive performances are one of the best film experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a pleasure to give this deep and daring film a true touch of truth and realism. This is a film that cares and has honesty that is incomparable in recent years. No car chases, but a movie full of humus and emotion. For the first time I saw this film screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and I am happy to have a copy on DVD.
