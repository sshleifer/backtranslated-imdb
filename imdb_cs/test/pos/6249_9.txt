One of the weirdest, most remarkably scary and scary horror movies that came out of the 1970s, "Tourist Trap", even with free, free-wheeling, standards of "time goes", which are common in their time series as real strange things. Yet it is a very weird picture - a magically deployed miraculous atmosphere of the ubiquitous supernatural fear which of the get-go registers is powerfully haunted and becomes increasingly opaque and scarier as the film progresses and offers several shocks in the midst of a few scattered moments of surreal dream-like dreams elegance and ending bitterly ironic, overwhelmingly nihilistic remark with a scary final image that is hard to shake - making it a unique and uniquely radiating experience. Five teenagers traveling through the deserted California desert by car are hopelessly lost. They stumble through "Slausen's Lost Oasis", a dirty, neglected road dive that is one of the gas stations, three parts of a bewildered wax museum and all parts of ratta and premonition. The lonely, seemingly friendly and harmless owner of Slausen (Juicily Infected by Chuck Conners) turns out to be a wretched psychic with deadly telekinetic powers. Slausen brings her strange assortment of uncomfortably human-like mannequins to life and chooses children one by one to add them to her ever-growing collection of victims. Director David ("Puppermaster") "Coming" Schmoeller has adeptly written every last ounce of tension he can squeeze out of the pleasantly ambiguous and open script he wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (He said that the stubborn refusal of a script to give some rational apology to all the bizarre things that appear throughout the film, often incorrectly criticized as one of the major weaknesses of the film, is actually the key force of the film, giving the image creepy, anything and everything - Can it state that the common logic-damned quality of a real nightmare comes terribly to life that would never have been achieved had there been any credible explanation that is being offered for what's going on.) Pino Donaggio is a beautiful cooling, undervalued score, Nicholas Shadow cinematography von Sternberg and Robert A. Burns' rugged, cramped production design contribute immensely to the deeply disturbing film. Outstanding performances are another significant plus, with the pretty, lively Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner at "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"), particularly gentle and personalized as the most resilient and compassionate to endangered teens. Even Tanya Roberts is doing well as an unfortunate girl who has a knife in her head. Surprised and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is well worth a visit.
