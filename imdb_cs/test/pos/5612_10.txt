Entering the European film series Hal Hartley is one of his two or three best efforts so far, and fortunately one of the few available on DVD. Only in 63 minutes of running, my only question would be with Hartley, who will always leave more but never so much time. Martin Donovan is as wonderful as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting as Magdelena, but the highest point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley gives him a great dialogue and a chance to use his voice for full effect. Look at the three scenes where the microphone is waiting for him, as if he had a crazy slam to win. I have read more comments on this movie and I had to add mine because there is not enough praise to go around. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (opposite sex) and / or very clever biblical-based comedies, do it as quickly as possible.
