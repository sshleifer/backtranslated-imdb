I must say that it must be the best document I've ever seen in my life. First, I tell the movie at my friends' house and I didn't get a chance to watch it. From that moment, I spent my free time trying to find a movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, a friend of mine who knew I had the hardest time finding the movie got him as a gift. Sean Penn does a great job of telling a documentary. I loved how it told the story of every Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. Many times I was in Venice and around and I never knew what happened until I saw the document. I had no chance of seeing a real movie and I heard that he was nowhere to see what the document was. I don't know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
