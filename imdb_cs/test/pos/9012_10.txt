I've never been forced to write a review about anything, but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people just have to overcome the fact that voices are different. When you look at an episode, it never matters. Humor is original and while yes, some jokes are transmitted from the movie, they are delivered fresh. Some of them even remind Shrek - self-confident humor. Many of these jokes seem to be aimed at teens or original movie fans as well as teenagers. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both cheerful because they overcome their roles as Kronk and Yzma and their Annie Award nominations have been properly guaranteed. This exhibition takes some time to make love, to really get into the groove of "things, so to speak." If you ignore a terrible thematic song (which shouldn't really guarantee that in the way you judge the show because it's only 30 seconds of total product), this show is laughing and loud. any of the spirit of Emperor New Groove.
