I just watched this movie for the first time and loved it ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it's simple in his story, the sweetest love story and how every woman couldn't fall in love with Callum Blue beats me ... < The scenery in Italy was as you would expect, Beautiful, the poor lost in the end, and for the two lovebirds who met in the end, it was amazing, but the scene where a certain Italian swept the confetti after Eric's Wanda's wedding, perfection! Make a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better prepare the tissue and be fascinated, I know I was and hope to get it on DVD soon. All the actors played their games perfectly, it was a WW2 movie that you could trust because it was so realistic and without getting to the top like in other movies ...
