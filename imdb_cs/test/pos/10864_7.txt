The designation of this film "Lesbian Love Story" is about as accurate as the call of Pride & Prejudice "Direct Love Story". It's much more than that. Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is a classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to adulthood, from personal blindness to self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of the camp to the film's direction, but it is not an obstacle; rather it serves to underline the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life. Those who know the Chancellor of the BBC Pride and Prejudice will surely surprise her. Rachael Stirling is stellar as the main character of Nan, and Keeley Hawes is all wide-eyed goodness as her mistress Kitty Butler. The Chancellor could have a significant role, which is a party from Sally Hawkins, who plays Zen Butler. This movie is not for a weak heart, but it's not even pro-gay advertising. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story with impressive characters and well worth watching.
