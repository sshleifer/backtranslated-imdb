The words "hidden gem" have never been so precise. Lovers of bad movies could look for other hidden obscurities, sometimes comes short with things like Weasels rip my body, but other times, luck will win and you can end up with something like Death Bed, then hopefully it's not a bad movie at all, it just has A bad title, and not even a bad title, but a funny one that could throw you away, but Somehow Death Bed still goes into the "bad" category. With vibration that is dark and empty, Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved only to those lucky enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of vision. The deathbed includes a cohesive but interesting relationship between a demon in bed and a sympathetic spirit trapped in a portrait he wishes to save someone from the horrible fate that is absorbed by the yellow foam. Although it is not so scary that it's about the killer's bed, Death Bed has the qualities that make it for a successful horror. Dark, desolate atmosphere, confusion, scary, fine score and the dreamy quality that this masterpiece almost boasts of. Such quality or atmosphere usually appears unintentional. Not only is it intentional, but from what I have read, Death Bed comes from a real dream, George Barry, a director who has successfully translated the dream into a film, could only be accomplished by a genius. Old houses do for good quality horror as well as portraits, they are not sure what to do from killer beds with his killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, really. Also, it's not quite the B-horror mark I expected, considering the title and all. Before I looked at this gothic jewel, I was expecting something more like the Reunion Massacre, now it's a bad movie, if you saw it, you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above, I feel that Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but because it has stayed so dark for so long, we will say a bed that deserves nine.
