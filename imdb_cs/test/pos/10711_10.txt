I like this movie and I have a television programmed for recording when it reappears on November 2nd. It's a really nice love story with a twist. The song being played at the end of the movie is the one you wouldn't think would be a big hit, but it's a song that stays in your head and now I'm trying to find that song so I can hear and play it . I really don't have any style of concerts I see or songs I like to hear and open up new things with open minds. I would like to say that some parts of this film are not meant for the whole family. This film shows the skin. It's kind of like a lifelong film for women, about women. I say watch a movie and maybe you like it just like me.
