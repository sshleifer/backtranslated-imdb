This series when the Dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. The dinosaur looks very real and very realistic when they move. It is also very interesting how climate change is changing. I'm very interesting how dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interesting about how dinosaurs behaved. The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. Most interesting is why dinosaurs died and what happened afterwards. The BBC has made a great series of dinosaurs living and dying!
