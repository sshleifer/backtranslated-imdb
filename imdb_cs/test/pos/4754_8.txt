this movie has a great chase scene when you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other, it sounds very much like a movie bullet soundtrack, you will hear a 4-speed shift and will show you the brake pedal in the Roy Schneider, it's an automatic brake pedal! I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car they're in, like the kid! ........ The imposter who runs the garage is also the one in the first rocky movie, the rocky boss. a good movie! Also, when the door tears, you can see a guy sitting in the car, just waving an open door, a guy who helps him out of the car, what does Mr. Brady look like from Brady's crew?
