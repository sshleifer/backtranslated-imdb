What can I say? I got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half the first season and found it all. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives all the potential and at first I think it looks stupid. This must be the next best X-Files thing, but in my opinion, it never disappears. I'm telling you, it's scary and then thrilling and then soft. At the end you have Miles as a love puppy with a strange animal that is a new species. You have two people escaping from the authorities. And the tsunami killer who's about to strike! Wow! And I mentioned that Miles is a potential killer (the rest of his kind is). The surface is a brilliant turn and twist show that adds.
