Forget all those lousy romantic movies that include laptops and pairs that are locked to the lips. Forget all those shameless "dogs who give life to save the family," though I have to admit I have a soft place for them. Forget about Ricky Schroeder, who has already shown his tendency to overload at a tender age (now that he was one shameless!). This TV movie, which unfortunately never seems to be broadcast, is a master of all tear cracks, hands down. A well-written and well-functioning story. Ann-Margret had a great chance with this role. Nothing about her is glamorous or sexy, and this is a monumental success in itself. Based on a real story, Lucile Fray plays, the terminally ill mother who decides to fight until her dying breath finds good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as her husband, a good-natured but unreliable breadwinner whose crippling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for children. The film takes us through Lucilla's heartbreaking process of talking to potential parents and then watching her kids leave home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and the father - grieving at the tragedy that is taking place now, and who will follow it, and frustrated at its inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most surprising I've ever watched. Now I grew up as a "hopeless romantic" and spent many years having become a harder, cynical shell. Usually, it seems to me more than to feel into the sentimental film trip that works on us these days. But this jewel from the early 1980s still kills me. <br /> <br /> I really want someone with a marketing sense to release a DVD version of this drama. Special features include the Emmy Awards television broadcast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the Best Drama Actress Award went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what is to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a really drab show, Stanwyck broke into tears during his reception speech and fired: "Ann-Margret, I Love You!" That brought Ann-M to tears. <br /> <br /> Last note. The IMDb rating for "Who Will Love My Children" is 6.4 from this writing. However, over 75% of the rating is in the 8-10 range (mostly 10's). Regardless of the kind of handicapping system that this site uses to adjust the overall ranking of IMDb movies, the tag on this page is missing. This one is a "bullet" of all time and a brave good TV movie.
