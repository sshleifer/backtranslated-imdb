I loved this movie completely ... So many emotions in so little time. I loved the beginning and how it will throw you away. I love the story and the deer that is brought in. I know when I think of deer, I think of innocence and prosperity. Also in Psalm 42: 2 in the Bible it says, "Like deer trousers for water streams, and my trousers pants for you, O God." Which could even combine the last moment a woman says it will be fine. As if she knew she was going with God. Maybe I'm thinking about how to get involved. But sometimes it is interesting to see what is happening in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with the audience everywhere. I live in Texas and play on the cable ... I immediately got into the computer to learn more about this movie and this amazing director! I really liked the music that was used in the background. Music can sometimes create or break a movie. Definitely set the mood. Very nice choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. Laetitia
