Good shows, really good performances and the director will take us in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially because there are basically two people in the room. It's not a race through as many modern movies, but neither drag. Bohl is pretty flippant to believe her in "now" her character, who is still involved and does not go back to her "career" choices - so she is credible without having to show her deep, self-examination Her soul ... Brundage has a delicate balance between weight, innocence, humility and class to get rid of "Buddy" very well. A little grainy on the quality of the movie, but it matches the tone of the story. He could use a little polishing for the hair and make-up end things, but it's definitely worth watching.
