The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, which is a unique environment where Germans hold a few British agents in a British house. Because they aren't technically at war, it seems both sides have to realize what's coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape to the landscape and part. One evening, Milland becomes Marlene Dietrich, a Gypsy woman, when she is alone in the camp where she prepares dinner. Their meeting is an amazing and captivating scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness into a whole new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but remains determined to fulfill his mission in terms of the location of a scientist who knows the pattern of a new gaseous poison, but who is also not a Nazi. Hollywood life in Gypsy life and customs is predictably depicted, but the basic knowledge that it would be one of the goals for the extermination of the Nazis adds some tension. The film straddles the line between a serious poison gas story and an urgent search for a formula, and a colorful, though not very convincing, love story between Milland and Dietrich. But they are both very good. it is a film mistake that has not even given them their relationship enough dramatic realism, relied on and used obvious cultural differences for controversial comedy purposes. However, there and there are some tense and interesting points, a surprising encounter with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich makes a great palm of reading and Milland almost like a good pretend one, and the Germans dinner different stripes on which Announcement comes over the radio that Germany she was attacked by Poland and everyone stands and makes a stiff shoulder. Mitchell Leison might have missed some opportunities here, but he took full advantage of others.
