This typical teenager movie is one of the best, besides the story being good, the music is well accompanied by the movie all the time. Although I do not like the classic film, if it is not a classic and better written script, this is exceptional. Maybe the style and language of the hair should change a bit, in the 1980s, I believe that offensive language is rarely heard. <br /> <br />
