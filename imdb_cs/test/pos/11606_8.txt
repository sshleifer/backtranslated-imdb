I saw a 2-hour version of Choker Bali. I can't say long. The movie has a certain natural pace towards it and does not seem to delay anytime. Costume and set remind us of what we could see in old movies. Aishwarya Rai did a good job. It is a really mature role with enough space to act in the story. The scenario also very well supports the story. Aishwarys acts as an unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such character and conflict faced by the oppressed state of widows in these times. Her best friend in this movie is also Raima Sen. -work. Her innocence and admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and educated behavior was very well done. These are really some of the prevailing ideas of that time. We see how far we came from such an era! The film talks about the liberation of women as a fine story line. I found that the storyline is very similar to the Ghare Bahire written by Tagore. This makes the rope in some action from the struggle for independence and contrasts the struggle for Indian independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> Well made film is definitely worth watching. Aishwarya acts: par excellence. Rituparna handled the story with great care. Another classic from Rabindranath Tagore.
