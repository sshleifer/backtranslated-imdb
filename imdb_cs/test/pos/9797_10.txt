I'm a 20 year old block from England. I'm not going to say movies. But this moved me. I cried like a girl! This is the most moving movie I've ever seen, even though the story was controversial. Joseph Mazell's small face, when he dreams of crying, always sobbed. How could such a wounded boy hurt? I'll cry and think about it! Notable.
