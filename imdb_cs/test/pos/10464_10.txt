This film embodies the soul of a modern "elite" foodculture, although the film is 17 years old. The constant principle of the film is: Food is more than just a nutritious substance. It is also a powerful symbol and medium for the culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food, being inspired by idealistic ideas and culture, embarking on their Puritan ways and ways to deny passion. Karen Blixens shortstory uses the distinction between North European and Southern Europe to highlight their different approach to food. As strict and somewhat boring Scandinavians get an infusion of "Eros" from the south, the party goes. So what are you waiting for? Look at it ..... again!
