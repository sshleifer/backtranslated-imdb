Do-It-Yourself India Horror Author Todd Leaves Returns With Another Fun Cruel Nickel'n'dime Shot-On-Video Clunker This is basically just a faint excuse for hanging around a lot of watery blood and glowing intestines as often as possible . An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as a harsh zombie that struggles with rot, so they can enjoy life. A bunch of college bickering, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by a strange malt (Byron Nichodemus, who veiled her into an offensive degree), two equally wild sleazeball hoodlums and three hottie sisters. this terrifying suffering. This is for an unnecessarily confused and conspicuous plot, but fortunately, what this merrily scary scarecrow lacks in narrative coherence (more), it more than compensates for the delightful amount of beautifully gross "gore". Disgusting highlights include a woman who has cut off fingers, deadly shots for a youthful youth class, attempted rape of necrophils, eviscerated, and, of course, a more repulsive tear off before you can shake a pile of wet gut. In addition, we also have a rough, grainy cinematography that alternates between faded colors and dirty black-and-white, unnoticed staged scenes, miserable talks from a unified pathetic no-name casting (Jerry Angell, especially cops, crazy top thespic). disgracing his immensely abysmal history as a Slim no-count psycho criminal Joe Bob), grating his head-banging thrash metal soundtrack, and generic shivery'n'omin 'synthesizer score. Let's not forget the absurd end in which several of our survivors have come across several vials of bacteria that feed on the meat that are used in the undead mountains. Sure, this movie is pure dreck, but it certainly has an incredibly nasty quality that makes it a great dose so awful - it's an amazing Grade Z fun for the hardcore freak bad fare fare.
