A classic film from the late 1950s. Promising headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not in the best possible way, but the direction, cinematography and acting of the younger cast are convincing. In the sense of the 50s (which I love). The look and feel of contemporary film "Far from Heaven" of timeless art (transcending art) reflects precisely this kind of film (and I think this film may be one of the models). Stupid storyline, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But like a movie - famous! As a reflection of society, very interesting. And as a witness to how Hollywood breaks away from the idealistic depiction of American sexual mores, fascinating.
