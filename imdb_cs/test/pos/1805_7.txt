I have seen this film several times and every time I look at it, it is funnier and fun. Perhaps his lack of research that went into the character of Nicolas Cage is a 'punk' persona, or just a cheesiness factor because it was so typical of the eighties movie ... however it is a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. I think it's right there with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (quintessence of eighties flicks!)
