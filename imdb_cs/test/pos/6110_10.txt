After watching Desperate Living, I was addicted to John Waters' films. I heard about the Pink Flamingos and I had to watch it and the kid was worth it! Believe what you hear, it's waste! It's full of everything dirty, which is actually the main story of this movie. Contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken shagging, nudity (like you've never seen before - beware of children's birthday entertainment entertainers), poo eating, arson, garbage trailers, perversion, transexuality, egg fettish, cross dressing ... .. you get a picture. Above all, it is a necessity! Just watch out for the birthday entertainers and Divine was thinking around the park!
