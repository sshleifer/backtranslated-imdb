Many funny scenes about people you usually don't pay attention to in the movie and what they have to do to get the job done and what happens when they do it. Lou Myers was very funny as Half-Step Wilson. Anyone who has a fixed group of friends can relate to many non-film scenes scattered throughout the film.
