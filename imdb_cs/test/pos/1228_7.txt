I'm not here to tell you that "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. No way. The referenced directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("Warriors"). These two helmets couldn't be deceived by the beauties as they put women in their movies. No skirts need to pay. They unapologetically made the guy movies. Weapons, lots of weapons. Men encountered violent death with jaw jerks. Their films were like sap to head. Want a friend? Get a dog. "Armored" is such a guy movie. Duel armored cars? Bloody gunshot wounds? Exploding Money? If the lizard doesn't make your brain excited, then keep moving. After 88 minutes, "Armored" is the whole muscle without an ounce of fat. We meet six guards who drive armored cars, three on a truck. Six, led by Matt Dillon, is planning a fake kidnapping involving two trucks. One day, their mission is to deliver $ 42 million from a federal reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks to the warehouse, hide the money and then try the kidnapping. Sure, the cops will suspect them, but if they stick together, they'll go through it. The problem is that one of six Columbus Short is a holdout. First. But he faces eviction. And he's a guardian for his young brother. He needs bad cash. Matt Dillon cajoles, please, convinces holdout. No blood on anyone's hands. Clean Escape. All good, nothing wrong. You will be forever rich. The blue sky is smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. Of course everything goes to hell. It's one damn thing after another and the stakes are still rising. And almost everything happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film goes out of its way to a background project of industrial urban decline. I like the industrial decline of cities. Kudos to Matt Dillon, who plays the best bad dog. He goes from charming to disappointed frustrated to outraged to the utterly shocking crazy during the movie. I love this guy. Such credit is due to the menacing, pulsating, blistering, and utterly sinister electronic soundtrack of John Murphy. I guess he heard some Tangerine Dream records. It is also surprising that it is a PG-13 movie. Did I catch him? one! ?? f-bomb in this movie about violent thieves. I like it at some level. Take your children. The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian player who has created a fine noir in the Budapest metro system "Kontroll". The screenwriter is nothing from the name of James V. Simpson. Many people are just starting out in this movie. I am willing to bet that respect for this film will grow as time goes on and these filmmakers advance their careers.
