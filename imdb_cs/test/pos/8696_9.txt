So many early British movies I've seen on video suffer from poor print quality or bad sound or both. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy of this film in a video of excellent quality, which allowed me to focus on the story itself. And it was an excellent story. At first glance, the passengers on the unfortunate bus looked very boring (except for the beautiful Jessie Matthews). However, as the film returned to show each passenger's story the day before the accident, I found that the cast, unlike the initial appearance, is a talented group of performers skillfully directed to bring true individuality to its individual characters. . Spectators can have different preferences that two travelers meet the tragic end and survive. But the film keeps your interest because it assures you. This film deserves a much wider audience - a real jewel of early British film.
