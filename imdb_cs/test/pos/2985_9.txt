I'm sure the US people don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I don't think they can talk about what they don't know. And he must realize that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the US. The only places where sexy girls are illegal are the US and Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it is 14. In Spain it is 12. So teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years of age, do nothing illegal. Nudity is not considered a major problem in almost all civilized countries. And only a lunatic could consider teenagers' love to be a nuisance to children.
