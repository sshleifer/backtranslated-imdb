This upset and angry film is against not only the war during which it was created, but the whole war. No matter what the war is. It could be the most emotional experience I've ever had with the work of Ingmar Bergman. These two main characters in this dramatic drama have no parties that would not be any point in any solemn symbolism according to Bergman's usual, but clearly show people and their lives and exercises that Bergman has already proven to understand the human response. to film. His top-class relay, Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow, play an internalizing but bickering couple who was once orchestra musicians. They now live in a weathered farmhouse on the island. Part of the building's frustration with these two people abound in detail that nothing in their house is working. They are not even intellectuals themselves. They are rather familiar marriages that have more or less resigned to life and are essentially apolitical; they get only the wind of distant rumors of the war that takes place forever. Ullmann deals with the danger to their lives and the desire to carry children. Her husband, Von Sydow, shrugs for the war. Their equanimity is interrupted by the screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of paratroopers, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisitions, and finally their capture by what appears to be a local party, but loyalty has long been fragmented. They are sent back to their home, witnessing unjustified destruction and suffering the vengeful consequences of such a terribly distrustful marriage. This, one of my favorite Bergman's endeavors, is a study of the couples that have emerged from their safe self-confident life, which has been violated by manipulative despair, by testing both to reveal who they really are. To some extent, he lacks compassion, too self-service, and restless to suffer patience, because his whimsical schisms are crying. His suppressed emotional problems led to the suppression of the initiative and the excitement that attracted them. Extremely last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of stunning gray sky, is one of Bergman's closest real emotions. All systems of dogma and belief are in this very important and indispensable environment. positive portrait. Essentially distinct personalities of the characters of Ullmann and Von Sydow are thrown into the degenerate war world because they are accused of being "sympathizers," but the film shot on the small little island of Bergman in Faro does not provide any information about where or when it is set who are both sides and what they are fighting for. If a non-participating civilian finds himself in between, the knowledge base is likely to be very similar. Ullmann and Von Sydow aren't sympathizers for an apparent enemy, but they're partisans who seem to be their side. This 1968 reactive allegory could be about ordinary involuntary citizens of Iraq, Kosovo, Vietnam, Israel or Palestine, or ...
