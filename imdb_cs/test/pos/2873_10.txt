This Horror movie is definitely one of the best I've ever seen in life, and there are many reasons why. The storyline is really good, it has a lot of actions and great horror sequences in it The actors aren't very good, but they're not that bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor, but he was always a good actor. as Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan as Tye, Samantha Noble as Kira etc. I also have to warn you that killing scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but just doing better and you can't have horror without blood and gore. they look very realistic. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed when you don't see evil because it's a really good movie. So make sure you rent or buy to see no evil because it's so great. <br /> <br /> Total score: ********** of ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** Except **** *
