Universal Studies. The name evokes so many memories of the fearsome fans of beautiful matte paintings ... er ... landscapes, hazy veiled countrysides, full moons, howling wolves, taverns and torches controlling crowds. Yet it is quite strange to look at these films, how little the era that has produced the true classics has lasted. The 1930s had masterpieces, but they were mostly from the same directors, and many of their films are now mostly historical. The 40 'produced more thoughtlessly fun matinée movies before it did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of Gothic horror movies ended in 1945 with the' House of Dracula ', stumbled around with Abbott & Costello's comedy, and was officially dead in the fifties and the advent of the atomic age. So it is strange that perhaps one of the most beautiful Gothic Gothic was made in the 1950s! This in itself makes the film special, because costume dramas were on the way out of the University of Economics. It may not be comparable to all the classics like James Whale movies and 'The Wolfman', but damn it condenses all the fun elements of these movies into one delicious treat! Prepare for nothing but pure fun! Since many social morals have changed, the film also indulges in violence that would not have been permitted in earlier periods; there is no blood, but we see the figures shot and stabbed directly, and there is also a burning torch on the face! The film doesn't have to be a horror movie but it certainly has the atmosphere, the look and the feel of one! It begins at night at night with howling winds (and wolves) as the two men sealed the tombs of two apparently dead young lovers, but WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he can't move! He's trapped, but he speaks quietly in his own mind, unable to communicate! What's his story? Now it's how to start a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> English entrepreneur Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, who gives one of his best performances) sets out under the nickname of Richard Beckett to explore the disappearance of two of his friends, who disappeared into the castle of the one-eyed Count von Bruno (see Sacha Baron Cohen?). It seems that many years ago, Von Bruno, as a god, stood in Africa to steal ivory, was exposed to Burton's men, and the natives disfigured him. Now he has a desire for revenge. The film has all the clichés, a ride by Jonathan Harker to the castle, an inn full of watchful villagers, a deadly trap, and a mighty man (Lon Chaney Jr.). The scenes of the torture chamber are truly thrilling, including a panel in the floor that activates the dungeon door (which is later for a sophisticated escape), hunting expeditions involving imported panther (!!!) and even an alligator pit! And then there is a false Romeo & Juliet-style death that leads to the film's prologue .... <br /> <br /> The story is a cliché and the world view is black and white. But it's still incredibly fun, with director Nathan Juran, who makes every scene a pile of atmosphere and is fresh and new. There are also several fences. Why does Ronald try to leave the castle so soon? And he will never solve the mystery of what happened to his friends, even though it is obvious, but he does not know when he gives up and it seemed to be earlier. Oddly. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Despite being rude, Burton is one of the most sympathetic protagonists I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as a Countess "peasant wife" who becomes Burton's love interest, can have a stereotypical "fall in love" look at the problem of all the film heroes of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman in a marriage without love for a sadistic monster is very convincing, also shows the suspicion and testimony of several film heroes of this era, even seeing Burton's forced attempt to reassure her (And to hit the necklace, even if it is an analysis of how important it is) as a rape attempt but in her paranoia she never seems ugly, the audience sympathizes with her. Even though he fails to make Von Bruno look truly alien and worldworldly (he is a villain in a horror movie after all), Stephen McNally gives a really cool performance as a sadistic nobleman. When she reveals her burned eye and laughs maniacally, it is really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also great as his Garment mench henchman. But the best performance is undoubtedly Boris Karloff as a mysterious physician. Meissen. At first she has little time on the screen but steals every scene she is in. It is a performance that is both scary, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic. When he is angry when he applies leeches to one of Bruno's followers, spies on our hero and speaks in the famous "you know I'm no good" voice that only Karloff could do, you wonder if he is a hero or villain , always skulking about them. And while it acts as the main agent of our hero's escape, it still shows human fragility, such as greed and fear for its own life, even the cold-blooded annoying men for Burton's benefit, before Burton even agrees. His plan to help our hero and escape the hero also puts them right in the clutches of Von Bruno, because he prepares for them an incredibly sadistic (if incredibly wrong) death that must have inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe. They don't have to have much time on the screen, but it's easily one of Boris's best performances. While the end may seem sudden and anti-climatic to some, half of the fun is getting there, and there is a lot of excitement to be. Kick back and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's fun to escape at the best.
