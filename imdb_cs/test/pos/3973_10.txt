I went into this thinking with another rough film with rough humor. I don't like the humor of my first sentence, and this movie had moments, but I loved it. Justin Long has never really done such a comedy where he is sarcastic and clever and I loved her. Lewis Black .... Enough. The end I really loved because it had to take it seriously, I mean, how else would you end it? Yes, this is another story story, but not in your typical format, and the film was not their ups and downs, it was people who came together for one common goal to go to college where they were recruited. The cast was amazing and yes, I laughed loudly when I didn't think I'd be laughing longer than I thought. Parents and sisters played their roles well, but their characters are deployed if necessary. The film wasn't focused around them, but at the same time they appeared when you expect it and don't expect it. They played the story very well, and I loved the famous faces of Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added something to her that made him even more enjoyable as well as friends B. I recommend this movie to someone who hated the rough comedies of the past 4 years and really wants something with humor and a story!
