Here is a much less known science fiction of the 1950s with a little different twist. The atomic researcher's son is kidnapped and detained for the Father's ransom atomic secret. It is a tightly woven atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values ​​and above-average acting, even from a boy. Atomic City actually has the film feeling unlike a lot of the other 50 sci-fi this time that came out more like a TV show episode. Atomic City was also really nominated for the Academy Award for Best Screenplay - how many other sci-fi 50 players can win an Oscar nomination? Great stimulation, tight direction and some great locations in the real Atomic City of Los Alamos, New Mexico, make this worth the hunt. Collectors printing in circulation is an above average transfer and is a great double feature with atomic man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
