Rose and the Good Doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that is quite impossible to float in orbit just below the black hole. The station's crew is as confused as the two new residents. Suitably creepy in its atmosphere and better when the doctor and roses find themselves trapped due to circumstances beyond their control and speak through the obedient alien race of Ood, something quite dark comes from under the planet's crust. I do not see the second part of this double-card, I cannot guarantee that the end is just as strong. But it does for one hell of a beginning. <br /> <br /> My Class: A
