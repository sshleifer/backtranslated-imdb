Burt Reynolds directed this action movie and (surprise!) He is actually a pretty good director. This film begins well as Burt's attempt at busting a drug dealer is dirty, and he is downgraded to vice president. Casting the file has pretty funny scenes because Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his co-workers together and Charles Durning loses control of his team. More Vice Meets Cost-Effective Call-Ring That Could Have Something to Do with Many Murders. Sharkey spends her days hushing Dominoe's apartment (Rachel Ward) and really begins to adore her from a distance. Dominoe is murdered as he approaches the leader of the crime. I'm not going to give out any surprises on the property, but the first hour of this movie is great. Unfortunately, the script gets very clich√© and incredible after that. Why would Burt Reynolds face the head of crime with his great secret? Sure it does make a man sweat, but that causes many more cops to be killed. And it is not believable that Dominoe and Sharkey would love each other after they know each other, much less when their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to the entire police who ran into the building with our heroes? Isn't there a SWAT team? In fact, the film never tells you how all the militants are connected, and why they have to kill so many people. At the end of the ship is a very effective scene of torture. a movie that is probably the only really nail scene of the movie. It is a pity that the peak is a typical shoot-em-up. Still, this movie is certainly fun if you love crime and action movies. Don't think about a hole, and you'll have a good time.
