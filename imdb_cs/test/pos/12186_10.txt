I remember that I don't like this movie when I first saw it, but it has grown on me. I like costumes and presents actors, humor, cinematography, soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and move very fast. Every time I look at it, there's something new that interests me. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that will destroy her, but not enough. Also Lestat in this movie is different, it's not the same character. You see, the Armand character was given Lestat-like qualities because I'm assuming Anne wanted it, but there's no reason why this film should be just because it's not like books, it's fascinating in itself.
