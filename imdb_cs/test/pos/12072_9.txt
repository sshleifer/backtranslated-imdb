During the end of this movie I am blubbered as a little girl and I dare not hold anyone else without a sob. Absolutely heartbreaking things, but uplifting in their core. A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who plays a mortally ill mother of ten who knows that her arthritic steel husband will not be able to support the family when she is gone, arrange for her children to be accepted before shuffling. The role really deserved an Oscar. You really feel for this poor family because the dying mother gives her everything to make sure her children don't end up in a badly managed state system. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it before - take it if you can.
