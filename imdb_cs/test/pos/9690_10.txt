Jackass Number Two is the most enjoyable movie of 2006, which also beat the cheerful Clerks II. It's one of the best sequels in recent memory, defeating Jackass The Movie in every way. Now this movie may be the funniest, but it's also the most offensive, scary and utterly disgusting. In the course of the film you find yourself sick several times. I am absolutely serious when I say that I am nothing but watching or during this movie because it is likely that it will literally come back to haunt you. Keep drinking to a minimum as well. You have been warned because, like the slogan he says, he will beg for mercy. Jackass Number Two followed by crazy men from hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Marger, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo , and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab himself' Raab is absent) because they perform the worst life-hardening and rebellious pieces imaginable. I'm not going to say what stunts are, but I warn you that any scene with an animal will be scary or mentally frightening, and that one member (again not speaking) will flirt with death several times. film. What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining are not the stunts themselves, but how often they react to them and to them. If you want to simplify it, if you love it and have a blast, you'll also be (that is for 99% of the bits). All stunts are very original and 90% of them are never seen. You will witness several recycled, but they are strengthened. You don't think a movie like this is really going, but it does; Jeff Tremain's direction makes the film so much fun as it provides a guideline for the gang in their comedic timing, which is just brilliant on his side. He could just sit and sleep all the time (in the movie you actually saw him sleeping over some filming), but he went there and helped those crazy guys to do stunts as wittily as he could. I gave Mr. Tremain two inches. Another great thing about Jackass is his bonanza celebrity portraits, and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers and Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor, and \ t director / actor Mike Judge (Office Space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the most entertaining in the film, as it is even more fun to see these men as part of the film. Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally humiliating, and simply plain bad movies of all time, if not the most. Despite this, he is so original and so cheerful that you won't worry about it. You will be gasping for air, laughing so hard that you will cry and jump from your seat and laugh throughout the movie. Given the explicit and potentially disruptive graphic content of this film, no one younger than 18 should watch this movie. You were warned. I hope you like Jackass Number Two just like me. 10/10 --spy
