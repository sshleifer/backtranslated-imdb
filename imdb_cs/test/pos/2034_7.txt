I was looking forward to the release of this film since I first heard this concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I'm not going to bother summarizing the story because everyone else has, but I'll say it was just plain fun all the time. The performances were great as well as music, and the main characters were nice. My only complaints are: (1) The story was definitely missing; The film packed very hard - in fact, in the second half of the year, the writing became quite lax, as if the writers were unsure of what to do with the chart. As the storyline wasn't as important as music and action, it didn't really affect the fun value of the movie, so it's not as serious a complaint as it would seem. This is really nitpically, but the music that the characters in the movie listened to was sometimes dated back to 1985 when the movie was set. INXS 'Devil Inside has been since 1987 and AC / DC's Are Ready has been since 1990, among others. It bothered me a bit because they probably went to length to do a piece of the period, they could check the copyright date of these songs to make sure they were in 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big deal. Oh, I thought of something else that was strange. Steel Dragon members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and guitarist Ozzy Zakk Wylde were members of the band, each with a few talking lines in AMERICAN accents. It was also a bit lazy, but it was still cool to see real musicians playing musicians, so I forgive that. <br /> <br /> I could suffocate all day, but I don't want to give the impression that it wasn't a super fun movie. I probably buy a DVD when it comes out, and I'm sure to buy a soundtrack CD just for six Steel Dragon songs (some of which have been singed by Steelheart if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was perhaps a great excursion when Mark Wahlberg lipsynching on a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "Good Vibes" Mark Mark and Funky Bunch. The surprise look of Mark's face is invaluable. Classic rock and roll movie! Score: 8/10 thanks to extreme fun
