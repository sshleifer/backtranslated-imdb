I love watching the miles of Jericho. I mean watching Peter Strauss run a mile is like watching usain screw sprint 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and he should do another running movie. The fast lightning has great energy and can run for a mile in 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can't blow the rain Murphy I think a man runs 80 miles a week no one does, but he. I watched Jericho mile 100 times and will see it's 100 more. great movies are being watched more than movies that aren't. I would like to thank the creators of this film for living the years of life there to become. They are great people and I bless them all.
