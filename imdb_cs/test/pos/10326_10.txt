The whole civilized world already knows that Emil Sitka says his immortal "Hold your hands, you lovebirds". Shemp Howard, music professor, steals the show. Watch him hoping Dee Green breaks "Spring Voices". Watch Shemp as he shaves a mirror hanging on the ceiling with a string. Look at him when he finds himself in Christine McIntyre's chair. Watch him and you will laugh and learn. Moe is not even slouch. Watch him trying to get a woman to sit on a bear trap. Larry, as usual, is a Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the best Stooge shorts. You won't find one weak moment.
