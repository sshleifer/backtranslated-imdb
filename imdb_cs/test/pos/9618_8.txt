Five Fingers of Death: Although the previous episode of Shaw's martial arts has shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, none of them have given such an open tribute as this, especially in the saloon battle scene. And though Shaw Bros. the films have borrowed from the Japanese genre chambara (swordfight) before, no one has done so with such success. I think that some of this has to do with the director's coming from Korea, and so he has brought a non-Chinese perspective to these loans, which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film featured true innovations in technology and technology in Hong Kong action films. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera has been given access to the entire file, which included footage from many different angles, such as the low-angle interior, which shows the ceiling of the room (the original American innovation, from which American innovation comes). usually attributed to John Ford), or a high angle long shot, which allowed the visualization of a large ground area, or front viewing shot. It is true that it was not the first hand-to-hand combat film of a real film substance - it is Wang Yu's Chinese boxer; but on a commercial level, Shaw Bros. he was right to choose 'five fingers' as their first major release to the west because, one might say, it was 'least Chinese' of their action films, that is, the least dependent on purely Chinese theatrical tradition. Although this made no impression on American critics at the time (who universally swept the picture), it was not lost on American viewers, especially among African Americans, whose culture was always - necessarily - an eclectic mosaic of borrowed elements and innovation. In the "five fingers" they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story, in a serious young man who was forced to make further efforts to overcome social barriers and betrayal to realize his merits. It seems to be a universal issue for modernity, but every culture has its own way of expressing and resolving it; "Five Fingers" presented him as many Americans could get to know him as well as the Chinese. So is the film just a historical value now? Definitely not. For one thing, this problem has not disappeared. Secondly, some of the news leaves most of the film today as fresh as it was in the first edition. Also, the action is well staged and performances, although a bit more serious, are sharp. The film is too long, but the story covers a lot of space. And there are amazing sets, such as the saloon confrontation, the fight to the competition, the odd double final. <br /> <br /> definitely looks better on the theater screen but still impressive for home watching: recommended.
