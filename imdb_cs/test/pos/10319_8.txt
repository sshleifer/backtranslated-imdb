For the record, I'm a curly fan through and through. But I have to say that in fact Shemp wasn't so bad. Yeah, maybe he missed the same grotesque that Curly had, but in a way he was cheerful. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a professor of music (Stooge? Professor? Yeah right) who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle and Moe & Larry must prepare him to marry a woman by six night or no money. <br /> <br /> It was one of the first sheaves to be recycled. material. No wonder Shemp was part of the Stoogs before Curly entered the picture, so it seemed natural. Slapstick gags are fun, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Basic Stooge short to be honest.
