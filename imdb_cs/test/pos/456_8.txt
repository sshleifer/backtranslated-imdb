Yul Brynner's Major Surov, singing, dancing, vodka-drinking Russian officer based at the Austro-Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatole Litvak's tour. Although the film is still to be released on video or DVD, it remains one of the most convincing performances of Brynner. Due to political unrest, a group of passengers cannot fly from Budapest, but on a bus to Vienna. But before they reach the border, their passports are taken and detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surov. The Major has reason to believe that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the Hungarian fighters. the group is smuggled out of the country. Lady Ashmore hides the mysterious passenger Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.), who pretends to be an American but does not destroy anyone. He mainly helps Fleming pay off the debt he owes her because of the problems caused by the past association. Other travelers include British journalist Robert Morley, an American family playing E.G. Marshall, his wife, Anne Jackson, and their two children, one of which is the little Ron Howard's debut. Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr), and romance develops among them. He gives him nothing but contempt and stiff upper lip, even though we suspect he is still beating under her heart. The Cold War idea and the mighty deed carry the story, but romance is never quite convincing. It remains, however, one of my favorite movies Yul Brynner and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance.
