The focus of the key relationship in the life of a young man, his relationship with his father, has been superbly portrayed in this film as "The Greatest Game They've Ever Played". The film captured the essence of how important it is for a father to confirm his son and let him know that he has what is needed to follow his dream. It didn't matter that the economic and social class of mores introduced obstacles that both father and son must overcome. Nor did it matter that the other son was celebrating in a lush celebration. The most important thing was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval. The real life challenge for both father and son has been fulfilled. Given that in real life the hero of the story retained his amateur status and became an entrepreneur, he largely verifies that all that was before the game was a training place for a valid father-son relationship.
