Some movies want to think, some want to excite us, some want to excite us. But sometimes, the film wants us to just laugh, and "In & Out" will surely succeed in this department. Indiana high-school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) will be married to fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) in three days, but the city is more excited about the Oscar nomination of former Cameron Drake resident ). But when Cameron wins the Oscar for playing a gay soldier, thanks to his gay teacher Howard for inspiration. What follows is Howard denying it in a funny set of misfortune in a truly screwball fashion. Kevin Kline is great, radiating homosexual stereotypes. Joan Cusack has a really great talent to climb. Debbie Reynolds is as cheerful as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also hoof as homophobic director. Gay scriptwriter Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows stereotypes and uses them in a way that is mostly tolerant of conservative Midwesterners and yet mostly harmless to homosexuals. It's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and harmless, and certainly a step from the previous year's The Birdcage.
