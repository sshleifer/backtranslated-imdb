What can I say? A small child inside always has great affection for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a stupid, megalomaniac villain, and this film brings all the numbers. As an adult, it is easy to point out many of the shortcomings in this film and say it's really just a bunch of episodes taken from a children's TV series that is linked together. Despite all this, I consider the end very mobile and content surprisingly grown in nature. Huge fun when it's a little pointless sometimes.
