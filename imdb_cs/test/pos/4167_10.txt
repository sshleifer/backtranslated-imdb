A surprisingly big cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and his ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently I could watch them all again, a great voice from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche in different roles. The only qualification I had was the voice of Rob Paulson, who was too old for the title character, but it was no bigger, because the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great ending. Some people say it was a kick-out, but I find it refreshing compared to many series that just let things hang. Hopefully one day they will put this series on DVD, unfortunately it came out at a time when the DVD was still not prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy that I never thought of despite a fun career.
