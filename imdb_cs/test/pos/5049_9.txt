To qualify my use of "realistic" in summary, not many old people I know go around pretending to be famous maestros, blind people, etc. - nor have I ever been older. These minor problems of the journey, the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed in it were absolutely realistic and real. In fact, even though we are not yet 30, I have seen many qualities of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those who are not dying young (there is a lot of that in the film when two best friends talk about dying young people and one of them says - and I paraphrase, we missed our chance - we have to endure it), we'll all be there where are these characters for a day. I know that many moviegoers would rather leave the reality that would be contrary to being * confronted with it, but they could also look forward to a sweet reminder of our mortality - and the importance of life to the full-- that this movie is.
