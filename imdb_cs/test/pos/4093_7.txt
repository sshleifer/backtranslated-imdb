I have to compensate all the horrible comments. I love this movie. I own a movie and a soundtrack. I look at it whenever I need to pick me up. It's true it's not like the sound of music, but it's so fun if collecting in movies isn't your thing. I loved late (and great) Bobby Vann and James Shigeta always have and will always be a favorite. I saw it when he first came out in theaters. I'm a big music fan and this is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It is a modern musical and should not be judged by all who have gone before. It's just the best for dreamers like me who want to find this place - no sickness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a good movie. That's what all the movies should be about. Shaun Phillips' title track is excellent and explains the whole film feeling. If acting isn't the biggest one who cares. I like the idea of ​​a movie. Peter Finch, a very tough actor, Liv Ullmann, as beautiful as ever, Sally Kellerman, a surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, overwhelming, all convinced me that these are the normal course of mill people. Neither of them in the film kept as actors. They acted like real people, just as I would if I found this place. Torn between returning home and staying there, in amazement of everything. Yes, there are shortcomings in this movie, but overcome it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a good musical!
