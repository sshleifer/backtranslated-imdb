A good drama movie about a childcare case with great performances by all actors. A good example of what an excellent scenario can do to power a simple story to a much higher quality. The screenplay was just average, and that's what kept the movie from a list of all the best dramas. something longer though for more perfection but it would really be nitpicking ......
