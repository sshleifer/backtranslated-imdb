Okay, I'm crazy. I loved it. I had no expectations and I had them all fulfilled. It was a horrible movie. I loved it. I managed to wear a DVD of use. No one can understand my obsession. I can't even tell the truth. For those who have seen the movie, it comes as no surprise, but I asked a video store official if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one was check out and more than half the time it was for me. The film is terrible now. Special effects are terrible. Acting is terrible, but I loved it. Actors are stupid, conspiracy, stupid, many - as if they were able to see through the monsters, "arachnids" looked like they were made of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was a light underground, TNT was not deafening, etc ... You really have to love B-movies so you can enjoy it ... alcohol helps others.
