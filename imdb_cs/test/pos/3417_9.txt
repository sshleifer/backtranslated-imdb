A member of the South African Parliament who does not remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist. South African lawyer Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank) is meanwhile returning home to represent Mpondo. Just like Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested with him, this film is one of the best films ever made in the Aparthied Republic of South Africa. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch.
