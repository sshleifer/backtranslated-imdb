This is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel Masuji Ibuse, "Black Rain". Just as the book is very mobile and provocative. The story revolves around paired attempts to see their niece successfully taken. They have difficulty finding suitors because of the rumors that they are suffering from radiation disease, following a Hiroshima walk on the day of bombing. Well filmed, easy to read, moving, tragic, scary and fun.
