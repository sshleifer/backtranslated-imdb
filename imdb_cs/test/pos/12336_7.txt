I didn't know anything about this movie before I watched it. It seems to be the lesser-known teen horror of the 1980s. What occurred to me was the way it differed from so many other films of that time. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was how slowly this movie builds. This does not mean that typical character display settings are murdered one by one. It takes time to build a back story, so a little secret about what might happen. I was almost beginning to think that no one would really be hurt in this movie. However, everything leads to a climatic sequence over the last 15 minutes, and then gets quite graphical (it was a bad time for a refreshment break - I almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started). <br /> <The characters also seem somewhat more three-dimensional than many cheap teenage frightened movies. The talks were mostly refreshing, as opposed to the worst stereotypes you would expect. For example, a girl who is popular, snobbish, queen-bee crank is not constantly gushing insults on everyone but is able to have doubts and show some consideration to others. So, To sum up, I felt that this film was somewhat original compared to what I was expecting, and a little better. It attracted me, I was wondering, and then he left me. As I said, it is quite harsh in the final, but for almost the rest of the time it is almost friendly to me. I don't have to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
