It's not hard to imagine what the main problem is for a writer who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with approximately the same screen time in a movie that takes about 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to return to stereotypes, and that's what writer-director Ralf Westhoff does here. Very few characters can be recognized as people you and I know in real life, many of which are characterized by two or three attributes and remain vague. I am aware of this, but I still think that the "Shoppen" is successful and that it only fulfills what it wants. It is a film with a very well-written dialogue, very good acting and a film that very often made me laugh. I don't think this film wants to do a deep analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a moral commentary on dating. It is a film about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Fun and fun.
