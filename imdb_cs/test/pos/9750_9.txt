it was a well-thought-out and well-shot and directed television film that took a huge object with great precision and intelligence, giving it a cinematic treatment that would look great on a larger screen - the palette is a bit dimmed for television. If you're looking for a war action movie or "bosnia lite", it's not for you - it's about an ordinary woman who has gone to a special challenge for humanity. If you want to know more about the conflict and how the work of one woman has massively affected the world, watch this movie when it happens. I do not see that many other TV films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids the apparent demonization of "bad guys" and instead denies denial and everyday hatred that resulted in thousands of deaths. I was moved to a few points and not in some manipulative Hollywood way with music management and flashy mise-en-scene, but allowed to discover horror and consequences along with the characters. it is a movie that is bold enough to let the content speak for itself, and keeps the visuals undervalued to support them with dignity. Actors are doing a great job of reviving intense dramatic scenes. the scenes where the victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is terrible - no one else has given him a chance to play the Brit, and when he finally has him, he is fired! - and although John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / commando, it's a bit too nice, though he does a good job.
