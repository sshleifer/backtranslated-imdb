This movie is a "silly comedy of the year" and maybe the best of Mike Judge from "Office Space". If you are a Mike Judge fan or you are enjoying a show like Futurama, then you are doing a serious disservation by skipping over this little-known, limited edition. Although DVD touts of very few "bonus features", this film is certainly pretty funny enough to generate it is perceived "lack of value". This film is about an army grunt named Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) who is part of a secret army experiment designed to rescue the army personnel in peacetime so that he can be annoyed at war time to he fought for our country. However, things will take an interesting turn when the general responsible for the operation is arrested in the circle of prostitution and the experiment is just forgotten. Bowers, and his sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves awake in 2505, where over the course of natural selection, the population of America became increasingly silly. Joe and Rita must now find their way to the machine for the time to return to 2005 with the help of Frit (played by Dax Shepard). What I really liked about this movie was Mike Judge's comedic satire on the history of American history over the past 50 years, and how mankind progresses over the next 500 years. This is most evidenced by the advertising in the film, which became the core of American culture. With programs such as South Park in the media, it is easy to see how conclusions can be drawn that in the future professions have become a marketing tool. This is shown in the film humorously with subtle things such as "Fudd-Ruckers" changing their name to "Butt-F ### ers", and a billboard that displays the ad "If You Don't Smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You Also, I can't stop laughing on the role of Carls Jr in this future, with their slogan "F ### you ... I eat" and their automated self-advertising kiosks of their "Extra Big-A ## Tacos". Multiple Molecules! This movie contained everything I go into movies. Excellent, sharp, funny comedy, as well as a riveting plot to make this DVD one for ages, but be warned.If you are not a Mike Judge fan, he didn't care about "Beavis and Butthead "or they don't have a sense of humor, then this movie is probably not a good match for you. Otherwise, I'd say it's probably the funniest movie that came out in 2506 ... I think 2006.
