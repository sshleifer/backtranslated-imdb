When I saw "La Pianiste" a few years ago, I thought I'd never see it again, so powerful and disturbing. Time went on, but I couldn't get the movie and his main character, Erik Kahut from my mind. A story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with an inner world so dark and disturbing with demons of fear, self-destruction and self-destruction that are strong enough to destroy it. more than one view. I read the book "Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, a controversial Nobel Prize winner in the literature on which the film is based and after reading the film I saw it again. The second time, all the pieces of the puzzle came to the right places. It is not so often that a brilliant book is transmitted to a screen of such brilliance as "Le Pianiste". Three actors performed excellent performances. Franz Schubert's piano music "soaked with morbid humanity" is another bright star of the film. I have only one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the movie where Haneke made some changes to the character of Erika in comparison to the novel. In the book that was farthest, she revealed to Walter, a young conservatory student who had attracted her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with, and showed her how much it reflected, she stopped communicating with him. Erik from the book would never replace Walter to suit him. She kept everything inside - she didn't want to behave, she wasn't a persecutor - she liked to watch. A great scene during a hockey match was not necessary. She tried to make Erika sympathetic (and, of course, Huppert was heartbreaking), but she took the secret that surrounded her - Jelinek didn't write the scene, it sounded and looked fake in an otherwise excellent movie.
