> This show is the only biggest thing that came out of America by The Simpsons. Not only does it have thousands of new ideas, but it is actually controversial (see Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not scared to "tick" people. However, the big brains at Fox have canceled it, along with Greg Bunny and Futurama, so make sure you buy the season 1 box when you can. It will be the best money you will ever spend. It's definitely a show that's getting better the more you watch it, because at the beginning it may happen that the constant flashes will be a bit annoying and don't always seem fine. However, after a few episodes, you realize how brilliant it is, and how well it compares to any other show that's currently in the air.
