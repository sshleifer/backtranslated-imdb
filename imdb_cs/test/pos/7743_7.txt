For many years, I thought I was the only person on the planet to see TEMPEST, and I'm glad I'm not the only one to discover this sleep somewhere in their movie travels. TEMPEST is loosely based on Shakespeare and follows an architect (late John Cassavettes, in one of his best performances), bored with his work and the crumbling marriage (to real husband Gene Rowlads) who decides to drop everything. We go to hell with a rat and live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald, in his film debut) and new girlfriend Aretha (luminous Susan Sarandon). Though Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavettes' hand is throughout this film ... long scenes shot without cutting, an improvisational sense of dialogue ..., a self-evident narrative style, it's definitely his show from the beginning, and if you're not a fan His work, the movie will seem laboriously long and boring, but if you are a fan, there are rewards to be. Cassavettes is surrounded by first-class cast ... his scenes with Rowlands cracking with intensity, and his startling chemistry with Sarandon is a sharp contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut and there's a scene that alienated Raul Julia as Kalibanos, Cassavettes' manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic and witty and intense. Yes, it is a bit long and incoherent and works a bit too hard to be different (there is even a curtain at the end of the movie, but it never catches the attention of those who have in their filming.
