This 1925 film tells the story of a rebellion aboard the Potemkin battleship in Odessa. The film celebrated the 20th anniversary of the rebellion of 1905, which was seen as a direct ancestor of the October 1917 Revolution. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their length and way they combine to emphasize his message, in addition utilizing various camera angles and revolutionary lighting techniques. The sequence "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby stroller, which loosened up the stairs after his mother was shot, was later re-created in the untouchable Brian d 'Palma. Obviously, the film is one of the best ever made in terms of its time and how innovative it is that you need a bit of patience and be a true movie enthusiast to pass 70 minutes.
