I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had iconic consequences, but I also saw a lot of director's later works, which, though they were beautifully bloody, were also quite inconsistent. DUCKLING MUST NEVER BE had a linear story and a mystery that kept me to the end. And after all it was said and done, it was a really disturbing and scary experience. One big objection: I'd rather hear the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.
