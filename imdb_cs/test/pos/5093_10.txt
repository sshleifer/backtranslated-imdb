Peter O'Toole gives a great performance in this movie. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the movie in general, even if it is a musical. I've never seen anything Mr. O'Toole had in what I don't like. He is a brilliant actor, many times talented, with passion and depth performances. Petula Clark also made a surprisingly good performance and was ideal for the game. It is a versatile pleasing film, full of tenderness and bitter fun. I'll always remember (in para-phrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets never giving his children, and she says, "Of course you have hundreds - all boys." Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this film and express your opinion.
