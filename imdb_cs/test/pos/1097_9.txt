Yes, maybe there are parts of this movie that require suspension of the faith a little bit, but it doesn't take anything from the movie's magic and miracle. It turned out to be part of our Youth Film Festival and was a popular organizing committee. Which is not surprising. Topic - Meeting in race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is very topical and the topic treatment is inspirational.
