I'm so glad that Zac was in 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody' because it's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. It's a really funny episode and a fun show !! I like everything about the show and the characters. All artists are great. Keep playing Zac and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including High School Musical) are on this show. Zac Efron is so "hot" and I have it signed! It's not a photocopy, and it came all the way from America to Australia and it almost didn't arrive in time for Christmas. I also got High School Musical Mug with my name printed on it. Scarlett 8
