Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on screen as a Masked Man in the epic adventure of director Lesley Selander "The Lonely Ranger and Lost City of Gold," co - starring Jay Silverheels as his loyal Indian Boy Scout Tonto. Selander was an old hand at the helming of westerns during his 40 years in movies and television with over 100 westerns to his directorial credit. This fast-paced opera included a revisionist perspective in his portrayal of Native Americans, which have been gradually gaining recognition since 1950 in Hollywood sheep after director Delmar Daves walked through the Western Broken Arrow trail of James Stewart. Racial intolerance is the primary theme of Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald's screenplay. After writing 13 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" TV series, Schaefer and Freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula, but they raised bets on this theatrical trip. Our vigilante heroes go to rescue the Indians who are murdered with white hooded hombres for no apparent reason. The secret about the identities of these murderers and the reason for their murder behavior is revealed quite soon, so you don't have to guess what's going on. Although violence in this saga saga looks tame to current standards, the fact that a lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill on one scene, rather than a blow, and that the horrible dame is killed by an accomplice of double crossing by hurling tomahawk, who sinks in his back between his shoulder blades, was brave enough. The TV series never went to this length, and when Lone Ranger controlled his six-gun weapon, he fired a gun from the bad guy before firing him. Another mismatch is here Indians lynch one of the raiders and tortured him for information, but they are never brought up on charges of kidnapping this follower. Douglas Kennedy did not have a villainous statue of Lyle Bettger who threatened Stuart Heisler's Masked Man, "The Lone Ranger," but behaves quite well as a cowardly crime that kills one of his own followers without being wrong. threatens to reveal their friends' name and identity to a group of vengeful Indians. "The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with a recap of a masked hero as an ambushed Texas. Ranger and his conversion to the Lone Ranger with Tonto, which served as his sidekick. This introductory two-minute refresher is a great way to get a serial-oriented character to the start, so everyone, including fans outside the Lone Ranger, is on the same level. The primary plot of a gang of unscrupulous white hoods and called no - surprisingly - hooded robbers begin with them killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. A lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to hit, but they will find a baby nearby. Taking a baby and a dead Indian, they drive to a nearby Spanish mission under the supervision of Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody "Outsider") and turn the baby and body to him. Initially, Padre must reassure the Indian girl, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby") that the masked person will not hurt them and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto away to the city to bring the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks "Gun Fever"), and Tonto immediately gets into trouble in the form of a paunchy city lawyer, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts "Giant") who abhors the Indians. Tonto tries to see a doctor who treats a prisoner in a sheriff's jail, and Matthison's men start roughly when Rolfe hits and goes back to the mission. Finally, Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the robbers' hoods, but Indian Redbird (Maurice Jar of "Drum Beat"), and his brave fellows kidnapped followers and took him back to his village. He pushes him out and shoots arrows at him to release his tongue. Major villain Ross Brady ("Hell's Crossroads" Douglas Kennedy) and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of Devil's Canyon) go out to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captive follower. Brady knows his follower was talking. The lone Ranger and Tonto come long afterwards and blame Redbird for his perfection. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died, and Lone Ranger decides to accept the disguise to learn more. He disguises himself as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and an artificial southern accent. Despite his brief 83-minute run time, "Lone Ranger and Lost City of Gold" lacks either excitement or surprise. Selander keeps the action in full swing. The dialogue is largely exposure rather than memorable because Schaefer and Freiwald move the story forward more often than spring surprise, but there is one big surprise that is related to a good Indian theme. There is also a scene where Lone Ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everyone under the law at a time when Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren has embarked on high milestones of decisive decisions that have recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation, \ t separation of church and state and police arrest in the United States. One thing that distinguishes the "Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashes of memories of the age of Spanish conquerors with a mild bit of science fiction that is involved in the form of a destructive meteor. Lone Ranger stories have generally been confined to the 19th century without going to European history. No, Lone Ranger was not the first movie to engage in Spanish conquerors. Robert D. Webb's "Seven Gold Cities" (1955) provided for a Spanish search southwest for the eponymous sites, but Selander's Western defeat Gordon Douglas's "Gold of the Seven Saints" (1961) to the screen.
