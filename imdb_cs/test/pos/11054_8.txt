It's an amazingly well-shot adaptation of Eugen O'Neill's play. Its main drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes a lot of the time as it is a movie that's that, which is a shame because it's a good piece of primitive moviemaking, made by the time the sound was featuring all kinds of technical issues and as a result most films were experimental whether it was their creator's intention. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as in her silent films, and her entrance is still classic. Her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which only increases her seductively eccentric personality. As her friend, Charles Bickford is reasonably masculine, - was apparently born rocky - and the perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish dialect is not at all bad, and he always seems to be a natural sea man, very similar to O'Neill in his independent, tense nature. As Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion seems to be really from a different time. He has such a face and a voice, - open, unmanaged, absolutely guilty - it has disappeared from the ground. Mary Dressler is also in O'Neill's Swing of Things. Her empty expression and intensity around her eyes speak loud when she plays her praise figure as a woman occasionally bordering on psychosis. Poetic license, maybe because it's not in the script, but we can forgive Miss Dressler girls; it is too good for it not to. The story ends with moving to another thing, different from the resolution that is not the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly finished at the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. In Anne Christie, we are in the land of O'Neill, in the sea, in storms and fog, in the sense of omnipresent and damned insecurity that we would now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author presents it simply and wisely because the weather, the land, the ocean, and the people are intertwined and addressed in a unique language that we believe we have heard.
