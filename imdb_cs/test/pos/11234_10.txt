Obviously, many of your nights were spent alone. If you watched 5 minutes of the real show instead of watching the ad, you would see one of the biggest TV shows in Canadian history. Too bad you'd watch it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... no game. The keys to the VIP are cheerful, light and funny. Guys will eat this show up. My game is tight and I can't wait to get to this show. Chickens were HOOOOOT and clubs kicked their ass. I'll watch every week. This makes me wonder why there are no more great shows. It is now clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American television quality.
