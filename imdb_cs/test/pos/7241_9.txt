Although it is not as good as murder is announced, which was not only wonderful, but almost surpassed the book, it is an excellent adaptation. And you know what it is, it's a huge improvement on Geraldine McEwan. Now I do not feel proud of bad oral adaptations Geraldine McEwan's adaptation, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but they destroyed either the bad script, the confusing final solution, or both. Geraldine McEwan has suffered a sharp pace and both of the above issues, and I would consider the second worst of the ITV adaptation, the worst being Sittaford Mystery, which, even on its own merits, was dull and confusing. This adaptation of Nemesis is a huge improvement, not only respecting the book, despite several freedoms, but largely correcting the problems that the ITV version had. Despite the fact that Lionel has added that it is a bit uncomfortable with how he was written, how he behaved, and one or two moments of slow stimulation, it is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It's beautifully filmed, with nice photos and period detail, and the music is always great. These performances are amazing this time and make the most of the generally well-executed script, with Joan Hickson's brilliant as always as Miss Marple, and solid from Liz Fraser, Helena Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is exceptional, though she is cool and moving like Clothilde. Overall, it is worth watching, better than the recent version in almost all departments. Bethany Cox
