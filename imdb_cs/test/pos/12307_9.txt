He saw this film at NFT in London where it was shown as part of the BFI John Huston season. I wasn't sure what to expect, and it did very little for the first few minutes of the movie. In fact, the rest of the film continued to give little! No real plot, no action, no tension, very little drama and, with the exception of a short stretch at the very end, no scenery. However, the lack of all these features resulted in a wonderful movie. I don't understand why, but I think his underrated nature made the film almost perfect. Acting, screenplay, and most importantly, casting, it was all in place and I don't remember going away from a movie theater that's so good, but I still can't understand why. I just know I'll get a DVD (that's one of those movies that, as I'm sure, on a small screen will be as good as a cinema experience, provided you find yourself somewhere quiet to see!) And I'll watch it soon. I'm also interested in what my family and friends think about it. I am sure it will not be the choice of all, but I am convinced that many people agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
