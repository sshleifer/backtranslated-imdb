If you're listening to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's going on with "Split", I found that watching the movie under the influence of LSD helped to cope with the audio / video tracks from the fantastic editing work. The story was important only from the other to the other. The acid helped communicate with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't bother to write about something out of your understanding ... These big independent attempts at expression at the most brutal, amateur level just aren't enough. I dare to make a film that would just as much confuse and change the way I look at the visual arts and the realities of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet explored this human mind. I love Chris Shaw's vision. I also appreciate E. Elias Merhige's texturistic terrorist film "The Begotten".
