For the first time I watched this movie on the Sci Fi channel and I must say it was just amazing. For those of you who love the "Never Ending Story", it's the one that will bring back the memories of the movie. Although it is a 1996 film, it has a hazy environment and a look that makes it a fantasy. The acting was brilliant and the music was great especially at the beginning of the battle song and at the end of the song. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, WATCH IT! I recommended completely!
