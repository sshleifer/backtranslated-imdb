After seeing Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on Saturday Morning Blog, as associated with YouTube, I used the same resources to watch a Technicolor remake for a Columbia cartoon unit and animate the same man-Ub Iwerks. Colors, compared to earlier black and white, are actually used imaginatively and many new gags, like one of the skeletal group's players stumbling on the wrong note, or when one loses his head and takes someone else when one is them. dances with others with part of the others gone - are just as funny as the previous shorts. At the end it repeats a little. However, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing all the animation enthusiasts who wish to compare it with the former Silly Symphony.
