I saw this amazingly filmed movie that captures the essence of NYC with a high outline or some big city of America in the middle of the century. Colors, cars <br /> <br />, clothing and the arrival of the women's movement. Reflects <br /> <br /> comf-cozy attitudes between men and women in the corporate world <br /> <br />. In some ways things have changed and in others they have not changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but now they have all kinds of laws and mandates to achieve equality. In my opinion, beautiful women will still be throwing at men in <br /> <br /> striving for their goals! The laws that we now have against persecution and <br /> <br /> all have been passed on by unattractive women who wanted the same chance <br /> <br /> to compete with the nicer women who could be given the positions of soley > <br /> based on their appearance and unloading! Real competition is not between men and women, but women and women! I liked the look and feel of the movie, but the world hasn't changed like <br /> <br /> as well as what's real
