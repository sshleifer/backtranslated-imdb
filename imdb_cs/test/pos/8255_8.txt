I recently bought this movie on a DVD at a $ 5 discount store. Although it is a DVD that is not recorded on the Geneon label (just a movie that starts playing instantly - no menu, no special features), image and audio quality was excellent. The film is based on the true story of one of the largest bank robberies in history. Richard Jordan, whom I must admit, has not heard of it, plays the lead role - Pinky Green. A charming young man who has spent too many years in prison and now wanted to go straight, but not allowed! Draws an American in England. David Niven plays a leading evil guy, also with great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with gaudy, like refusing to irritate Pinky's "blow" for this job. Whack, in England, is obviously a fair share of the goal and not a bullet in his head like in American gangster movies! All supporting casts do a great job that produces a very believable movie. For me it is perhaps best that the whole movie is quite entertaining and understandable (I often find myself lost in conspiracy confusion and various characters) without any special effects. No blood. No violence. Neither car chase! Just a well written story, well done, well directed and well photographed! If I had any complaints about the movie, I'd ask for music. What does bluegrass music do in a banking story that takes place in England?
