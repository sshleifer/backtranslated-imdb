I remember that years ago BBC1 showed this film in a very cut shape. I watched it on the video a few years ago and looked at it again. Although the film was slow and somewhat odd (mountain men look very strange), the atmosphere was extremely effective. It's one of my favorite movies and I have no idea where the full version is. He is currently deleted everywhere (except the US where he was accidentally listed on a horror compilation!). It's a pity that you can't get this movie the way you see it. Bad Turn (recently made by Stan Winston) owes Just Before Dawn. One of the better 80s slasher movies and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
