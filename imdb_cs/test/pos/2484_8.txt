I saw Peter Watkin Culloden and The War Game a few months before and was very impressed. This technique is basically the same, or at least very similar, in this film detailing, on the one hand, a trial with dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future and the second attempts by a group of convicted "criminals" to fall through over 50 kilometers of desert to gain their freedom in government-run "punishment park" as an alternative to jail. Watkins is filming everything in a documentary style, which causes more than a bit of clumsiness or the need for a strong suspension of distrust: how is the camera crew with a group of starving and arid prisoners within two days without offering them help or sharing in their misery? And that's just the most obvious example. But the controversial narrative aside, that packing blow; There is no doubt that you should be interested in making the film politically to get involved, but the film is not really like anything else in its era: it does not draw any strikes, it offers no simple solutions. Left-wing political figures are certainly occasionally painted, but they are not all the same; right-wing government officials seem to be a bit more cartoonish, but they can show at least some humanity. Overall, the film gives a lot of thinking and leaves an indelible taste ......
