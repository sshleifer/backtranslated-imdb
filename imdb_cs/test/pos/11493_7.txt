Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later, he is very depressed and leaves her and expects to "clear the fog" in their lives. Joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very much supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her at the border of Mexico. There, Joline meets confused Carl and realizes he can't change his mind while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and starts dating her, and at the end of 'life goes on'. This movie is very unpredictable, it has a very different story. I believe this is an independent production. In some parts it is a bit slow and boring, but there are some dialogues that this movie is worth. I liked it and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Rebeldes At√© o Fim '(' Rebels to the End ') <br /> <br />
