Certainly not only for lovers of urban legends, Campfire Tales is often a scary and always fun ride through several popular stories. It is also a film that has exceeded the (low) expectations I had. A horrible movie that I have never heard of or read about it, a direct video release (assuming that the other is often a pleasant surprise, but with horror movies today it can be all or nothing), casting mostly unknowns. Well, I'll leave you math. The film turns out to be a fun, exciting and overall very enjoyable experience. The four stories are well-paced and satisfying. The only thing that I felt was a little weaker, it was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it hardly provides any explanation for its actions or actions; however, I still loved the story, its atmosphere and the end. My favorite was the third story, "People can lick too" - the tension in it is not only palpable but also educational. I found Campfire stories that are one of those horrible gems that discover the chance, and then continue to make recommendations to everyone. <br/> 7/10
