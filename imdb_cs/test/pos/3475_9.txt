Inside Rory O'Shea Was Here is the story of two handicapped young men, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, who is weakened by Member States and also restricted to a wheelchair. The film is located in Ireland and opens with Rory, who arrives at the Assisted Living Center. He eventually befriends Michael but only after a few tense scenes where Rory rebels against staff and other patients in the usual "movie tour" play vocal metal music, using profanity and general obnoxness. His friendly friendship with Michael is confirmed by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael or is at least willing to try. Finally, through some process and tribulation of a couple of petitions, and the right to own housing in a specially designed apartment. The apartment is paid by Michael's father who basically left him because of his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them with their everyday life. This is basically where the core of the film unfolds, as it develops feelings for it. Michael is hit especially hard. Unfortunately, for both, but especially Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and it has to leave. As Michael retreats temporarily and wants to return to Asst. Living center, Rory convinces him to continue living alone. The film ends with a sad note that many viewers may have seen the coming, but in the end we feel that Michael is truly independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed out at the end of the film. You know, I can't say I've seen a lot of "handicapped movies" and I don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a type of formula for them. One person is not willing to live for his illness until some liberating force forces him to do it, and inside I dance is really different. What works, though, is that it is probably the most detailed about the peaks and valleys that two men are going through what one might expect. There are no deliberately unreasonable moments and no "getting up and encouraging" manipulation. Sad parts are sad and funny parts are funny. Some viewers might have a bit of a reflection that Rory is a pointy punk hair type with ears in her nose as a too perfect "rebel" clich√©, but actor James McAvoy justifies him in some way. The same can be said of Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it doesn't seem to be caused by a bad script that would try to get the audience to work, but rather a young man who was really in pain over unrequited love. Many types of pain may involve any physical condition. Again, these are the types of things that make the movie work and make it crazy without being crowded and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
