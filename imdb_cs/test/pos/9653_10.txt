This film is probably the best new French film I've ever seen in this century. There have been some great ones including Noah's irreversible, Green Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocencebut none of them bring Les Amants Reguliers' timeless glory. This film is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed it in the wake of it and further it is and updates, and homage, Nouvelle Vague-films of those days. Regarding the riots in Paris, the film is carefully accurate (I am only 19 years old and I was not alone there, but you know what I mean) and almost in real time and very long turbulent scenes perfectly fit into the streets of Paris. The riots are not celebrated or beautifully photographed as you do in Bertolucci's The Dreamers (to which the film is comparable in many ways), instead they are filmed in the filthy black-and-white shots of excellent William Lubtchanski. The love story, which is the main focus of the film after the riots in 68, is filmed in stunning and much less blurry images, and can trigger true feelings of love and teenage confusion in an otherwise politically disturbed and seemingly cold environment. This film is a beautiful love story and radiates through it that the director wants to portray his own experiences from those mythical late sixties that make the film more compelling. However, the film is also a tribute to the entire Nouvelle Vague canon. Much of the dialogue evokes early Truffaut, and length and non-action and plot less structure is reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godard's verfremdung effects with people looking directly at the camera and even directly addressing Bernard Bertolucci. This film is undoubtedly the answer to Bertolucci's The Dreamers song, and it is also a tribute to Nouvelle Vague, but still stands for itself as a beautiful and vibrant love story. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: This movie is incredible If you like French cinema, you shouldn't sleep on it. This may be the best French movie from Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.
