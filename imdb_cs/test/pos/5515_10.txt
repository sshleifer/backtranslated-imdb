Lots of people give this movie a lot of crap and everything is really undeserved. People give this film a hard time either because it is such a sick subject, or that the harp of any technical aspect of the film is not being watched by anyone watching it. If you just look at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable ... DO NOT LOOK! However, you should be missing out on one of the better film experiences of the late 1990s, despite what anyone else says. Dee Snider is amazing as Captain Howdy, a fool of madness he undresses. To play this character must be out of words, and it is much farther than any of us would have to be willing to go. Acting is amazing. The film itself shot beautifully. The theme can be too much for many people who have to swallow, but it's still well worth your time. If you haven't seen this movie, check it out.
