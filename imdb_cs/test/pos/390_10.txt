Cam Archer's Lyon Bobbycrush boldly captures a disorienting kaleidoscope that is the desire of adolescents to have a vivid visualization (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibration than narrative. Bobbycrush, somewhere between documentary and dream, recalls the ingenuity of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Santa. With roughness, grace and grief, it's a bit like the film equivalent of Sonic Youth playing chewing gum.
