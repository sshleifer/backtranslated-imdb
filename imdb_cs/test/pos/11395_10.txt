Last week I rented Boogie Nights and I could tell you when I watched the movie I had. If you think you're looking at a movie, it will hurt you. I mean yes, if your not a porn person who can't bother it, it's before it is a movie to see. But the thing is, the whole movie is not about porn. About half of the film is about the porn industry, but the other half is about the evolution of characters and the bad situations that these characters go through. The actors played the perfect role here, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. Sex scenes, of course, are amazing, but they mainly focus on the figure of hype in porn movies as long as he fights there. Great movie, one of the best! Hedeen's View: 10/10 **** A +
