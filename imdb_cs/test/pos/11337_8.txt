"In the mood for love" teasing the allegory of loneliness and desire. Here's a movie without sex or even kissing - and this is undoubtedly one of the most seductive and definitely the most provocative and psychological novels I've ever seen. Telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are apart. The film, as opposed to "Random Hearts", is about how two people meet through the affairs of their two lovers. Only after receiving this message, do they have time to think about the consequences of the affair and the mutual feelings of having just broken up - and whether the two people are willing to return to love. What is amazing about the film is how Wong Kar-Wai presents the way each character works with loneliness. With Maggie Cheung, she shows her in repeated editing: she leaves her job, goes home, watches her neighbors gambling, head to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop and hit her attractive age level played by Tony. Leung. This is a clever, if not subtle, conscious technique that represents loneliness. This is when you are alone when you are in a loop. This film worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
