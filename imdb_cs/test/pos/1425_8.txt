This movie was never intended as a big-budget movie, but it was a cute little picture that almost everyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it's definitely charming and engaging. Clifton Webb plays a mantis (that's definitely not new), which has a TV. However, his evaluation is failing and he is afraid of cancellation. So he decided he was too out of touch with the children - because he and his wife had no own. Volunteer as a volunteer and sorry to do it almost instantly! Remember, he's a damn boy and he doesn't like kids. To make it worse, one of the kids likes him and follows him as a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he acts to the child, the child wants to spend time with him! The boy is cute and almost steals the show itself! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the rotation and filming of the movie are something you'll have to find out for yourself. Understand that this is a light, cute, but not cloning movie you'll probably enjoy.
