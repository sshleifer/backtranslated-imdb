eXistenZ combines director David Cronenberg's traditional love with blood and gore and exploding heads with more confusing aspects of David Lynch's realistic twist. And indeed it works effectively. I'm not going to bother trying to give bare bones to the synopsis because it only causes more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about a virtual reality computer game that's so incredibly vivid that it's hard to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. It seems that the film almost leaves its fear of technological fear at the end, but then throws the last twist in the final round of the dialogue. There is also a very crude sexual image based on 'bio -ports' in the back of the protagonists, as well as some very crude acts from Jude Law. He can leave as naive and stupid and boring and any other unpleasant habit you can think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh comes much better, and everyone else can be called a support character, including Will Dafoe in a functional, if not remarkable, role as a money-crazed mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective science fiction film about the possibilities that technology can represent and the possible consequences it will have.
