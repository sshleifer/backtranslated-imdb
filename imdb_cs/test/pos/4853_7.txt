A well-functioning drama based on Arthur Miller's novel. Something as simple as glasses changes life. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a man who has decided to be content with his secular life; same job twenty years and still lives with his mother. The boss tells him to fix his vision with a pair of glasses. Newman's life changes drastically and immerses him in hell. The glasses he chose make him look Jewish. He is losing his job and becoming the subject of a difficult exploration of his Brooklyn neighborhood. She seeks work, meets the attractive and open Gertrude (Laura Dern) who lives in conflict because of her Jewish appearance. Soon, the new life of the couple becomes a nightmare filled with humiliation and attacks on fanatics. A very apt cast that features: Joseph Ziegler, Peter Oldring, Kay Hawtrey and Musical Glory, Meat Loaf.
