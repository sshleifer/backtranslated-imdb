Today I was not a Madonna fan, but I think I would like to comment on this film. This movie is wrong. One of them, like Madonna, criticized the critics. They were very wrong and many potential viewers were turned off by bad reviews. First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie, which was one of her first. In the movie plays ditsy blonde, far from ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat concerned with her singing fame and did not give her a fair shake. When you see this film, I hope you understand that the accent and goofy just work. She was absolutely hysterical, as was the film. Griffen Dunne is another person who didn't get a fair view in the movie. If you look at his filmography, you'll see he's a pretty perfect actor. As for the film itself, it's like a pretty woman, but it came 3 years before Roberts. Success. It's a comedy that has a lot of gag pages, slapstick and one inset. Some comedy is a dead end and takes a comedy fan to really appreciate the softer humor. I know it's not going to say much about the movie, but I hope it will help dispel any belief that this is a bad movie. It is perfectly advisable to rent a nice night of great fun. Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
