This is the latest Ghibli movie and is also the most convenient move away from an established studio style. First of all, this film was clearly aimed at small children, which is much more than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of other movies and features a brand new far less realistic animation style? and yet it's so fun. Although there is nothing to attract adults, I still find myself on the screen and was immersed in the story. The secret of the film is brutal honesty with regard to conspiracy and characters. The story and characters are very first with their feelings / intentions etc., But it makes them all the more cute. Special attention was also paid to the soundtrack, which is absolutely amazing, although it is different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. It seems to me that I've been singing a cute song all along, just like anyone who sees this movie!
