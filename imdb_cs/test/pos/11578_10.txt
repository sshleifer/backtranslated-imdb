Today I saw 'The Sea Inside' and I loved it. The film's actors are amazing (of course Javier Bardem), but I thought Belén Rueda would have a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segur and, in particular, Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I can't forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). There are two technical aspects that I have loved very much: Aguirresarobe's photos and Amberbare's own score. I liked the song "Negra sombra" ("Dark Shadow") written by Luz Casal with the music of Carlos Núñez. Compete in the Oscar Awards. I also liked other Spanish productions, such as Almodóvar's "Bad Education", but Amenábar's film is much better than them. "The Sea Inside" deserves all the awards.
