The kid is a really good family movie about the stuffy video consultant Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much social life as he does, because he's not always pretty. However, one day things change when the eight-year version magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to fix things. Bruce Willis plays the lead role and gives a really good performance. Kid is a nice, warmly warm movie for everyone.
