Hitchcock once provided an interview where he said he liked to direct the scenarios that had an ordinary person who was guarding his own business, which was mistakenly caught up in a terrible chain of events that couldn't get out until their troubles had a terrifying plot. resolved. Viewers can feel more sympathy for the hero. We will definitely do it in this fine film. Barry Kane is just trying to help his neighbor by doing acts of kindness and thoughtfulness, like helping Fry take the letters he dropped at the factory. Barry even returns the lost $ 100 bill to Fry later ... that was big money in 1943 !! It's Barry's act of Christian kindness that gets him into trouble and is soon ill-accused of sabotage and murder and is likely to hang if he can't clean himself up. Like The 39 Steps in Fence, the hero travels across the country to discover plans for further fascistist cell terror, an arc that no one could believe was a Nazi wardrobe, and a beautiful blonde Patricia Martin. who first suspects and hates then finally falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's trademarks of humor are also here. Patricia's billboard model, which is a variety of road ads are help and convenience for Barry as she holds on to riding with bad guys, all the way from Las Vegas to New York. We meet a truck that is a one-piece comedy act "Someone convinced my wife that it's stylish to eat three meals a day." Employees in the field of the fascist spy ring worry about "suits" being forgotten or ignored, as if they were working for a legitimate business. During the movie chase scene, viewers laugh at the action comedy / gangster movie, with a sabotage cell filming with real boys and killing a tortured film patron at random. Terrible for a dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous landmarks in his movies and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as a background and ironic icon! It works even better than Mt Rushmore's NBNW scene.
