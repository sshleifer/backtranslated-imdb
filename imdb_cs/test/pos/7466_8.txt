This evening I had the privilege to see a screening of "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Going to film, I knew very little about it, and I just made a chance for it because the plot of the movie sounded interesting. So when I entered the theater a few hours ago, I was wondering what the final verdict should be with a thumb up or a thumb down. <br /> <br /> "These Girls" is the story of three of the best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is a leader who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father still makes her go to college, which is something she doesn't want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will be leaving for Christian school after the summer. Finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh), who plans to spend summer babysitting. But this summer will be strange, because they all blackmail Keith Clark (David Boreanaz) a sexy older guy, for whom they are children. Fun times and lots of laughter? I usually don't like movies like "These Girls", but I like something about this movie. I think the quality that I liked the most about was the fact that it looked more realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a greedy guy who has sex with them to blackmail them later. It's a pretty funny story about adolescence, friendship and sex, but even though it sounds nice, I see most of this movie in real life. The subject here is probably the main reason the film didn't get a mainstream release in the United States. All girls in this movie are supposed to be under the age of 18. If I recall, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the US, even if underage sex occurs daily, many manufacturing or finance companies won't fund the film as this sexual content . This information was actually confirmed by director John Hazlett in Q&A after the film. The thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this movie aren't graphic and nudity is smaller. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are over 18 in real life. Go picture. <br /> <br /> What the film does best is that it gives a lot of laughter and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie, and each character had a "now and then" characteristic for them. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or up. Everything seemed to flow both comedy and drama. The script was very strong. Acting was largely very good. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "Wonderfalls", was simply amazing; just like Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who both did a good job. David Boreanaz did a good job and seemed to enjoy doing most of the scenes. The guy played pot pots, so it was funny to see him play this role. I was delighted to meet John Hazlett tonight, who looked like a very nice boy, and very much appreciated the comments about the movie. I'm shocked that this movie hasn't gone anywhere. I think with a little marketing behind him it might take off. Sadly, this will be one of these movies right on the DVD, which so little will always be a pleasure to see. I think with what little budget Mr. Hazlett had to work, the film went well and I think he did a great job of driving this little gem. For someone who usually hates teen sex comedy sincerely say that I really enjoyed this movie. The evolution of the characters and the funny script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and have fun. This is a subtle comedy because it has heart and courage. I know I will surely buy this movie when it comes to DVD on May 16, 2006. If you are a fan of age stories, teen sex sex comedies or romantic comedies, be sure to check this movie because it's one of them. the funniest movies of its kind that will be released in the years. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final rating for "These Girls" is 8/10.
