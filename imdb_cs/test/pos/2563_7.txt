The trailer for this film has so much focused on the string (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the film, which is about the emerging, though somewhat simple, relationship between Lazarus and Rae when they try to recover from the film. their past pains among themselves. Of course, with the assumption of nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there is a lot of implied sex. However, in its core, the Black Snake Moan is the basic story of redemption and healing power to help another person together. Maybe it's just me, but I think poor Lazarus should have had his story focused on more. He's a wounded man after his wife leaves him, but we never really see how Rae heals him to solve her past pains. It's just a hint that it does - basically plays a guide that helps young Rae overcome her curse, through a big ol 'string and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a little more and didn't have to rely on sensational. The side figures were quite decent, though simple and I liked the music. Behavior was good enough, though I can't be sure that the character of Rae is completely believable. But it can only be my naivety. All in all, I liked the movie, but I wasn't forced. It may be that I am too critical, but the story seems too comfortable to be fully believable, and so, even though it all looked very cool, it could never really be bought. The chain thing was a little too attractive to me. Still, it can provide some fun for those looking for a dramatic redemption of stories with a blues shot. 7/10
