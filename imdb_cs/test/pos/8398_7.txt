I watch this movie without much expectation, I think everyone should do. It's a great TV series and of course we couldn't compare it with Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also strange to see another Scarlett. Joanne Whalley doesn't play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I believe Scarlett has changed when she got old. Don't expect to look at it, but don't look at it: I think it would be terrible.
