I couldn't believe the adult Swim guys came up with this character. I just laughed all day thinking about this show. After I saw the pilot, I think I'll stick to the next few episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters is around, but Assy is hard to understand and it was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the character's title is literally a walking ass with nothing but legs that sports socks with suspenders and legs with traditional wings tips. Assy is drinking too much and "playing according to his own rules" as you may have guessed. The only other funny moments are Assy to shoot many, many people and spend time at home - in the bathroom. It's not funny Squidbillies, but it's worth a look.
