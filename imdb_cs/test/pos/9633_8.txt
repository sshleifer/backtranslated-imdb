Basically, it's a very good movie. This is very different from Seagal's other movies though, which unfortunately can turn off some of its fans. Unlike some other films, it doesn't feel like "Seagal's car". You also see a lot of other characters, and all Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we saw earlier. The concept of being an "intellectual" in something other than bombs and other weapons is a nice change. Although there are some unrealistic parts to the movie (some more obvious than others), generally you can let them slide because the movie is fun to watch. It boils down to this: if you're looking for the classic action movie Seagal, sorry, but you'll be disappointed. Watch it the same for fun. If you're open to see Seagal without action, it's worth a look. Personally, I think it is one of the best work he has done in a while. <br /> <br />
