The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most beautiful musical film ALL TIME. 1973 Musical Remake of James Hilton's Novel About Mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. Weird mix of direct drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the honor of being the ONLY anti-war musical fantasy he has ever made. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but it made a lot of money abroad. Only in America did it fail. Highly different and unique in its approach as a film musical deserves much better recognition than it is given. As the story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and this 1973 musical are the faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. On the 1973 version I like the freedom in which music numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and talented director and cameraman. This is BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a wonderful place. Songs like WORLD are CIRCLE, SHARE JOY and LIVE ONLY, DIFFERENT COMPANIES evoke the happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a little goofy? These two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and deleted I COME TO YOU are sensitive places in the picture. In both of these songs there is a calm and soft quality that is consistent with the philosophy of the story. What's more, MISS is a good duet with a strong melody. Is it a nice exchange of different types of perspectives and who can cause Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman to stamp, sing and dance on tables? They are a great team and their number is fine. In this story, I have always considered it interesting how High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to get to a place in Shangri-La. The character of High Lama is a subtle soul, but rather radical in its view of humanity as a whole. He has no hope for a world beyond Shangri-La. If this film was reworked today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the lead character, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left in the outside world, unlike what he found in Shangri-La. Of course, to make the film believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented at the end as suffering from amnesia, as it was in the book. The film version of LOST HORIZON was not true to the novel in this regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or imagine it? Everybody died in a plane crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La will be. The conflict with Conway, who wants to believe in Shangri-La and return to his old life in the outside world, is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but his brother is under pressure. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in exploring James Hilton's ideas on a hidden valley where money has no value and the rule is the rule. So in a sense it is anti-capitalism in its subject, where money and materialism are not motivation. The rule is human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette, and harmonious coexistence. LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He tries to answer basic basic questions of life and hardly fails for failing. It should be noted that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was a post CABARET. It no longer was fashionable for the characters to break out in the song in the musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. Lost HORIZON was an easy target for tired critics. The expectations were high, almost inadequate. Two targets were hit, producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, and critics did not reach both. Ross Hunter has enjoyed decades of financial success as producer and LOST HORIZON has been his follow-up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was the Universals Largest Wallet until then, and the success of this painting launched a decade of disaster films. For years, AIRPORT was the most watched movie ever featured on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At that time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful composers in the country. LOST HORIZON's Immaculate Sentiment barely had a chance as a result of a censorship breakdown in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Viewers played movies with content they didn't see on the screen. Sudden musicals were no longer well received, no matter how well they were made. Today, LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It is the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, beautiful music, expensive budget and some weird humor. It is unconventional in the sense that music is not introduced into the film within 45 minutes. It changes course in the middle of mystical valley and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves to be rediscovered. Lost and legendary treasure deserves much better than its reputation.
