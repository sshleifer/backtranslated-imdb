Have you ever noticed that you are watching a movie or a documentary and you have to stay back from screaming things like "No! Don't!"? No? It's time. And DEEP WATER is no doubt the one that will help you get started. The story is based on Donald Crowhurst's story and his entry into the world's first yacht race in 1968 to be individual. This word "individuals" is important because the men who embarked on this almost suicidal escapade set out on their own. Most men are well known in English communities in marine areas (where it is an "unknown dark horse" and its name is Donald Crowhurst. With financial problems, Crowhurst resorts to a proponent who can take it from him) everything if he could not at least go through a large part of the race he could have taken his home, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ... well ... deep water: either Trying to race with an untested ship and an untested captain, or you will lose everything you own (which was significant because Crowhurst had a wife and a few children) Notice the word "unconfirmed captain." Not only was he never in the open sea Deep Water between the pre- and post-race archival footage and those friends, family, and well-known Crowhurst, Deep Water is masterfully built, and the film was initially perceived as a poor sap, which She went over her head and gradually shows you the limited possibilities Crowhurst had on the water in months and months. His ship escapes. Interruption of equipment. The psyche reached out to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst found himself lost in the internal struggle without a successful way out. It is also interesting to see the psychological breaks that other competitors have when dealing with their loner aboard their ships. The wave emotions you will feel while watching this overwhelming document can cause you a little trouble (not unlike trying to get your feet on the sea). And you'll probably be frustrated with what's going on; maybe just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. The end is so amazing that we see the real ship Crowhurst sailed, sat abandoned and rotting on the Caribbean beach ... unlike other things that felt abandoned and rotting to the end of this badly a thoughtful race. Unbelievable.
