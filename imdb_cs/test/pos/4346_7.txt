Most critics seem to have rejected this film, like many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as another mosaic of mindless violence. And while there is a fair enough amount of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not such a terrible effort, especially for the fans of the series and its star. Police chief desperately trying to clean up the rough part of New York. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of the gang area, where it once again becomes an army of one man in the city war of good and evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. I'm not saying DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed, there is a plethora of drawbacks to the discriminatory eye. Characters are usually made of cardboard. Violence is on top. The man overtook and threw dozens of young punks into his sixties. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a certain charm that will please the crowd. Who doesn't want to see gangbangs to belong to them? There are also some great kitschy moments and single-liners so common in the 1980s movies. When a tenant of his apartment building sees Kersey preparing for example a shepherd, vigilance is said to enthusiastically claim to be "thinning the flock." The line, just Bronson, can actually work. So you see that the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept what it is. It's not Spielberg and it's not art. So throw popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
