Shame, is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband named Jan and Eve. They live on an island that works as a farmer. War is in progress and soldiers are starting to attack the people on the island. As soon as the war ceases, Jan and Eve are arrested when they go along with the opposite party. After even more problems follow and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death. Winner of the CEC Best Foreign Film Award at The Circus Awards Circular Awards, Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Eve's Liv Ullman) at The Guldbagge Awards, NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at National Council Review and NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Film at the National Film Critics Society Awards. Shame, good direction, good script, good performance by both Max Von Sydow (who plays John), Liv Ullman (who plays Eve), good cinematography and good production design. Too bad they acted well and did a good story about how people in desperate situations sometimes do everything they can to survive. The film has a powerful message and it's a good movie. The reason I didn't rate this movie is because it's not a masterpiece, like other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries, Seventh Seal or Persona. The film did not impact me as much as I thought it would be, and lacked a thoughtful and philosophical dialogue by Ingmar Bergman. While nowhere close to his best films, there is still a lot to like about Shame, and it's a good movie. I would probably like to see some of Bergman's other masterpieces.
