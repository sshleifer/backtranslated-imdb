I usually don't like this kind of movie, but I worked at home and wanted to watch something halfway when I did it. I got so submerged that I gave up work to sit and finish the observation for the last half hour uninterrupted. And I certainly don't miss tears over such a show, but at the end I cried. A lot of emotional nuances. Great acting performance and good feeling in the south. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors, and the one who played Luka was also good. Highly recommended.
