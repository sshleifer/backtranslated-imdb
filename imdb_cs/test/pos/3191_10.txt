I can't believe it ... after all these years it was finally watching ... that was supposed to be named 'The Great Pretender' in the production phase. I lived in Oz in time and took care of one of the places in the house through a friend after filming. It was me who showed these guys how to speak Scottish, and after that I realized that Russell Crowe was once !!! It took me years to watch it, I wasn't even sure if it ever went to the screen when I left Oz the next month after unpacking the page. At that time, Russell Crowe was not a required actor who is now, and I didn't know it was him until I saw the previous commentary, then I thought he'd be back in the days of filming ..... amazing ... Really pleased with himself! !!
