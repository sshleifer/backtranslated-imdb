In fact, however, Black Snake Moan was a great movie that takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus, whose wife throws him out for his brother and finds that Rae is abandoned and beaten on the side of the road. Lazarus discovers that Rae is sex dependent and has been abused as a child, so he decided to take things into his own by joining Rae with the chain to cure her of anger. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry and their performance will convince you that through their struggles and salvation, Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also impressed with Sam's ability to play electric guitar and be able to sing. Epatha Merrkensen is great because Lazarus' love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's friend Ronnie, who is little used in the movie but does the best he can to achieve great performance.
