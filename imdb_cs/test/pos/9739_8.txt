The idea of ​​pioneer comic book Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon" was a great dad of all sci-fi epics. This series is the first time Flash has been introduced to celluloid life. Despite the low budget, this is a big space opera. The story begins with Earth condemned to manifest destruction when Planet Mongo comes into space on a collision course. Scientist Maverick Dr. Zarkov embarks on an approaching planet in a self-made rocket ship, convinced he can do something to stop a fugitive heavenly body. He gets several last minute recruits in the form of the inventive Flash Gordon sportsman and beautiful Dale Arden. When they arrive in Monga, their problems really start. They run with the resistance of Emperor Ming, the ruthless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for Earth. the different foreign cultures he encounters; creates allies; space ships that fly; The battle that fights, and the monsters that kill. Brilliantly conceived by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classic archetypes from legendary myths and antiques. Echos of famous stories such as Troy and Camelot saga and Sherwood Forrest are seen here. You have a lively, handsome hero on the road to saving the kingdom (Flash); Evil King (Ming); Old Wise Man (Zarkov); Beautiful Miss in Need (Dale); seductive siren (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and assorted beasties. Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helena from Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are merry or knights of the round table. <br /> <br /> You have an idea. You can't help if you notice how many ideas from "Lightning Gordon" would later appear in Star Wars. City Cloud; Ice World; Forest Moon; Opening scrolling text (From the second series); There are others, but you get. This whole sci-fi genre owes this timeless classic to great debt. Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and I personally think he is better off in this kind of role than any of the current events. stars. He also starred Buck Rogers and Tarzan. Charles Middleton is the embodiment of devil's ugliness as Ming. Sure, it seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what viewers expected from their bad guys in the 1930s. Jean Rogers is our hero's in love with Dale Arden and I was so in love with her when I first saw it as a boy. I can easily understand why Flash has always run to its rescue. She is a quintessential good girl to avoid the seductive manipulations of Aura, a quintessential bad girl. The support cast seemed to be perfectly chosen to mimic their comic counterparts, and despite the now silly looking FXs there, there was a lot of exciting action in this pioneering series. The Almighty Entertainment and the Beginning of the Sci-Fi Genre at the Cinema.
