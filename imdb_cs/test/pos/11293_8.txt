Don't look at this movie when, or soon after eating. He said Begotten would stay with you for the rest of your life, like it or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing but a man who cries above the ground (paraphrasing the sequence of titles / introduction), it will be more than likely to contain the most intense and sharp images you will ever see in the film. There is no dialogue, only the image behind the picture describing the cycle of life. Combining a sharp black-and-white photograph with some truly scary background sounds, he tries to control the creator's home message. The film begins with God (pictured as a bandaged and apparently mad man) who sliced ​​his razor torso and then dies in his own dirt. After his death, Mother Nature emerges from her corpse to impregnate herself with her blood and seed and to give birth to a man who is represented by a worm on the earth. The landscape is a barren waste, inhabited by massive veiled humanoids who eventually become Mother Nature and Man. After killing violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and the destruction of man, these humanoids continue to pound the remains of corpses back into the earth and the cycle of life begins again. Actually, I rented this one from Blockbuster one night, based on the art envelope and content hype, but it's definitely not a blockbuster movie type. Don't expect a story, dialogue, or any moves. These are intense images based on a dark object. I'm giving this movie some high marks for filmmaking and sound, but I don't think I'll watch it too often if again. I like my films dark and unique, but this is more exponentially than I expected.
