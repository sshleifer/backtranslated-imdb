This depiction of abandoned Japanese forces in the Philipines is the way de force in utter absurdity of the war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after World War II. In the film, Japanese troops were left to look after themselves in the jungles of the Philipines. Facing the impending starvation, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose what has left mankind. To call this film depressing would be something that is underestimated. The viewer is left with a completely desperate sense of losing the value of life in a modern struggle. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is an unqualified statement. Highly recommended.
