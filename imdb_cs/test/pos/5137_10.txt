HOOT is about these three teenagers trying to save a lot of scrabble owls. now they think for me that the right is what is right and what is wrong. In this film the baby name Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and as soon as he gets on the bus, Dana Matherson starts bullying him the next day, starting to bully him and run off the bus and chase a mysterious running boy. after all that Roy finally meets a running boyfriend called Mullet Fingers (Cody linley), actually his nickname that his half-sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave him because he can grab Mullets with his bare hands. Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and join Beatrice to stop building a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one who is behind the vandalism that took place there, and later takes a little care of one of the dogs that is building there. so they stood by the bulldozer-driven muggle, and they all saw owls that turned out to be a great movie because they showed where children in life can change their lives by taking what's right and wrong. that's what's great on this movie. teaches a lot about wildlife and how important it is.
