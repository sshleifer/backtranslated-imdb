I chose "The English Patient" to allocate credits for history. I thought this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, she became one of my favorites. It accurately depicts life in World War II and the love story is amazing. The love story made the film so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, passion or something. That made me watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. They look beautiful together and actually seem to be in love. I recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a film that looks at leisure activities or a task.
