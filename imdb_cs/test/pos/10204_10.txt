Lang does Hawks just like Hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary Western before settling into typical deterministic, dark and guilty-haunted Lang for the finals. This is one of those films that show its size almost instantly, but at the same time very gently. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is riding and being watched, we don't know why - he comes across an injured Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but when he finds Creighton the wrong way, he decides to fix it first . This is mainly expressed by facial expressions and very short, cropped dialogue - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good person. Finally, Shaw will help Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappear. A few weeks or more later, with Creighton on repair and on an expedition to put a telegraph wire west of Omaha. . He hires Shaw as a scout trying to leave when he finds himself in charge of Creighton; but Creighton wants it anyway, paying off the debt and feeling something good. He is also hired by the gentle son of the project's patron, but atypically, East European Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent, as shown in the fun but exciting bronco-busting sequence. They both hire Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who, again not typically, seems to be able to take care of herself as a man. The first third of the film is dominated by camaraderie between the three men, comedic elements that include reluctant cooks and various kinds of harsh and drum, and beautifully played light romantic elements that remind me of Howard Hawks "Red River" or "Only Only". Angels have wings "than most Lang - but they are so good to play and action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter and does not change our enjoyment - if it changes our expectations - as the more usual Langian themes haunted past, dark secrets and immense campaigns easier the more destructive and evil paths control the later part of the film, Shaw's old friends are returning to haunt him as the train wagon and his wires move west, and the attacks attack the crew, and Shaw has to fight what, if anything, tells Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slad (Barton MacLane), the outlaw leader. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot early by Technicolor and moving quite smoothly from the sound stage to the West, that's Lang's best Western and one of my money. His best films, transport as tragically as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their m Scott is as good as I saw him, and I showed more with eyes than many actors in the dialogue paragraph, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The inevitable revelation between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and surprising for Lang's longtime devotee like me; and even in 1941 it seemed that there was no place at the edge of civilization that was more filled with meaning than hairdressing and dusty streets outside. You can shave, you can feel like a new person, but you can never be as long as the old ties still hold you. <br /> <br /> Genius.
