Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle didn't want to be called 'Fatty', but I couldn't resist the joke. This is a great Lloyd Hamilton short since his high season, directed by Roscoe. These two work together with a lot of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the picture in an interesting way. Most comics preferred flat lighting and a static camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses several long tracking shots and some pretty camera scams to tell his story and show Ham as a great actor as well as a talented comedian. This story plays with some interesting topics such as Lloyd's classic MOVE ALONG: this is about the perception of reality and the confusion that makes them. Or you may decide to ignore these questions and laugh at your head.
