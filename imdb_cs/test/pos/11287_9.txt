E. Elias Merhige's Begotten is a kind of its kind, a surreal depiction of human treatment of religion. There are several different ways you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: God falls apart and the earth's mother rises from her corpse. Mother Earth then devoures the corpse of the god after death and then impregnates with what is left of his seed. After this, she gives birth to a messiah figure who trembles, probably in childhood, but possibly with horror at being brought to life on earth. All this takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and after that, the rest of the film consists of a dress of a dragging messiah (who is constantly trembling or catching) across the desert landscape. Dressed characters are silent just to thwart the messiah, then drag it around. There are several ways to interpret this, depending on the level of optimism and your view of the world. It can be easily interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of obvious power that Christian "deities" can be perceived as having in modern society that only invokes their names to cede its own selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory in which you see the film as how mankind has twisted Christ's message so much that its original purity and innocence can no longer be important in a world where this message and image is inappropriately exploited everything, from interpersonal violence, to war, to totalitarianism. The pictures of this film are phenomenal and you will not see anything like that, period. If you can, check out the original VHS edition, I recommend. I'm not sure if the DVDs have changed the visuals, but I've seen clips of this streaming on you and the effects are severely reduced. In VHS, Merhige reached TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. That is, there are basically no midtones except some grain in some shots. In addition, this film offers a rare opportunity to see PURE White and PURE Black, and the result is stunning, hallucinatory, and quite disturbing. This film makes Noir looking positive and average. The shots are gradually intertwined in a surrealistic way that remembers Un Chien Andala, without neglecting it, the effect called the Rorschach Film Test. <br /> <br /> As has been said, the film can certainly test the patience and commitment of the viewer. There is no beginning dialog. The only sound in the whole movie is the fairly constant loop of cricket crickets, occasionally chipped with hoarse and deadly rattles of dying deities and the texture of a synthetic synthesizer. Personally, I find the film best suited to listening to experimental industrial music, such as instrumental NIN remixes from Downward Spiral era, more abstract noise / experimental music like F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically every music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, it's PRIME for postmodern re-contextualization, such as screening during the introduction of avant-garde music, or composing avant-garde music. As soon as the messiah is born, nothing really changes in the rest of the movie, meaning that you are basically sitting for at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah who is the drug around the desert and beaten. It looks bleakly beautiful, but basically nothing new. It helps shape filmmakers' intentions of communicating that people have been using Christ's name and image for personal benefits for thousands of years, but they can be tedious for an occasional viewer or someone with a short period of time. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique film experience and are not particularly popular in mainstream Hollywood cinema, it could be your trembling messiah.
