My favorite story from the crypt stories. Brion Jones was born to play a part of a maniac lumberjack, an ax swinging by Steve Dixon. When I first saw him in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never received the proper credit he deserved. A jealous husband marries an insult in his wife who shows interest in a young worker who is only employed. And you know when Dixon finds out hell will pay! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) gets the beatings from Dixon who has left him from the Almighty. blind.Now how does a blind lumberjack work? A Tribute to Black Humor If There Was One! What the stars do quite a good job too to support Ted when Dixon when he has his initial suspicion of his wife longing for another man. Though Ted should have done a wise thing and left when he could!
