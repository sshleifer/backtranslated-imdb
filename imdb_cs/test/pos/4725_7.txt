Patricia Arquette plays American physician Laura Bowman, who takes a vacation to Burma to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son. She is left in Rangoon during a military intervention and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a "guide". But it's not a simple guide; he is a professor who will introduce her to life outside the tourist traps ... both are trapped in a political coup and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people. This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describing some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Secondly, it's about women's struggle to find the meaning of life after an incredible loss. Third, it's about compassion and sacrifice, and people who come together - without knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. Almost every beautiful scene in this movie is important; there is nothing unnecessary here. It's a serious and moving movie. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer, who complements the scenes nicely. <br /> <br /> Some recommendations, especially for people dealing with human rights ... and people who want to know, "What purpose can I serve?" <br /> <br />
