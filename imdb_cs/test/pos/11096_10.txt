FALCON AND SNOWMAN is an excellent example of a film from the 1980s. While many other films of the decade generally lacked substance, this film is a pure substance. There is nothing stylish or false or redundant. It boasts two outstanding performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were triumphant actors from the early 1980s, all staring at much bigger and better things (all 3 played in TAPS). While Penn's and Cruise's popularity has risen, Hutton has been largely forgotten and it's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of 3 to win an Oscar for a supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more pronounced. Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam war revolt in his character Chris Boyce. Unsuccessful student of the school seminar, Chris has a relationship of love and hate with his father, who plays great actor Pat Hingle. The scene in which Chris quotes his poem, which his father thought he had forgotten for a long time, is extremely powerful. Chris gets a job in the defense department and uses his hatred for US governments and foreign policy. to sell seemingly unnecessary plans to old Soviets projects. He gets his friend Daulton, a hyper-drug-self-server, to be a microfilm project plan courier. While Chris is doing this on the basis of his beliefs, Daulton is doing it strictly for money. Soviet contact is well played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have real unpredictable chemistry, and it's kind of a funny set of exchanges between them. But don't make a mistake, this movie is different. It is a serious study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and distrust. Hutton delivers brilliantly underrated performance like Chris, a rather clever young man who has so many options. Penn, as usual, makes a huge character like Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks, and most of the time he doesn't think. The end of this fact-based film is very sad on several levels. A really powerful character study.
