I hope you have done this to those of you who have spoken to this film earlier and hoped to see it again. It was aired today (November 28, '04) on the Lifetime Movie Network. Subscribe to Dish. Karen Arthur was directed by William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this Southwest Gothic story, expertly. Lighting, editing and dialogue have made a significant contribution to the film, and Hershey and Peterson have been perfectly cast for roles, both by playing sensitive, fat and intuitive characters. The game on screen was excellent as well as supporting cast. We didn't know it was time, but I figured correctly that the story was based on truth, and now that I know, I have to stay. because Santa Fe is a leap, a jump and a jump from Tucson. As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique staircase design and the man who designed and built it (who was the Angel?). But the story, and these are a few graphs of how it happened, is what captivates you the most. Certainly you have a strong feeling that God in His Heaven is in every detail of this drama in history. You know what I'm talking about for you who saw the movie. For those of you who haven't done it, I'm not gonna ruin it for a minute ...
