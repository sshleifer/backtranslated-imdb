I saw this movie last night at the "pre-Code" film festival and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head to the opening detail, the whole audience gasped. It was just so beautiful. Cooper's look looks aside, this film shows Rouben Mamoulian's direction to perfection. Gorgeous scene-fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian just explores the overhead media and comes up with innovation. This was Sylvie Sidney's first role in Hollywood, after she succeeded in the New York phase, and she is as beautiful as Gary Cooper's leading lady should be. It's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than she was given - so often she seems to be afraid of being hit. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of famous faces in this area, including Wynne Gibson. Most notable is Guy Kibbee, who is best known for playing rich rich men, as a funny and indifferent hit-man. Almost enough of these pre-code movies are not available on VHS or DVD, so if you can't find a festival in front of your code, try broadcasting Turner Classic Movies! Regarding a reviewer who believes Gary Cooper was too stupid to have a dialogue more complex than "Yeah" or "No," he should perhaps consider Coop's performance in films like "Pan Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe" . Even though heaven knows someone who looked good, they shouldn't be just as smart.
