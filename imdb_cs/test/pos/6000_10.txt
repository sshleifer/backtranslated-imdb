Gulliver's travels are at the beginning a satirical novel by the great misantropa named Jonathan Swift. Therefore, it is not recommended to consider this film alone. We have to go deeper into the conscience of a man to get to the point where Swift would lead us. Gulliver lived the path of truthfulness, loneliness, fear of what could be his true life. We can't just sit back and watch the movie, say it's so cutie or so boring. The matter is far behind, and I would like everyone to expect it. This is the biggest movie ever if you can feel the truths that emerge from Ted Danson's character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
