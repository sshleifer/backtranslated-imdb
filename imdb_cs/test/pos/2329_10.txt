I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is cheerful but also has a heart. Stingray SS-161 (USS Pampanito) was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful, the work of art comes alive. So it was part of a diesel engine, so what? I learned that the USS Ranger (who was behind the Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was "conventionally powered", which could mean that the Ranger was also diesel. My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can be on the stingray from Korea! This may expire in 1966! Buckman: (Fingers out and taste it) What's going on, sir? It still tastes like creamy corn. Pascal: (Shouting) Besides, it's DEVILED HAM !! Buckman: That would be a problem. It seems to be a story, maybe tense. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to care for him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered but yet seaworthy enlisted class, and assigns him the task of using sub oil to avoid the nuclear navy and 'attack' Charlston Harbor, and Norfolk. Two-star Admiral Graham (with an eye on his third star and grudge against Dodge) assigned him a staff crew hoping to spoil Dodge to lose. Can Tom Dodge get the crew to speed and work as a team, and can take old, outdated under, and beat the best navy?
