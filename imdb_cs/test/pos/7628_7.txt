Stupid beautiful. This film embodies "so bad that it's a good" movie genre. The only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark and only Boone is good. It's a bit sad that a man who rose to fame like a Paladin should end up in this ugly pile of celluloid. While spinning in a fantastic performance, I couldn't help but feel that he had surpassed all of his teammates in this work that he shouldn't be there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this movie are ridiculous but fun. The idea that a dinosaur is buried in a cave wall and suddenly comes to life is a gold B-movie. When a 'triceratops' gets killed, watch it fall. It is clear that the stunt artist in front of the costume knows the best time. He falls to the ground before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit. Speaking of 'suits', there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur, in this movie. It looks like he has some secret technology, because Bunta (supposedly the best tracker in the world) won't notice it until he gets into the game. I don't know how all the prints are, but in the version I own, Tyranno Roar contains Godzilla's trademark below. This is a lot of fun when you watch if you like bad movies. I love them, and especially bad monster movies, so I consider it the jewel of my collection. If bad movies are your thing, be sure to get this.
