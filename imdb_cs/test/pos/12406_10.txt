The effectiveness of this image has been best demonstrated to the target audience, namely teens. My 14-year-old son became so immersed in this movie that I rated it significantly higher than his imitator "Mad City." This has triggered a debate in our household on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty vs.. For this I evaluate this film 10! Parents should look at it with their teens and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I really liked smart dialogue and consistent action. I thought James Remar was adequate in his role, but the teenage actor really did carry the picture. Other IMDB users have praised the performance of Corey Feldman, who is truly inspired. All in all, I give this picture to my highest recommendation. Go get this!
