After spending a lot of my youth watching these movies, I found it very easy to follow both the unedited and the cut versions, (although the story has more to keep together in an unedited version. Ninja Scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and I think this is where the animation hit me while the grainy is very original, and I like how artists this year highlighted the shadows to show different emotions. I think the story is perfect. The film really hits hard and as the film progresses, you get the feeling that you go along with your characters in this character adventure as they meet, become allies and discover their biggest strengths, a lot of heart has been put into it.
