I got "Summertime" myself in the 5th year of our spring choir concert. Since then, Gershwin's music has been a great recognition for me. I love the terrible melodies of this opera Gershwin. When I was 5 years old (about 10 years old), I got an LP for training and also loved the soundtrack. I recommend to see this movie and if you can get a soundtrack, get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - old, used LP. I was looking for and looking to try to find a CD soundtrack. The song on this one has an amazing musical arrangement, and I really wish it was on a CD to buy and also wished they would restore the movie and put it on DVD. It is a really great job that I think the present and future generations will benefit and benefit from. Some may think that the movie is slow and boring, but I'm the opposite. Although Poitier and Dandridge have dubbed music voices, I think the voices fit well into faces and personalities. The voice of the talking person and the voice of the singing can be quite different. Porgy and Bess and the songs from this opera will always be of particular importance to me.
