"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangsters" films noirs France ever produced.Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who did "bout de souffle", Godard's thing, same year), Marcel Dalio and great backing Cast, Brilliant Screenplay by José Giovanni-who also wrote "le trou" Becker's masterpiece of the same year! What year for him, beautiful black-and-white cinematography Ghislain Cloquet.And tense action, first-class director Claude Sautet, who surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville, since this film features a gangster movie with metaphysical assumptions that sometimes takes more than two hours, Sautet drives the men of flesh and blood, and the presence of these two children adds moments to the extraordinary Idea that Melville could never create. And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentiment: when Ventura sees her children last, in the subway (subway) she is the peak of limited emotions. Ventura depicts a gangster who is an E die being cast when the movie starts. He thinks he can count on his former acquaintances, but they're all cowards — we're far from the manly friendship of dear Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi") that Melville was to continue throughout the 1960s - sometimes attended by average women (film noir misogyny par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inform - we are far from the simplified behavior of Jean Seberg in Godard "opus" -. Cascading works with the picture: a beach scene in a carefree night when both kids see their mother die after being fired with customs officers is absolutely stunning. <br /> <br /> There's a good use of the voice that Sautet uses only when needed, so the last lines make the end even stronger than if we were in the scenes. Claude Sautet found a good niche and he followed the "classes of tous risques" rules quite well with his sequel "l'arme à gauche" (1965) which featured Venus again and made good use of the desert island and ship.From this vein continued, France would have Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, just "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed something brilliant he showed up in the first half of the 1960s. He became, from "les choses de la vie" onwards, a cinema de quality director who used to focus on the tender bourgeoisie in such works as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972) "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
