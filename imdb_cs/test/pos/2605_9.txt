I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello movies I've seen in the theater. Most of them are now seen on T.V. And I have to admit that Lou is really funny and he gets a girl too. It was the first time I saw Dorothy Provine appear and of course I fell in love with her like so many others. I saw most of the work she did and enjoyed it. Her performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the disc first! Every commentary on this movie says this is one movie that Lou Costello did with Bud Abbott, which is true, but if Lou lived, he would do many more. She really has a good job and doesn't have to rely on her old routines to laugh. I'm sorry that the little man from Patterson, N.J. I don't have a chance to do it. <br /> <br /> I hope it will come out on the DVD some time to add it to my comedy / sci fi collection.
