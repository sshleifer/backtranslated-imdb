A stunning view of the ocean and life in it. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is beautifully executed. It was interesting to see all the different animals I could never imagine. David Attenborough has a perfect narrative voice. No one could do anything better. Bad: <br /> <br /> There was one or two different times when there was a link to Earth's 1 million year old (I pay another faith). Overall, the TV series is anyone. I highly recommend buying. 10/10 Stars.
