the movie touches the soul of the audience greatly, some scene in the movie is final and tears come out automatically, I'm surprised to see this movie that every director can direct this type of film in 1925. cinema can say that this movie helps a lot to understand use montage.first time when our teacher told us about this movie means the genre of this movie we thought nothing could be in this movie to understand but eventually when sir explained it then we came to know how big this movie is. I can say that it helps a lot of understanding of the movies. And to be a cinema student I can see viewers that can see this movie.
