A very powerful drama of Faulkner's little town in the south dealing with the murder of innocent black local ne'er do wll. Striking cinematography and good storytelling (via flashback) take us into a troubled relationship between the suspect and his lawyer's son. Still a powerful story that precedes Sidney Poitier's films of racial prejudice. Porter Hall plays a big role as the father of the murdered man. Trivia: It was actually shot in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Miss.
