It is funny, intelligent and, in a sense, a realistic 14-year-old comedy that seeks to live its first love of vacation, as well as a complex, sometimes fun, sometimes touching relationship between a divorced father and her. a growing daughter ... and how far women (not just Nicole, a teenager) can go to marry the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this live scenario, which never pulls.
