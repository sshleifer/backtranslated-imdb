I love this film just as anyone loves watching what they saw when they were young. It was one of those movies that the Home Box Office showed every other day in my youth. This movie is forever stored in my brain. For someone who hasn't grown up around this movie, maybe you've become a spoiled ADD cycle since we were in the mid-1990s and it's more difficult for us to appreciate this gem. cool it is because my sis was doped to "better dead" before i saw it (of what I raped and loved) - and no one, NO ONE can deny the embarrassing teenage humor in the american cinema in the 80s everything we found tiring in tedious comedies because of all the overuse of the slow, contemporary soundtrack, new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS A Teen Comedy ... YES!
