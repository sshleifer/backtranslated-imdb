The tightly-fledged musical family, a slavishly benevolent father and four live teenage daughters, are rooted in the first place by the young composer Felix, and the second deepest Mickey, his extraordinarily attractive friend of the orchestra. Michael Curtiz takes a while to make this piece of America float. The first part looks almost like a paraphrase of commercial cereals, not without any curious, highly bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield enters the scene as a condemned Mickey, making his first appearance in movies, with disheveled black curls, sleepy, hanging over his eyes, rude and disheveled , the absolute opposite of Jeffrey Lynn's convincingly convincing, crazy-looking Felix. Garfield is in full condition and DIRELY needs counterpoint to the rest of the household ("Nothing I would do would not surprise me", thinks) and suddenly the film becomes interesting, although I agree with the critics who find that the plot is not motivated enough. Four sisters are pretty playful and seriously underwritten, but Claude Rains as a stage familias has its moments. Watch it at Garfield. just a really permanent thing about it.
