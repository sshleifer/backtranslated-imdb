The box box comes, "100 TRAPPED PASSENGERS ... 3,000 VENOMOUS VIPERS!" You almost have to admire the peace "no chance in hell that we will ever fill with this promise" crap. I could admire Asylum hucksterism more, if films did, well, you know, they were good or at least worth it. Haha, and that's what I like about these movies. They're garbage. You put them in the toilet and then washed away. It is worth the price if you are a fan of kitschy movies. It can become a cult classic of many fans. Gore scenes are effective, not much can I say is this From a movie that parodies a new movie with Samuel L. Jackson, hell, it can be better so who knows!
