It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11 year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the agent, the seeker of truth, the rectifier of all the mistakes in the world. One day Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) get the word that faith is dead. Faith was killed. Both Phoebe and Gail are amazed at this news, and although they are sad, Gail mourns. Phoebe can't let it go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe to find out what happened. It's 1977 now. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to Europe for her mother's objections to discover the truth. When she was alive, Faith was inseparable from the man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Though Wolf said he didn't know anything about Faith's last days, Phoebe would convince him to tell her everything. Within a few days, Wolf realizes that he has not gone into the past, and joins Phoebe on his journey to Portugal. Finally, Wolf is able to tell about Faith's dignity in drug abuse and his own guilt, which does not prevent suicide. Although Phoebe is upset, she finally realizes how truly human and fragile the faith was. I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the Red Army's bank robberies, and in 1969 I was 10 years old. I still remember young men trying to decide whether they should go to Canada or avoid it. The story is simple, but it has appeared in real life several times in this period. Camilla Belle was entertaining and entertaining as she stared at the young adored sister, excited about what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster easily got older Phoebe. Blythe Danner has always been a supportive mother, a role she likes too much about on American television. I'd like to see her with a stronger material to work with. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Although sometimes her performance as a 1960s activist looked like a newspaper disc. Of all the characters, it was Christopher Eccleston's Wolf, the greatest wolf. When we get to know the character at the beginning of the movie, we can see he's a secular man. He is a patient and kind man full of anger at world injustice. Finally, he realizes that the direction of faith is wrong and begins to "grow up" by deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith rejects him in this and ultimately leads to her death. Eccleston's wolf is the most real of all characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was pleasant and provocative. "The Invisible Circus" is rated as a TV-MA, but there is very little curse, sex or violence in it. The subject of the film is the reason for the rating.
