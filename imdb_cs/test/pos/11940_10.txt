The stolen shipment of Vigoroso, Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl trying to recover her life and leave her husband, the boss of an Italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old pet. This is a plot of "shipment", a country comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite his simple and classic story, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has his fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter), looking at Vigoroso Green Pill, says, "What is it?" Mint Candy? Or when a girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when a Vigoroso ship ends up in the lake, the final sequence ... The cast offers some nice performances: Matthew Modine as Paradise Valley sheriff who still loves his old girlfriend; and Elizabeth Berkley, who "has her character still loves her old friend ... The support cast, including Nicholas Turturra, Paul Rodriguez (as Jos√® Mexican) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...), makes the Oscar material pleasant but not so bad, funny comedy without pretense.
