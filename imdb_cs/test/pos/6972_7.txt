Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a wife in Long Island who runs away from marriage when she finds out she is pregnant. She plans to go to the heart of America and start over. On the way there is a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan), who calls himself 'Killer'. They soon discover that a good-natured "killer" is actually damaged by the brain, and unknowingly assumed a huge responsibility by picking it up. Two of them go all the way to Nebraska, where Sara gets a Killer job that helps him out on the road. This is where Sara meets Gordon, a local cop, and it will soon be terribly bad for everyone. This is a powerful drama about people who are disconnected from society, alienated from the choices they make or borders. imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very loose attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be expressed through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complicated, different role, and there are times when she managed to inspire something. One of my favorites is when he is first on the phone when he calls her home. It is such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of the word it is so little talked about. Then comes the character 'Killer' played by James Caan. This character is unlike those I have ever seen playing and performs beautifully. It is one of his best performances because he is very restrained and moving. The way Coppola develops characters with short, dream-like flashbacks is very clever and adds a fragmented look. Fast flashes that are graphical and stand-alone contrast well with longer shots in some key scenes. Also, since this film was filmed locally throughout the eastern US, it offers an interesting, authentic view of America in the late 1960s. I haven't seen many other films starring Mrs. Knight, I'm just familiar with her newer work on television, usually playing an ugly mother or a lousy old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so beautifully delicate in this movie. It's also a pity that James Caan continued his career as a "tough guy" because the film proved to be capable of much more than that.
