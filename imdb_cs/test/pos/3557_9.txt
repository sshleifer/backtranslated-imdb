Situational comedy really takes me up; You feel that you always know what is coming, so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hello Hi, you rarely know what's coming and it's laughing out loud. I just bought my second series (series -4-4) and I'm surprised how much I like it - again. I have nothing but praise for writers or actors (or many invisible crew members) because the fun they provide is worth a wait. The gems that come from this series and the respect that actors have achieved through speaking for themselves. Croft and Perry have created some pure gold, some of which shine through Hi Hi Hi.
