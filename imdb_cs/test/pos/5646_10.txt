My first Ichikawa for many years, and the first of his war films that I saw, was frantic and brutal from the outset. In the first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is named that he cannot continue with his unit he returned from the hospital. Apparently has TB? but he's not sick enough to be taken by the hospital with regard to the amount of wounded they have. But his old unit wouldn't take him back; his CO gives him a grenade, and tells him that if he feels really hopeless to blow himself up, it's an honest thing to do. for PFC Tamura and all the others. Nobi is a odyssey through hell, or rather hell? the forests, dead rocky plains, and dead and dying Japanese soldiers who hoped to end only with peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in stunning black-and-white space to highlight both the despair felt by Tamura and those he encounters on his way to its destruction, and to show how truly all are small and naked amid the immensity of mountains and forests ? "This little matter of people will end soon, the country seems to say, but I will survive and hardly notice. and the rest of the film tries to stay alive, stay human and get out of danger. In any case, he fails to do very well, slowly starving and eventually committing some repulsive acts. Finally, he joins two other desperate men who have lost or survived their troops and resorted to cannibalism? And in his weakened state facing other armed men, he found that the only way to live was to break everything he believed. in. Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and do not keep in mind like a scene with a man on top of a mountain who practically begs Tamura to eat his body? A repetitive black-and-comic bit with Tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for better skinned comrade leather, the degradation that humans survive to survive. A masterpiece that I won't be watching for a long time. Tracked through beautiful DVD Collection Criteria.
