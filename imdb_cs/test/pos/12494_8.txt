And I love it !!! Wonder Showzen picks up a cult audience and once it is canceled, selling the DVD goes over the roof. It's a very entertaining show in its own ways. It's a parody of children's shows, specifically on Sesame Street. Our puppet figures consist of Chauncy, a yellow furry monster with a hat whose host is ours. Clarence is a blue lizard as a thing that makes his own segments where he goes out on the street. He is a strange dog who is involved in a third person. Wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows. Then there is an announcer and a pink puppet. It's a very entertaining show, not as ugly as you'd expect, but rather a situation. They take 7 years on the street, tell them what to say, and let them make jokes they don't understand. My favorite segments are Clarence videos, especially when someone doesn't want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was similar to a show, but this is still a very funny show that I hope will come for years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 of *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA.
