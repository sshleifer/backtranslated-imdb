I agree with most comments by Mr. Rivera and I just want to point out a few alerts. This film "Mascot" is being neglected in its current form. In this regard, it is "Vampyr". "The Maskot" is not a "bonus feature" - it's like a chapter in "Vampyr". Although it is clear that this is a separate film, it should be treated as a manufacturer. And while I'm on "Vampyr" needs some of the same respect and housekeeping anyway, I feel that the decision to give Mascot there went something like that. Dude A: "We've just uploaded a Vampyr to DVD, but it takes about 20 minutes. We have to put something in there, which won't cost much. You can believe movie critics want to be paid to talk about "Dude B:" Don't worry. I have that little animation thing that sits in my drawer. Go ahead and add it as another chapter. "Dude A:" You're amazing, Dude B. " there is no need for me to repeat what Mr Rivera has done so well. However, this thing needs some great cleaning and restoration, especially the sound. The inclusion comes in the dialogue. And in my copy there were so many hiss, pop and places where the sound just dropped right away (I wouldn't know what that dog went without No amount of volume caused the words to be more comprehensible, it only brought tinnitus and made a hiss and loudly appeared: Starewicz's films must be put into a respectful collection, cleaned, scattered, line notes, and nine. yards.
