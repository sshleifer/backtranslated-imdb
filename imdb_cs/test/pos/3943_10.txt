This may be wine, but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. I did that I spent most of the first half of an hour wondering what the hell was going on, but once I accepted that I would never understand everything from the headlines that I could enjoy the movie. to hate a movie in which an employee turns into a flock of birds that will be released over the enemy? What matters to the character development when faced with a lesbian extraterrestrial princess whose people have built pyramids? Why Does Buddha Wear Seriously Blinging Diamond Earrings? She has one of these things when she faces the sheer luxury of visual expressions and humorous humor characters. Any battle for my heart was won as soon as I saw the main protagonist dressed as a spider - amazing! Many people will complain about the lack of coherence of the stories, but the fun movie will laugh with a bunch of friends you can't do better.
