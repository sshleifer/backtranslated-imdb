An interesting pairing of stories, this little film can bring together seemingly different characters and storylines in the background of World War II and manage to unite them without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth depicted by the different characters, and how much I felt I understood them and their motivation, even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. Exceptional actors' ability to play with this image is easy to record. A fun, stylized movie with lots of comic moments and lots of other events that are shaking your head. <br/> 7/10
