I feel very happy to have the opportunity not only to watch this movie, but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an excellent image that gives a full sense of story without getting into the usual Hollywood traps - yes, it shows up with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his politics and the policy of an ever-developing independent Congo. The film is brilliantly made, moving at a tempo that is consistently entangled. I look forward to the next Raoul Peck films as well as to other Eric Ebouaney movies!
