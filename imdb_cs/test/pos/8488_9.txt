A few days ago, I saw the amazing "House of Sand and Fog" and was impressed by Ben Kingsley's amazing performance in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray" trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Best Actor Best Oscar. After watching Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be honored. I like Ray Charles, I wasn't his fan, but it's a great resemblance to Jamie Foxx with him. The film is completely supported by Jamie Foxx, who is involved in most of the shootings, and his movements on stage seem to be Ray Charles's reincarnation. In view of the story, I have seen an extended DVD version, too long, but also very nice, with many beautiful songs and scenes depicting mainly Ray Charles's junkie. The biggest surprise was that Ray Charles was a heroin addict and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was a boring part of the film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Ray"
