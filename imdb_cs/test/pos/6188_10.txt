There is something about seeing a movie in a good, old-fashioned movie house that adds an enormous appeal to every image. Fortunately, at the New York Film Forum, I saw a couple of Ernst Lubitsch comedies during their three-week homage to the legendary director. I have twice participated in the screening of Lubitsch's Bluebeard's Eighth Wifeh comedy and a classic pre-coding design for a life I have never seen before. Everything I read about Design for Living appreciated the movie, but I couldn't find a good review anywhere for Eighth Bluebeard Wife. Leonard Maltin didn't like it. The videohound also gave the comedy a low rating. The IMDB score wasn't free. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) blasted the film in her scary review. So, when I went into town that day, I expected to enjoy Bluebeard's Eight Wife just lightly and love Design for Life completely. Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (who appeared first) began because the eccentrics who settled in the cinema took their seats and the music of the 1930s withdrew. "Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Eighth Woman Erneb Lubitsch's Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," the title card wrote. Then the picture opened with a cheerful scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he doesn't want any bottom! He gets into an argument with an official who seeks the help of his senior bosses, and theirs seems to be no end to the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming and talented cinema personalities. "I'll take the bottom," she begged kindly. And here you also have comedies that are best when you meet cute. The film miraculously kept me. When Colbert finds out, just before the family portrait is taken, that her groom-to-be was married seven times, the whole theater broke down to histeric. When he negotiates for money immediately after he gets through her shock, they ridicule laughter (which hasn't stopped yet). And Edward Everett Horton also came out of a merry reaction scenario. When Cooper takes inspiration from Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew when he grabs his wife by hitting her face, I couldn't control my laughter as he slapped him back. And the drunken pore scene is one of Claudette Colbert's most entertaining comic scenes. The greatest comedy moment of the film came when Colbert built the boxer to "teach his husband a lesson". He throws out a bad man in pure screwdriver mode, but instead puts his friend David Niven in a cool sleep. He wakes up when Cooper comes. To cover the situation, Colbert himself puts a fist on Niven at the moment of strong sexuality, and asks, "Where did the man hit you?" Here? Right here? Right here? ' and then BAM! it will knock him again! The movie was amazing, it was a perfect pleasure from start to finish. I also loved Design for Living, even though I dare say that I think that for complete laughter and fun, the eighth wife of Bluebeard is a better and more fun movie. There is some magic to see the vintage movie on the big screen. And in the presence of other laughs, one feels more comfortable. This is perhaps why I felt the way I did about Bluebeard's eighth wife.
