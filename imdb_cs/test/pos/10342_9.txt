Walking through the channels I was lucky enough to come across the beginning of this movie. I have to admit he almost immediately caught me. I like older movies and that's or should be considered a classic! One of the most beautiful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only a woman, but she was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
