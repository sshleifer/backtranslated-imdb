It's really bad that nobody knows about this movie. I think if it was too little and if it weren't so low, I think one of the biggest movie companies might want it. For the first time I saw this movie when I was 11, and I thought it was so powerful with many big but illegal lengths that Mitchell only goes to keep his family together. That inspired me, and now I'm impressed. If you're lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
