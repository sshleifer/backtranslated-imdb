While in one country, Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali joined forces to create a benchmark for short subject matter, film surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney, and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most important of the first synchronized audio cartoons (was found that it was not the first, unlike other reports). It is also one of the more successfully simplistic and humorous of Mickey Mouse shorts (still in a silent movie way - the only sounds are small irks and bleeding from Mickey and animals). It also goes pretty fast in its less than ten-minute run. But in these minutes one gets an immediate sense of how much Disney has with his characters, and how the newly used sound changes change as his work uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to talk about, just random things happening and happening because of Mickey (err, Steamboat Willie) on this boat on the river. And like Mickey Mouse's shorts, his lack of speaking is an advantage. It is necessary to see it if you haven't seen it as a child, but if you have it, it can still be worth a look.
