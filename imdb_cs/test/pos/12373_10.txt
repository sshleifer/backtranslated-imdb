A lot of words without words. It's an excellent movie. It was made in color uncolored as in today's movies, but with a special black and white use (with shading) that displayed meaning, mood, meaning, and time. It should be seen in color because it becomes a completely different film. The Nobel Prize of Selma Lagerl√∂f is presented effectively. One never has a clear sense of reality, memory or phantom. The changes taking place in the Swedish company at that time are gently layered. I warmly recommend. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in the Swedish film class and want to add it to my movie library.
