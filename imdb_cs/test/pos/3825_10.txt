What can I say about the NEW OUTSIDE LIMITS ... Hmm .... Just that it was one of the best TV series ever made! You have actors of all ages, actors who are somewhat familiar and that time has forgotten. Everyone who plays their part to perfect perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story that is mostly (if not all the time) very true! You feel that a man whose voice is dubbed over credits and at the beginning and end believes in what he says with all his heart! Not only do these shows have great storylines, they will also throw you into them, get your mind into races and a blood pump. The original external limits were black and white in the 1960s, and these shows made a triumphant comeback I never saw! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun, but the new EXTERIOR LIMITS are where it is! If you haven't seen: Please check these episodes and see exactly what I mean! LONG LIVE NEW EXTERNAL LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
