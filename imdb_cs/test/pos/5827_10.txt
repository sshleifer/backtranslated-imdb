This is a great show! A very underrated dramatic show. It's great as there are no main characters and every episode of some other character is the main character. I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He's a tough, bad guy and an Aryan who makes him a real bad guy in a prisoner who is known to be a lot. This show has many murders, I think it's a bit exaggerated for the show, but I have to admit it's one of the reasons I think the show is so big. Soon, but some still have their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break with this show are completely different. I think some of the actors at the show are also very good and underestimated and should be. Great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered great for the coming years.
