... as valuable as the tomb of King Tut! (OK, maybe not that it's worthwhile, but worth it, if you can). I have noticed that no one has commented on this film for several years, and I hope that the new post will spark some new comments. It's a movie I only remembered from childhood excerpts, and I recently saw myself being tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past and hunt for a Korean DVD (in English but with unrecoverable Korean subtitles). I won't go through another long description of the conspiracy - just say that when I first saw it in its proper widescreen format, I left the agape on the vistas and the scope of the movie. Frosted images are still held and palace sets are truly breathtaking. However, they are smaller details that give this film its depth and richness and offer a glimpse into the lifestyle of Egyptian poor and its elite. Bazaars, shacks, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as the throne of Pharaoh's throne. While large-scale errors (most notably dynastic succession) are abundant, details are examined in more detail than the vast majority of Hollywood movies. Visually it is not without its defects - the interiors are often too oversized and colorful in color with the exteriors. However, this is a movie that should be credited for being as bold in the small as it is in the big. Suddenly? Partially absolutely. Overwrought? Underacted? Yes, both - though "underestimated" may be a more descriptive description. Too long? Definitely not. I wished they would spend more time with Sinuhe's experience in the House of Death and between Hittity and less with his "romance" with Nefer. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but Shakespeare as well. Nobody's cheating on him. I appreciate the historical accuracy as well as the next guy, but in the end it must be remembered that cinema is a theater, not a history lesson.
