"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre, great horror movie from the 1970s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who travel in a jeep across a desert area. Their two other friends, Eileen and her friend Woody, are in a separate car. When the bike starts, Woody takes him to a nearby gas station - and fulfills the horrible fate of some bizarre telekinetic chaos and some scary mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to the local "trap" museum. The car breaks randomly in front of the entrance and the girls find an oasis where they can swim, approached by Mr Slausen, who runs a roadside attraction that is now closed. He took them to the old Western wax museum and the girls stayed while he and Jerry go to fix their car. Curious from two, Eileen travels to an old house near where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a lot of life like a dummy. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go looking for her. That is, when real horror begins, and telekinetics (can move objects with his mind), Mr. Slausen's masked brother begins to kill teens one by one, while controlling his large number of human-turned mannequins. Sounds similar to the "House of Wax" remake of 2005? Well that is. I've heard of this movie, but I've never seen it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I see a remarkable resemblance of two film shares - "Tourist Trap" was probably a big contributor to the remake of "House of Wax". The dummies in this film are scary to start with, some with moving eyeballs, some with no eyes at all, and some with falling mouths that sing as well. Singing was extremely fearsome when you asked me, and the dummies were enthusiastically designed. Dummies are scary to start with, they are so alive but they really are not. The film narrowly mixes elements from the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (masks using assassin are similar to those in Leatherface), with a little of the original "Wax House", and telekinetic powers that are depicted in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfying. Telekinesis was a pleasant touch for the film, the killer was all the more threatening and inevitable. The masks were scary and the plaster scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The score for the movie was really well done, if not exaggerated during some scenes. Activity doesn't have to be turnkey, but it wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shadow Mr. Slauston, who provided the character with a shady but friendly atmosphere. Young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, she is best known for her role on "Charlie's Angels" and more recently the sitcom "That '70s Show", starring Donna Mother. Robert A. Burns serves as Artistic Director, making a phenomenal work on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and also doing a good job of creating a crowded, musty atmosphere for both the museum and the old mannequin house. I found it a little strange that the original movie rating was PG, it seems too frightening to have such a tame rating, but the movie really isn't too violent. Overall, "Tourist Trap" is an incredibly unique, fast, extremely underrated horror classic. The full moon gave him a decent 20th anniversary DVD release, commentary was interesting and the picture was mostly clear and sharp, better than the video version. If you love older 70s slasher-horror movies, "Tourist Trap" is an underrated retro gem. 8/10.
