I thought this movie was pretty good. At three o'clock in the morning, it was at TCM (Turner Classic Movies), and his pernicious humor kept me up to five. Kelly has a beautiful role in this role, especially with her grandmother (whose joke almost made me laugh at my place). The main actress was fine, but her father was able to keep his character isolated from the marital conflict and keep the humor. If you like good offbeat, older movie, I would recommend it. Unlike other notes, I like Gene Kelly. He was a perfect leading actor for many early musicals and I think his charisma emanates from this role. One of the drawbacks is that dance scenes are a bit long windy, but if you can get through them, you are clean.
