Based on a true story. . . The prerequisite for this film is to show that through fairly common events it is possible for a "decent" mother to get out of her heroin addiction. *** semi-spoiler *** Some scenes are quite inaccurate - while others almost want to make you 'fix' yourself. A computer technician / graphic artist woman with a good relationship with her young teenage child spiraling into an addiction after a work colleague who is a 'wood chipper' (- someone who can take it + enjoy it over and over again -) Then A spiral to addiction that leads her ultimately to scoring 'street' dealers after losing contact with her stable dealer. Br /> <br /> The scenes that show her that they descend and are "sick" are often very real - especially the first real "night sweat". Before all these events, she began a relationship with a guy who had just lost his wife to the bottle, and insisted that he had an internal radar to avoid these women. Some radar! After a few late ups and strange behaviors, a friend asks her what's going on, his radar is getting more with him and demands that she empty her bag; hit the roof and go out. Due to the excellent and open relationship he developed before this tragedy, he is the first to find any real evidence in his bag; then he looks around at the hose for her 'stash' - apparently his sensitivity is from school lessons on drug use - and if he finds a big stash in the bathroom, he flushes it! HAPPY IS NOT A WOMAN when he takes his next bath and his "disappeared". The boy holds one back and places it on the dining table - she goes to the next denial - admits it and says its not worse than dope. <br /> <br /> The guy does all the right things and calls his friends and generally puts him in a position where he has to come "clean" - if you forgive the pun. > <br /> The film takes the viewer through some pretty challenging situations where the danger is not far away. Eventyully gets help from a professional organization and cold Turkey - you'll have to watch a movie to see what happens next. . . .
