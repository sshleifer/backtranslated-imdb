If they were to award awards for the most corrupt and most organized films in the world, Japanese cinema would clean up: their exploitative cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders, the most extreme example is the totally sniffing workout in bad taste, gore nausea, freakish weirdness, and misogynistic sex. Guts of Beauty is a prime example of such arid dirt that offers discerning viewers just over an hour of full shame and gratuitous violence. very crazy J-splatter goodness. The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister brought her to the hands of some ugly yakuza who tries to rape her and shoot her. full of powerful drug called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have had fun with a poor woman, she manages to escape and escape to a nearby hospital, where sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) is trying to help. However, upset and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing himself out of the hospital roof, turning to the water melon when he hits the ground (at least what it looked like to me!). Trying to avenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi attracts Higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office, and, while picking him up, hypnotizes him into attacking his gang member members. After Higashi is content with a knife at the yakuz headquarters, he is heavily beaten and stabbed, forced to talk about his meeting with Hiromi, and then hacked into pieces of biting pieces. The psychologist is then captured by a gang exposed at the site of a forced bugler (while simultaneously being forced to put his head to the yakuza yoke), and injected with Angel Rain? The Gangsters then slapped her body into the boot of his car, along with the remnants of Higashi ready for disposal. Before the corpses can dig, super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi. Coming back from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a jagged penis and a harsh gash, the blessing of revenge goes beyond killing yakuz one by one; this leads to some unforgettable scenes of an incredibly bloody splatter, including a chaotic head squish, a man being stewed by a monster's mud vagina, and a woman being scalloped to death by his giant, scratching phallus. as you can most probably say from the synopsis above, this is some crazy thing, a bad thing, and probably not the taste of most healthy people, but the strange people who have long been tired of mainstream cinema and are already familiar with the Asian surplus, Guts Of A Beauty should turn out to be a pleasantly diverted and deviant fun. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
