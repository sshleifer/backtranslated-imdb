This show is a show that is perfect for adults and children to sit down and watch. Stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children, boys and girls in my family and it's hard to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with them when they want to watch Mystic Knights. It's an amazing show and I hope they will continue to do it. All the children in my family and I think Vincent Walsh is the best of them. We have seen that he has done a lot of other work and thinks he is doing a great job. We wish all the actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers good luck and we just want to say that they are doing a good job.
