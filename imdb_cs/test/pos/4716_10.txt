I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, that was GOOD. Initially, as I watched it, I saw Laura Bowman's story, but later, after several appearances, I realized it was also a parallel documentary. It came in my mind, the story of Aung San Suu Kyi and the struggles of women to remain strong in the light of insecurity, danger and sadness. After another review, I would also list the history and politics of the list because I learned a lot about Burma's past and present and could only estimate her future. This movie is not just one you want to see, it's also one that will definitely want to have a copy. It's a film that the whole family could easily see, though not for children under the age of thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this film cannot, and should not be underestimated.
