I have not seen such a film where the filmmakers have put so much heart in their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time. Everything was well thought out and perfectly done. Working with cameras, editing and composition worked so well, it was just amazing. The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographic. This movie blew me away. <br /> <br /> "Showdown" could be reduced by 10 or 15 minutes. br /> <br /> It's an almost perfect tribute to the early silent noir.
