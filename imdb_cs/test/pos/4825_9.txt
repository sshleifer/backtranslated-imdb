From new acting to Cardon's direction, this new twist on a familiar spirit that has been done wrong will keep you stuck in place. Slowly occasionally, because it builds what happens, tension. Moderately good at gore, but what's pretty ugly. Spoiler: The death of jockhole and the subsequent throw is the highlight for gore hounds. The writers created an old story, but they added twists and once again imagined that you were a typical scary one. Cardone brings her to life. . . er. . uh death. Lori Heuring, Scout Taylor-Compton, and the wonderful Ben Cross are real, no sign of being here. Everyone in the cast is committed and really not what every director is trying to do. Actors believe and therefore we believe. Along with traditional surprises with the spirit of the story, the film is packed with a lot of atmosphere, from the mine, the Hank House and the Tunny House, from ghostly fright from first frame to last. Horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what's one of the true horror movies today. I'm quitting a great kudo Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (screenplay) for no imaginative Hollywood writers would be anything but an ugly TV party.
