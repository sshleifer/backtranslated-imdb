This is a pretty good movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but again has Roy Scheider, right after he did "French Connection", playing a cop called "Buddy". They also use the same over-memorable wheelman from "Bullitt". At first you will think that you have seen a chase behind the car if you still have a face in memory. Chase cars are great, but like in many car movie scenes, it has some technical and editing errors. Check "Puppet on Chain" and "French Connection II" for some other good, long, intense chases.
