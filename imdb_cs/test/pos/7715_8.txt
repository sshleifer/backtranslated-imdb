This is one of the anime movies from The Animatrix Collection, one of nine - the only one made in black and white, and the only featuring Trinity. Richly textured and beautifully rendered in every way, the animated version of the Trinity definitely makes her justice. If you're a fan of The Matrix, you'll have to put it on your short list.
