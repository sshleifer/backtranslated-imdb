The cell is weak for conspiracy, full of holes and also very miserable. But none of this is important because Tarsem Singh gave us one of the most visually stunning movies ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to deceive the tars and take you to the mind of a serial killer, giving listeners some shocking, pleasant, breathtaking and unobtrusive images. <br /> <br /> Pictures from this beautiful movie will stay with you for a long time. this film is a perfect case of "mistrust" theory. Forget the stupid conspiracy, let your senses stun images. and J.Lo looks great enough to add the rest of the work to the tars. cinematography is horrifying, haunted music and costumes just overwhelming. The film is less film and more artwork. just because the media is no longer a canvas, it's a big screen and a celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The cell must track. A bold new step in the film. Enchanting 8! <br /> <br /> 8!
