ENGLISH PATIENT not only has everything (condemned romance, tragic war, great characters), but it has no other film to do. It is a stunning story told through flashbacks with amazing performances of all involved, ugly visuals, characters we care about, and the most surprising love story ever told. A film milestone, the best film of 1996 and one of the best in the 1990s.
