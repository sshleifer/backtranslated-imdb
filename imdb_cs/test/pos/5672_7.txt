** SPOILERS ** Looking a little more excited than seeing crocodiles who are fed in local sisters' reservations, Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, along with friend Grace Adam, Andy Rodoredou, who decide to take a trip upstream in desert city. and abandoned, human housing, Australian mangrove swamps. With their swamp guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized ship four get up a giant sea crocodile that quickly grabs and pulls frightened Jimmy to the bottom along with him. Grace Pat & Adam end up stuck in a tree in a swamp with Pat hanging on an expensive life on an overturned ship. The rest of the film has a hungry and determined crocodile playing cat and mouse, or on the back and man, a trio game that ends in a mud clearing where Jimmy's dead and torn body finally came to rest. <br /> <br /> Both the director and the actors in the film make full use of the swamps that make her sometimes much more frightening than the giant crocodile that floats in her. In the video we see the crocodile murderers, but each one hits you and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam, right in the intestine. A giant reptile always makes its damage from below by coming so unexpectedly that attackers attack it, has a much greater effect when you don't see them come then, as in the last ten minutes of the movie when you do. Are you interested right from the start, who will eventually survive crocodile attacks and finally learn about them. The end of human confrontation with crocodile vrs was about the weakest and most realistic part of the film. Crocodile, who had been so clumsy and effective in earlier scenes, seemed to have broken through or swam, he himself felt neither strength nor speed, with his mortal jaws and finished the only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the murderer was so ineffective that even after he had taken his victim or victim, he could not hold on to them. It eventually turned out to be fatal on his side. Much like "Jaws" the movie "Black Water" has a crocodile killer, like a great white shark in "Jaws", more concerned with killing its human prey and then consuming them. With all the food available in the swamps and rivers inhabited by the crocodile, it was only after Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy that he was attacking his watery domain, which he thought was a great power. And for having dared to do that they had to pay with their lives!
