Ken Loach showed the world down and out to turn the side of Swinging London with "The Poor Cow", about London's Joy woman (Carol White) hook up with the thief and have a son with him, only to see a man finish in Slammer. While his Terence Stamp manages to help some of them, it turns out to be somewhat better in what's defeated. It is soon clear that Joy will have to make a serious decision about where he goes in his life. One thing I decided - I don't know if it's accurate - or not. was the use of irony in the film. Her name is Joy, but she has no joy in her life. Although it wasn't intended, it's still a movie I recommend to everyone. Featuring songs by Donovan (one of which - "Colors" - appeared in another film by Terence Stamp: "Limey" (which, by the way, came out in 1999, when I was as old as my parents were when "poor cow" came out )).
