This film was an amazing tribute to anyone who has gone through this type of pain and suffering. The action was not the greatest, I admit, but it was a passionate message, sending people to prisons without being a lawyer or some kind of court is cruel and unusual. They even had a damned trial for Saddam, so why not every suspect terrorist has any kind of fair and legitimate court or hearing about why they were labeled first? I'm leaving the movie, but I think it's worth noting that this sick, twisted thought has a government. The film's way of telling the story and backstage was a great mystery. The whole movie, I tried to connect a conspiracy with my daughter and it is very obvious. There is no doubt that directing was incredible, but one thing I didn't care about was that there was a lot of emphasis on the character of Reese Witherspoon and the struggle for the ideal she managed. Otherwise, it was actually pretty fun, and most of all I kept my attention and interest in the two hours she played.
