The role of the economy in the industrialized North American market must always be theoretically anchored in the home countries of engine creation. People and industrialists, such as Mercedes Benz and the Bavarian Motor Company (BMW), have certainly realized the opportunity of the North Ameirkan market to purchase fuel and the number of cars bought for the home. This type of economic phenomenon has prompted the Speed ​​Racer concept. After the new constitution of Japan, the industrialization of the isolated island nation of Japan must once again seek opportunities through economic partnerships with its global neighbors. It also helped to generate economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, if not in the global market. Speed ​​is a young, passionate driver who, without any better knowledge, is driven by his demanding father Pops Racer, who has challenged his whole life to make a better machine better in winning races. It was actually Pops Racer who drove his first son, Rex Racer, on the verge of destruction with his strategy of making the most of the technology he developed. As a mature Racer, Rex finally realizes his own values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels obliged to his younger Speed ​​harassment. <br /> <br /> Rex Racer's exact relationship with people like the Inspector is never quite clear, but dramatic. Finally, Rex is accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization because of his ability to be in places when there is no other explanation of how he knew Speed ​​was in trouble. Or the fact that it was some kind of illegal activity when its secret knowledge is being used against the evil plot. This brings the level of mantle and dagger romance to Speed ​​Racer. The mixture of innocence of Speeds with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance themes and graphs as they happen from episode to episode. Instead of a dry detective story, the excitement of an international racing car, romance cloak and dagger and human character comedy is embedded in one Speed ​​Racer story.
