Many films attempt to take universal themes and make comedy; but only a few of them stand up to this opportunity as "Control". The movie is brilliant. The dialogue is well written and true. Acting is absolutely nice. Peter Falk - as an actor; as an actor. He is able to carry the casting to size. Another great feat is Laura San Giacomo. She's such an interesting actress. Her performance surprises. No matter what role she should give - from Wack in "The Stand" by Stephen King to her TV show. However, "Checking Out" allows her to shine. It's the role he has to play. The film is superbly directed by Jeff Hare. In his cast he was able to bring the best and his direction - in all aspects - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult subject with laughter and yet deep. It gives us a detailed and personal view of why you need to create independent movies. The director's knowledge of his cast and script is extended to the finished film. The results are excellent. Hopefully it will be available to the big audience because it doesn't matter what you don't want to miss. It has the potential to be a sleeper hit of 2005 - in fashion "My Big Fat Greek Weddings."
