This movie is great. The best acting I've ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor and of course Hilmir Snær and Bjorn jörundur. Great music and sound. Cold hard reality about the fight of a man who has a lot of problems and people in his life. Black humor mixed with great acting and this European style of art films, it works, it meets in the best Icelandic film ever made. I tell you, "See this movie, you won't regret it". I gave her 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic film in your life ... See this
