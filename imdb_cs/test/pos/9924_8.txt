Dario Argento is a filmmaker I am slowly getting into as a result of the iconoclastic endeavors of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a filmmaker who would always take care of stupid things like "conspiracy". This could be his one underage (but obvious to me) liability: he won't leave a little thing like common sense to liquidate his plan for his elaborate killing sequence because his killer (s) can go through any complicated set-up of being invisible until until revealing around POV point of view of the psychopathic killer. But it is exciting to see a film director as well as such a purely Italian aesthetic that gets into the soul of Hitchcock's warp (in fact, as a note of interest if someone recently saw the short film Scorsese, where he took three pages of the non-film Hitchcock, which also took place in opera, Argento beat him for nearly twenty years, probably without knowing the lyrics). It's also incredibly 80's (CD players and heavy metal and hair, oh my!) And the absurdity that makes it all tastier to swallow. The story is simple: opera Macbeth is with highly stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. At the last minute, a talented star star, Betty, played by Marsillach appeared. But murder occurs during a premiere that was not interrupted by the falling light - and now the killer is after Betty! Can't she go to the police (how can the opera be really cursed?) But will it depend on the face of the killer who won't let it go? One of them probably saw spaces like this, which takes place in other films Argento - the girl is chased by a killer - but it is how Argento, like De Palma, constructs and executes his sequences, and adds a distinctive flavor to his own to add touch bizarre humor (ravens escape to attack the killer and subsequent relegation version), a kind of overly stylized ala Leone (bullet through the peephole door probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1), and even sado-masochistic inspiration with pegs drawn on Betty's eyes , more than once! Argento builds her actress through wringer, and she is the whole game for her, though things seem to get into "what-to-hell". up when she is led down a secret passage by a little girl, as if they are suddenly in Aliens now. And with such a dark genre material, Argento keeps the violence strong and fresh, tensions around as much as opera music coming directly from a stereo speaker, and a cameraman who may have had a few drinks (and rightly so!) During some scenes as they are shot and vibrate to the heart beat. It should be considered waste, but it has been lifted in the past over all genre constraints, thanks to the director's bald attitude, despite the stupid ending - stronger than anything that preceded what came before him (thanks to the little lizard) - and an attempt to break the curse of Macbeth, which unfortunately did not appear in real life on the opera scene. 8.5 / 10
