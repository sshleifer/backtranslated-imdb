I've seen this movie several times and it's very convincing and sad. The lack of real emotions of most characters is very worrying. They look empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. A teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no apparent reason - apparently it seemed to him. Then he can boast of his friends, and because he doesn't trust him, he takes them to the body - several times. Nobody reported this murder. There are two strong leadership - Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - Crispen Glovers character is seriously annoying. Keanu's character Matt seems to be the only one who has a sense of truth and wickedness. This is Keanu at his best - flawless performance and very believable - anyone who thinks this person can't act should watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the film. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. It is very sad to think that there are children. It's really grateful to you for what you have. 9/10.
