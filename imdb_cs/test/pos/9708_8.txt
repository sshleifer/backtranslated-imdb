That's what you expect. It induces laughter, crouching and dry-lifting, not necessarily in that order. It's a top-top. You will see things that you will never be able to clear from your mind. "Jackass Number Two" is better than the first; the actors have certainly taken more risk in filming this movie. There are many bits that could have killed actors, especially Johnny Knoxville. Animal treatment was suspicious, but in addition, the film achieved what was achieved. If you like the preview, check out the movie. If not, direct! <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
