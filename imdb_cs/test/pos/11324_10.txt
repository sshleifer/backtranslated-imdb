I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite t.v show on the night was hot night. I loved the characters and the story of the exhibition. I thought it was an excellent show and still does it today. I enjoy watching reps and I'm a big fan. I love the way characters play on each other. I've always been late to watch my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listen to the song theme.Which thought it was a great song for the show. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott.
