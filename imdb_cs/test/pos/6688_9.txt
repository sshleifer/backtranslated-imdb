I'm a Jeff Bridges fan, so I filmed it on DVD without seeing it before. I immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacey, too. The general plot of the "alien in the human body" was, in my experience, done to death, but I liked what I used in K-PAX, which occurred to me as completely different and much more sensitive than most . Bridges is an excellent doctor (you want him to tell you what you mean) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in this role. The interaction between Prot and totally human characters in the clinic is wonderful, especially the gentle handling of their behavior. The end is bittersweet - I like Prot's choice, but the last scenes (with Bridges) made me angry.
