Includes spoilers <br /> <br /> This is Peter Watkins. If one has seen his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "War Game", one identifies the style (and his voice) within seconds after launch. Made in 1971 is set in the very near future, when the Vietnam War escalated even more and now seems to include China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protests are handled violently by drum tribunals (outwardly civilians with "ordinary citizens" as judges). Because "the prison building can't keep up," an alternative is being introduced: Park of Punishments. Offenders can choose between severe prison sentences and hostile hunting, in this case an 85 km trip through California's desert to 100 degrees F. If they reach the American flag at the end without being caught by the National Guard or riot police, they will or they will be punished (or they will be dead, as we will see). The film is created in a totally documentary style with three European teams dealing with the tribunal and the conduct of two already convicted groups. Scenes jump between tribunal tent, hunting troop and hunted convict. Watkin's precious commentary gives us raw background information (time, temperature, etc.). The tribunal scenes show a kangaroo trial on the one hand and a wide range of personalities on the other, from real terrorists to "distrust" to clearly innocent (eg, a Total Pacifist who can't even hurt flies). A lawyer (who takes his job seriously) must take abuse from both sides. What makes these scenes particularly scary is their resemblance to the rhetoric of today's administration in detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert clearly show that the "rules of the game" do not really apply. This question remains open, whether it be from the beginning or arbitrarily manipulated by the soldiers for the events that lead to the result (I suspect it is both). At the end we are back on the square with the next group that goes to the "Punishment Park". This description may indicate a strongly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but that would be misleading. Behavior (all participants were unprofessional as usual with Watkins) looks and sounds real (tribunal scenes can even contain textual material from actual contemporary studies). I would say that it could be sold as a "real thing" without any problem. Watkins's "The Forgotten Faces" was a reaction "We can't send it or no one will believe our real papers (because it's indistinguishable from the real thing)". With "Punishment Park" it should be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know it has to see that it has not lost its power or its meaning (especially today).
