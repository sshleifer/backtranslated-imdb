The fast approach Lewis Seiler takes with the king of the underworld creates a deeper conspiracy while still running efficiently. One of the clearest examples is the transition between poverty and wealth of a married couple. The audience is immediately taken from a medical office to a luxury suite in the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position in which doctors have been cast. The intro story suggests that these two people are generally satisfied with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate. Suddenly cut off from this moral conflict scenario (crowd personal doctor), the viewer is asked to experience this sudden turn of events. Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) is forcibly employed by Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized idea of ​​organized crime, which is too influential and powerful to overcome, has become a standard part of every gangster image. One aspect of this film, which has raised some questions for me, has ironically addressed the pace of the story and the degree to which it has been said. I think that character development and social identity can suffer when some aspects of the story are not fully explored. This paradox becomes the result of personal tastes in that I think the movie experience can be enhanced by consistent character development. However, for the purpose of this film, I must admit that quick action contributes to the film's more dynamic impact. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (of ****)
