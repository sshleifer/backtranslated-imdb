I'm sick of the series with young and clueless people, talking about their "problems" all the time, with the center, boredom and totally annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc.). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, trusted people with REAL problems (thank God!) And a very, very good history. I just love it !! I hope the "Hack" will go on for a long time because it's a great TV series for adults, for a change.
