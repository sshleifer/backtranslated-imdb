Stunning artwork. You can watch every picture of the movie and see the beauty in it. First of all, when I saw the helmet of the German soldiers, I understood that it was from the moment that the "Star Wars" were quarrels inspired. The scene was to kill the baby is scary and when I saw it I didn't like it. But when the movie was over I was thinking about this scene and I changed my mind and thought that in World War 2 it was exactly what the Germans did. The Ice Battle Scene is one of the best war scenes I've ever seen (if not BEST). This way this movie combines music and so great stunning visuals are really great. Then Prokofiev's score is one of the most famous audio tracks in history and I thought it was the best. What more can you say, then the work of art. Eisenstein has created a stunning masterpiece, propaganda film and beautiful artwork. I am very happy because I just got a set of Eisenstein set criteria.
