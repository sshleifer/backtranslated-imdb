I really enjoyed this movie for the first time a few years ago and whenever it is broadcast somewhere (which happens from time to time on European cable TV), I do the same thing, I moved, I am entertained and ended up more movies like this. This is all about Lee (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in London, Leo as a homosexual who follows a friend to a merry New Age Men's Group and falls on a straight guy Brendon, playing lively James Purefoy, who turns out not so much after all. Built as side figures, Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving are equally great, whose side story itself is worth watching the film, Simon Callow as the leader of the male group, in great performance. But it's really hard to pick some people here because every character, women like Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter is also beautifully acting. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors, but it benefits from his somewhat subdued character. The idea of ​​this film is simple: it is never just black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always be a test of time. Leo identifies himself as a homosexual but ends up for a woman who turns out to be his teenage darling and Brendon's long friend. Brendon starts straight, but learns that gay can be more than just a possibility for him, and that a bisexual may not be so bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are homosexuals and love it, and even equal people in the movie, like Angie, Leo is a female roommate, get their fair share of love and humorous moments until the end of the film. The comedy bits (especially Tom Hollander, which is just hilarious) are funny and in place and emotions are believable as confusing as they may appear at the time of reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is its positive. Whether you are gay, straight, bisexual or just unsure, this film will leave you feeling that it's not okay, you're not sure and that "not sure" can also be something that would be worth it it could pay off! Sexuality is portrayed in this film as a fluid, and none of the main characters have a real problem with it, as opposed to all the struggles with homosexual and straight camps that you sometimes get in other gay movies. With the whole subtext of the film, I can only wholeheartedly agree that what you feel like one day when you think you identify yourself as gay, straight, anything, may look different on another. I have never seen bisexuality (maybe calling it?) Or maybe just the absence of a segregating need for sexual classification that would be portrayed in such a pleasing and true way of life. This film dares to go where there are few movies, gays or straight movies by not playing labels and stereotyped sex assumptions and relying on it. It goes even further and assumes that after the known classifications there may be sex life and I think times are more than prepared and other films exploring postmodern themes like this! And for all the others who don't care, damn it, it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy Saturday night with popcorn on your hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> He loved it!
