*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the immediate post-war years, something had to be in the air, making the night cities an attractive setting for movies. At that time, the hum of night city films was created, not only in America. One of the most remarkable was Odd Man Out, an English picture of a wounded gunman roaming the streets of Belfast. In America it was high noon, or better, high midnight movie noir. Crossfire is not really a film noir, but it has a noir trap, even though it uses them for their own goals, which have to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, was edited from Richard Brooks' novel. The book concerned homosexual murder; in the film, the victim is turned into a Jew. Although the film is filmed as a mystery, there is little tension in the film because it is quite obvious who the killer is at the beginning. What makes the film so attentive and beautiful is its city evocation, Washington, D.C., just after World War II, by some of the most talented artisans working at that time in movies. Unlike many night movies, Crossfire is predominantly set up indoors: at police stations, in homes, and in cinemas. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie and most of them are itchy to go back to their civilian life. However, most of the men we encounter feel that their personalities are so shaped by their military experience that it is difficult for them to return to their old neighborhoods; maybe even impossible for some. They seem to be more bound to each other than to something else or to anyone else. Some men, however, have never joined anybody in the army. The murderer, Monty, is one such individual. One feels that he has never been linked in civilian life. He is the only wolf who also needs people. He desperately has a sadistic stripe a mile wide and always needs someone to be close to jokes. The man he killed didn't hurt him and was actually a stranger to him. But once Monty found out that it was religion, it was enough. In fact, he didn't want to kill the guy because it was his intention to "just" humiliate him and just defeat him. But when he was quite drunk at the time, Monty's fists gave him better. It is this act that sets the story in motion. <br /> <br /> Once the movie creates a steam head, the other characters quickly get into focus. Monty's opposite number is Keely, another soldier who, although introspective, like Monty, and somewhat separate, has no resentment for anyone and seems to be a reasonable, even nice guy. Finley, a murderous smoking detective, is dandyish and tad effet compared to men in uniform, but proves more than a match for the various and mostly defiant soldiers he deals with. The actors who play these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking for someone to be picked up; and man can feel his anxiety becoming the victim himself. Like Keely, Mitchum is a low-key, almost nonchalant; never answering a voice; and it seems to have more to offer than is allowed by the script. His performance was often criticized as too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and pretty unconventional. He says against the stereotype of a stubborn cop and makes Finley a little prince of crime detection. There are some surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written, even brilliant. The character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in movies as a 'friend' of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and may or may not live with her, though she seems to be quite relaxed in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that there is nothing clear and this person seems to be more than confused about his role or should be. These few scenes are the thematic core of the film, which is anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the film are drifting, aimless and essentially lost, some more seriously than others. In this regard, Crossfire is for all sermons near the end a film of uncertainty about identity and how easily it can be lost or distorted. The men are moving from one bar to another in this movie because they are dealing with a kind of amusing friendship whose personalities combine into a general American male template. Then something happens, something gets nailed. A word is mentioned, whether it is a "Jew" or a "villager," and things suddenly change, and the very notion of individuality, identity outside the group, someone who doesn't like them becomes deeply offensive, even outrageous. Then, after the excitement of the outburst and anything that wakes them up, resolved or forgotten, the men return to their free, impersonal group normality, and order is restored.
