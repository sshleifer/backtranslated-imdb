GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos must be the best Robim Williams I've seen. It was like watching Robinson Williams when he was really and is. I had no idea that Robin was such a close friend to John Belushi as he was. The depiction of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on his own merits. Very sad what they both went through. I felt both Val and Robin during his tough times. I'm glad they ended up in a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 bill into this boy's hat !! And it was great that it was shot by Vancouver!
