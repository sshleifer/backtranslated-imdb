Udo Kier earned as much as nine dollars and got free food for it, so it's a victory in itself. More importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of rescuers walking through a demeter. I should warn you, I gunna bounce around this review real fast, making the clasp up. Pretty good. Coolio plays guy 187. 187 likes drugs. He finds a lot of coffins on board, and ... now I know nothing about the future, but maybe they're smuggling drugs in coffins. It's not a weapon that would be the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire gets out of its fog-filled coffin and then the real merriment begins. First, though this film has the word Dracula in that he is actually not in this film. But I have a theory. From the blue you can see that the rescue crew ship is leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was aboard with his retarded brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he would be back. Dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire in six or so minutes he was in the movie. The best part of this movie and for those of you who have seen it, you know what I'm saying is that after fathering it, he hugged everything. She has a huge monologue about ejaculation on different parts of Elaniak's erica and ... other cool things. Coolio, you really are the best EVER thing. Several other things are also happening in this movie. Like Casper Van Dean gets some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm, and then we lose the track for the FILM REDUCTION. And thank God really. We'll find that Erie's character is a police boot. As the film comes to an end, we find that the ship is on its way to the ram for the sun. A police shoe and one other survivor are doomed. Rather than avoid a certain death Erika police shoe reveals that she is also a slut of shoes and choose to mutually screw and die. Before they die in the sun, they die gratuitously, yes, that's true ... their ship doesn't throw any real reason. This film got an amazing rating for one reason, Coolio. My God, if they had black rappers for academic prizes, he'd be the first to win them. The only reason it didn't get a perfect ten is that there was no drop of nudity. Now I know what you think, how you can judge a movie, whether ladies show their goods or not. Well easy. Such a film requires it. Its part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of film final shock at the end. It's a formula. This had a blow, the monster was awesome because he was so intensely sucked that he did us a favor to stay out of the camera. That was considerate about him, and I respect that. Nudity, not a drop, although there was a long conversation about ... well seeing the above statement and regarding the shock / twist ... I definitely didn't see the end coming. That counts. I hope Hollywood doesn't think Coolio has given this film everything and has nothing. He deserves more work. Well, until Dracula 4000, I'm gone.
