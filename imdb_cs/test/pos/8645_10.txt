"Double Peaks" and "Blue Velvet" have always been two of my favorite movie works, and although past films have been a bit disappointing for me, it's always worth watching. to be humble, may be like good wine - it must be tasted and welded. But in the end you have to create your own opinion about what you have seen, because Lynch never gives you full answers. Many people leave the "Mulholland Drive" that wants to strangle the mind-bending visual puzzle that just unfolded before them. but there is a twisted logic to this film, you just have to look for clues. Betty (Naomi Watts) comes to Hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stars. She then finds Amnesiac in her bathroom who escaped from attempting murder on the Mulholland Disc. together they try to uncover the mystery behind the amnesian life. All this leads to a club called Silencio, where a blue box appears. and that is when the film throws everything out of the window. people we thought we knew were completely different people ... is it a dream? the reminiscence of previous life escapades? Either you love this movie or you hate it. David Lynch always pulls such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as its universe itself is always about extremes, it is appropriate that its films provoke such reactions. and we appreciate that lynch is a filmmaker who still lets you draw your own conclusions. he had many imitators as late, especially in the "vanilla sky", where the mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you probably forget that movie once you come out of the cinema. mulholland drive will haunt you.
