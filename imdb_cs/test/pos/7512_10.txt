This is one of the biggest films ever made. Brilliant playing by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This film is both disturbing and extremely deep. Don't be fooled to believe it's just comedy. It's a wonderful satire about the medical profession. It's not a nice picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend their time making money outside the hospital. And yet you really think it's a hospital. Producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This film really reveals how difficult it is to run a hospital and how bad things have been in 1971. I loved this movie. P.S. - I noticed that the incompetent dealer of the wheelwright was playing a leading firm in LA law. The young doctor played in Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse had appeared since she appeared in Becker and other exhibitions.
