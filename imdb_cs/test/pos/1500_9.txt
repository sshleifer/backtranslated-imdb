The three shorts contained in this 1959 compilation are timeless Chaplin's classics, nothing wrong with them, and nothing critical. Chaplin's score for these films and the frame added as bridges between the shorts are also well done. The problem with this compilation is smaller, but uncomfortable. Shorts were stretched to fit the frame 24 p.s. the speed of contemporary films due to the fact that shorts were shot at 20 p.s. These results are jerky movements that don't look too attractive, and yet it was an excusable solution due to the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it's not just excusable that the current version of the DVD is unlimited, the movies look dirty as they did in 1959 and they are still printed. There are separate restored versions of these classic versions, even on DVD, and there would be no problem restoring the image, but unfortunately it didn't. A minor argument has taken a lot of space in my article, but again I say a little quarrel, it shouldn't discourage it from experience, even if it made one point of my assessment difficult. Shorts are still worth '10'.
