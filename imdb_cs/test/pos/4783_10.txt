This was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent film called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton. In this early Mickey short, Mickey didn't even talk to he had gloves. He could only whistle and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the Straw" using several animal barnyard as musical instruments. He plays cow teeth like a xylophone and plays a nursing girl as an accordion keyboard. But Captain Pete is very crazy and makes Mickey peel potatoes in the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws half-peeled potatoes on the parrot and laughs, closing the cartoon. I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. I think Disney shorts are much better than feature-length movies.
