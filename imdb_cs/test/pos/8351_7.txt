* small spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know, it's like Walt Disney Television Animation can be just as well called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These sequels range from super ("Beauty and the Beast: Enchanted Christmas" and the fantastic "Lion King II: Simba's Pride") to the terrible ("Return of Jafar"). (This is of course my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. "Scamp is an adventure," and while it is defective, it is still fun. The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation; Yet the animators do well to bring the characters to life. Lady and Tramp still haven't been running since 1955. Trusts still talk about their sense of smell and "Ol" Reliable, and Jock still gives him grief. There is a nice fight between Tramp and the huge dog in the pound, and again we have a spaghetti dinner with two romantic clues (though it is very doubtful that it will become a classic scene as its predecessor). I don't really care about most of the songs (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan - the singing voices of Scamp and Angel - sing their parts very nicely). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a much better job in the past. Danny Troob's score is fine, but nothing memorable. And some of the robber gangs appear to be excess baggage; that is, they really don't do much. The voice of work, on the other hand, is pretty good. Although I don't like Jeff Bennett as a dogcatcher, he's very good as a Tramp. Chazz Palminteri is doing a good job as Buster, the gangster junkyard leader and Alyssa Milano giving what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his father). He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a great job of showing the wild stripe of Scamp and his soft side. All in all, while "Scamp's Adventure" is wrong, it's still more fun watching. However, I hope that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn its attention to more original material for their future release. <br /> <br />
