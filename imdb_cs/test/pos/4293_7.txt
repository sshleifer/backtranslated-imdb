Another popular projection of British painting at Coalville's Century Theater. A well-formed, solid drama with ever-evolving plot and continuing "twists in the story" ... how lies have accumulated! Masterclass of fictional cast, well ranked by first director Julian Fellowes. Excellent performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but the good turnovers of all involved, including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was this movie, which contains several shock incidents that really "jump" you. Good tight production in just 80 minutes, probably made on a very limited budget, but a success that Fellowes should see directing again on the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest that it was set in the 1950s (as according to Nigel Balchin's novel) but apparently this is not the case. Recommended browsing.
