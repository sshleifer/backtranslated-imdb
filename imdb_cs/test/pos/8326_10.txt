When Jurassic Park was first released, it was revolutionary in filming and special effects. For the first time when people were studying to go to a dinosaur movie and believed they were looking at real dinosaurs who were brought to life. what might be real creatures (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.), some of them have been changed to fit into the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film is currently on a tropical island where they weren't in their natural environment. . Walking with dinosaurs shows us real animals in their real habitats millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. Now we can see sights such as the gloomy Triassic Desert, the entire herd of Diplodocus, the Icthyosaur give birth, the MASSIVE Sea Monster, the pterosaurs eye-view, the thriving dinosaurs in the South Pole, two Torosaurus Lock Horns, T.Rex roaring at the camera and the impact of a comet that spelled their destruction. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, behave, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals other creatures they share in the world, with two episodes focusing mainly on two different animal species, the flying Pterosaurs and the sea reptiles that lived under the waves. Places and scenery are spectacular and look even more unique when CG Dino goes to the screen. And as far as CGI and animatronics are concerned, the CGI dinosaur movements look quite natural and natural, the color is clear and vivid, and the crew members have taken careful steps to ensure that CG animals will in any case work with their environment. by spraying water, brushing bushes, digging dust and throwing shadows on the ground. It is true that CG is not perfect with a few short cases where the animals look too computer, but the rest of the time looks breathtaking. Puppetry is in some cases poor, but it has its moments, especially the scene with Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's story is also very good, and it also gives us vital information and drama. Of course, the real pleasure is to see a live dinosaur doing what they did all these years, and also see some really cute moments with Cynodont (mammalian / reptilian hybrid) puppies, Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex cubs (Yes T .Rex can be cute and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and then even more.
