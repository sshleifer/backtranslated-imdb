When Ricci defeated them and went on a dead road near the Jacksons farm, he finds her and nurses her back to health. He believes it is a divine intervention that this topless white girl remains in his care. He clutched his Bible and prayed for guidance. She rejects her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something few men ever did in her life. Over time, he sees Jackson as a man of honor and morality, but he also carries his own pain. She plays guitar and sings it. Yes, it is also blues and damn well, with the minister who advised her, she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes he has to heal his own pain. Justin Timberlake returns, released due to "anxiety problems".
