Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but once in a while he can have a clinker. The beginning of this begins almost essentially with one character after another. You have Cary Elwe's charming and talented but can't do comedy. His camera expressions show that even he cannot believe inanities in the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted without doing anything, and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in high school acting. Dave Chapelle shows a great comedy range and swing for the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly suppressed as a blind man, but then he still manages to show a great comedy range. Eric Allen Kramer has little to do but a few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when they appear. Dom DeLuise has a humorous turn as Mafia Don, who employs Clint Eastwood's look, but on the downside some jokes aren't very funny, while some really funny seem stolen from Mel's movies.
