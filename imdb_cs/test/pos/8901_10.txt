After another raid in the empty village, the Vikings chief Timandahaf fails to understand the explanation of his Cryptograph adviser that "fear gives the inhabitants of the wing" and believes that fear actually causes the villagers to fly. They decide to pursue the master of fear in Gaul to learn to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, nephew Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, is sent from Paris to Gaul village to become a man, and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the young man. The silly son of Cryptograph, Olaf, listens to the conversation of the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Returning to Viking, Justforkix meets Abba, the daughter of Timandahaf, and falls in love with each other. But Machiavellian and the ambitious Cryptograph intend to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. Finally, Asterix realizes that it's not the fear that gives the wings, it's love. When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic and I read all the stories of Goscinna and Uderzo. This feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delicious and wonderful animation. Justforkix romance and gorgeous Abba are beautiful and Asterix and Obelix are cheerful. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Astérix and Vikings")
