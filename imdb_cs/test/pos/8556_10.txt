I have seen this movie maybe 100 times, never tired of it. It is a charming love story that brings most of the sun to the darkest times. I think it's a movie "must see" and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances at all. I just want TV channels to send this film more often. This inspired me in a good way and it will certainly do many more. If I wanted to meet an actor, it would be Anthony Quinn. It will never be like never on silver screens. He wished Anthony Quinn was still alive. God will bless his soul.
