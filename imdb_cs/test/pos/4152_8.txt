It is a film that is remarkable for what is not shown as what it is. What is shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily when the 19th century gave way to the 20th century, a lifestyle that dreamed of a "new" world in America. The Mancusa family lives in a place that is not even a village, just a stone cottage in the middle of the rough, clumsy stones of a country that cannot offer a single blade of green grass. The opening sequence sees Mancuso men blending barefoot up into a rocky hill, stones in their mouths offering at the shrine above in exchange for a 'sign' that they should head out to a new world or stay where they are. It further shows the life on board liners, huddled masses really, the desire to breathe free, and the conditions in Ellis Island, where their journey is not over, they are interrogated and investigated to prove their "fitness" to enter America. Longshot ships are not shown, or indeed ANY shots that would identify it as a large, oceanic ship; what is also not shown is something that would identify America, no clich√© view of New York Harbor and Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable shot is the camera crane, which looks at hundreds of people who are hit together; slowly, almost imperceptibly, two-thirds of the people on the left screen separate from the third on the screen and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship, and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of the company is fragmented. There is a strong documentary feeling as if we were watching a real ship full of immigrants, even though it was carefully written and is clearly a combination of typical families / conditions at that time. Almost nothing happens in dramatic terms, it's not for the multiplex popcorn brigade, but for the rest of us it's really a very fine film.
