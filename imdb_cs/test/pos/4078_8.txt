I totally hate the idea of ​​TV movies. For me, TVMs usually include Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who dies of a difficult-to-treat disease in such a way that the audience does not need the tissues it needs insulin. So when DEADLY VOYAGE made for the BBC and HBO TV movie based on a real story that I had vaguely remembered from a few years that appeared in television programs, I sat down and waited for myself to be boring. I was surprised. No punch that last sentence, I wasn't surprised that I was shocked. Here's TVM, which grabs you harder than the big white shark, in fact DEADLY VOYAGE doesn't deserve to be condemned to TV programs that should be made and distributed by a top Hollywood movie company due to its absolutely terrifying assumption and what? more is - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - absolutely true <br /> <br /> For those who don't know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AS A PLOT !!!!! sometime in the early 1990s, a group of Africans were hiding on a Ukrainian cargo ship to France to work there. Of course, this was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the cargo ship's crew was already fined for allowing illegal immigrants on their ship from their previous trip and not wanting to get into trouble with the maritime and immigration authorities. hiding in the holder. All but one African, Kingsley Ofus, who manages to escape from the firing unit, but who must try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting him and France is still a few days away. Just enter the above paragraph recalls how good DEADLY VOYAGE is. What is a remarkable story and again - unlike many stories that claim to be - absolutely true. It's very well written, directed and performed, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why isn't this guy a big star?), And most importantly, it's a tight claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I still remember six years after seeing it for just one time. I look forward to seeing you again. But you have to ask yourself how can TVM be better than most Hollywood action blockbusters that have appeared around the same time? Oh, hold on, I just had a worrying idea about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with director Tony Scott and with Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing Pertwee roles, a massive art license with events etc. VOYAGE is a more superlative TVM than a bad blockbuster
