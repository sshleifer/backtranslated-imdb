In the landscape after the battle, Andrzej Wajda in the second era of his film career, portrays the emotional and psychological confusion in the former Nazi prison in Poland, liberated immediately after World War II. The handheld camera explores many extreme details and vivid colors. The film ends as graffiti on the sides of trucks. The soundtrack is great, except for Vivaldi, who sounded in the pop art mode in the opening sequence.
