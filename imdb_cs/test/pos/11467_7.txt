PUBLIC NEEDS are a kind of return to the early 1960s gangster biographies, such as MOBSTER PORTRAIT, MAD DOG COLL, and BEAUTIFUL DOORS. Although the film was made on cheap, it has a lot of energy and the actor over-all, especially Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is pretty good. Theresa Russell might seem too charming as Ma, but she has a very good time. There are two action scenes worth mentioning: shoot-out at the hotel, and machine-gun combat in the middle of the street between Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are pretty done, and compared to other low-bidget junkies like DILLINGER and CAPONE, this movie is lit.
