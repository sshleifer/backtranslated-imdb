William Haines tells this story of a harsh cadet who thinks West Point will really be something he has come up with. Haines' amazing comic book performance was his trademark - one that made him a top box office star from 1928-1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also fine. And even though this story may seem trite now, it was a huge hit, putting Haines and Crawford in college football (national madness during the 20s) story. After Haines blows his big mouth once too often and almost avoids cadet colleagues, he turns in a wonderful performance when he swallows his pride and gets into a big game against the Navy. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and gains his place at West Point. It's easy to see from this movie and Show People (with always underrated Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a huge star of that time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
