I spent many years studying all the great directors like Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and I admire them very much. My favorite movie is Once Upon a Time in America. I recently became a fan of D'Amato, and while he wasn't a horror master, his movies were extreme, be it a soft core, hardcore or extreme. Porn Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, its shot is great and the music is catchy. Joe D'Amato wasn't a horror master, he is neither Fulci nor Bava, but although he was a master of eroticism, no other director could shoot erotic movies like him, he never tried to make any films outside these genres. Long Live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica!
