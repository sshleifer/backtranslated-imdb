All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this unforgettable thriller in the coming years. You've got a star cast - Michael Douglas in the atypical role of a "free spirit" that has largely launched his film career, Fonda playing her typical straightforward woman doing her piece for a ladies' libel, and Jack Lemmon, who assured us he always shows us man crisis of confidence. Give them a hot-button theme about big business's duplicitous, and it's encouraging for kickoff, but have a life imitating art so soon after it's a marketing dream of a man. The script is impressively tense, intelligent but mercifully keep the jargon to a minimum, and there is a real sense of lasting tension brought into play by the director as our three race protagonists beat the clock. If you like "whistles" then it's not as good as "Insider", but the whole thing is more than nervous.
