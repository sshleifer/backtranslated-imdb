I don't understand why critics would pass this film. It's a teen movie that is really serious, which is a rarity. I admit that there are moments that are extremely satisfied, but it's about young love, it must be happy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was funny in American Pie, he probably isn't ready to switch to a more dramatic fare yet, he is a very uncomfortable look in some of his "mom stuff". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and credibility, as well as a parent. Although the script is strongly clich√© with lovers who pour out of poetry, the actor does it. Directing sports some powerful images on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, I was amazed and I am a tired critic about teenage movies.
