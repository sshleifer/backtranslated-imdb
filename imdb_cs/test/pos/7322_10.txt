This is one particular Stooge short, which actually uses satire in connection with a slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short film was "borrowed" from the feature film of the same year with Clark Gable "Men in White". It is basically about the trials and tribulations of the trainees and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity." I recently saw it and almost treated it as a Stooge because it is taken too seriously. In any case, "Men in Black" is so well written, directed, and not to mention the original, and Chaplan and others were not interested in anything that was suggested by the Film Academy for Best Short Film. a 1934 comedy. Some stinking short called "La Cucaracha" overcame it though and stole the prize. Some producer's brother in law had to be on the College's ballot board. "Men in Black" put fun on the whole concept of the medical profession as well as Marx Bros. It must not be a fair comparison, but I see Marx Bros in this short. In fact, in their function "Day at the Races", there is a scene where there is "medical stuff" going on and they cause anarchy as usual. I think that this short short duel was judged by these rules and was therefore nominated first. Try it in reality: watch this short first and then watch "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with Marxes and then see if there is the same quality comedy.
