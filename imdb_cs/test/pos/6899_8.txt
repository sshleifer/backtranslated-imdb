I saw it at an independent San Francisco film festival and I liked it a lot. It worked like a little weird comedy for me because I don't like the horror, but I had to close my eyes for a few minutes. The dialogue was good, the costumes and settings weren't far BBC-quality, which is amazing for an independent movie. I liked how the plot conspiracy and even the meanders, it surprised me in a good way. I even warmed up to the character of Willy Grimm, whom I hated quite at the beginning. It would be better if there was any motivation for the woman to be so interested in the island: it was very similar to a conspiracy device. I like Dominic Monaghan and did a good job in pratfalls, horror, and more thoughtful moments. Nice voice in the story, too. This would be a fun and unusual movie date.
