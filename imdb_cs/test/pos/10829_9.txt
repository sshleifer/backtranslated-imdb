Jean-Pierre Rappenau, director and author, was 8 years old in the spring of 1940 when France fell apart during the third week. It was time, he says, when "all adults were a little crazy." He and the factory workers lovingly and carefully restored this world in film, where all the characters are basically fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for a period when several lines of a zipper plot intersect to merge into a logical, satisfying conclusion. The pin for this conspiracy is Frederic, played by the brilliant novice Gregory Derangere, who is fully playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real power of the film is in its supportive performance. Rappeneau cast the film great with actors who volunteered for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. Although not as widely influential as Renoir's 'game rules,' 'Bon Voyage' richly deserves to be a companion piece to this classic. Although it requires a lot of viewers, it gives a lot back. One of his demands is tolerance to a certain coyness and misdirection when it comes to the exact genre we follow: crime melodrama, no, spy thriller, ah, romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemafile friends. Just make sure you let them discover for yourself that it's a romantic comedy.
