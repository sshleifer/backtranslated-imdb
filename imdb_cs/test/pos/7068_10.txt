Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one for food, one for breathing and another for s ** ting ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who like the brain ... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there for every purpose, every detail, a coffee mug, a red couch, everything ... is an underestimated masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> It's fun, it's raw and absolutely realistic, that's how we communicate ... it's a royal comedy ... total causality ... <br /> <br /> Just say, don't let the first scene shock you ... hang ... and enjoy the show.
