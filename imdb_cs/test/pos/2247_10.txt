When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a terrible commotion, directed by director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and completely changed my mind. Based on Jonathan Safran's novel Foer, everything is illuminated telling the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) trying to find a woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He travels to Germany and with the help of something 20 years he teaches a club that intervenes with translators and his grandfather. The result is a rigid search across the country and are determined to find what they are looking for. Shot in one of the most beautiful landscapes of the world, everything that is lit brings the tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help Jonathan needs to find his quarry. There are many religious issues because grandfather refers to Jonathan as "Jew". All in all, it is a film that deals with finding yourself and a loving family. I give this wonderful, if not illuminated, movie of 10 out of 10. Arjun
