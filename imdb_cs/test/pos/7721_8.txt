For the first time in the movie, I think they did a great job! We must support the emerging industry, which comes mainly from the north. It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and lots of laughter. It's a good movie and so I felt when I came out of the cinema! He has northern humor and positively evaluates the community he represents. The film has just opened, I hope it will happen - people should support this little movie. I think this "guilty ..." is very bitter, about something! And still too personal ??? shame!! I say well done to all involved? I look forward to seeing you next business.
