I have no words to really describe this series. A prerequisite for this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality that ends up developing a oddball team into her own creation of the world) who ultimately was Haruhi's creation because she wants the world with extraterrestrials, espers, and Travelers in Time) is the breath of fresh air in the world with repeated anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> Characters are well developed and end up loving with them, some less than others. The word describing the animation task does not exist because "excellent" would not really be enough to describe how it was done. There are many funny situations that will either make you smile or take you into deep thoughts. They do not fall into the impression of the first episode because it is just the tip of the iceberg because the novels are yet to come. The only problem is the lack of chronological order of the episode, but you can solve this problem, right? Conclusion: No doubt one of the best series of 2006.
