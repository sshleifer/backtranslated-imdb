It was such a great series for blacks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about black families at t.v. in time, when. Please release it on DVD. I know many ... many people who are still talking about the show. If it's released, I'm sure many of the black youth will find it instructive and interesting. The show dealt with many topics ranging from racism, in-house discrimination, teenage pregnancy, sibling rivalry, united parenthood, peer pressure and much more. The show ended up in such a sudden journey and left the infant fans wondering why it was taken out of the air. Since then we have seen only a few actors and actresses. Please release it to DVD ASAP.
