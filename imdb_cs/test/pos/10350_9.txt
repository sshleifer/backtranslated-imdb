I'm so glad I recorded this movie when it came to the BBC last month! It hit my head, making the intestinal fragile and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in that, although his character is not always so easy to identify with. The last scene where he plays the song broke my heart, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I think he made this movie between Dr. Who, and that's even more success for me. I just love Dr. Who, and yet I saw nothing in it, as Mr. Tennants of this man who knows that he has changed and tries to create a new identity and life. intense drama!
