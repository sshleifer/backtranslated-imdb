Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is just killing time to get a job. Her real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay so long and fall in love too easily, a dangerous combo. Greg (Suzy Parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. All three are condemned to dramatic dramaturgy at The Best of Everything, a 1959 playroom / morale / sometimes a solid film that gets older. Set in the cut-throat world of paperback publishing, its not as bad as "Valley of the Dolls", but not as vanilla as "Three Coins in the Fountain." The mixed men - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, and Robert Evans - are largely neat, well dressed and without good. Aherne is a resident sexual offender - he will step on anything that goes and make unwanted advances to the right and left. His character is offensive as hell, but he doesn't play at all. Harassment has not yet been discovered, I think. Boyd also works there, though you never see him. He's too busy being older, wiser, and drunk. Evans is just abroad that Diane Baker can suffer in style - he's a rich guy who got her into "trouble", so instead of marrying her as promised, he takes her for "surgery." Jourdan is a director who is wrong with Parker. They share a battle scene that is quite not-keeping wasted, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is eventually destroyed by Parker's historronics. She ends up almost chasing him, and she really didn't deserve such a miserable fate, her bad deal no matter what. Joan Crawford breathes fire like Amanda Farrow, a resident 'witch' who is automatically rude and rejects any of her legions of secretaries. Well, they're younger, aren't they? Isn't that enough reason to hate man? Caroline doesn't think so. Crawford only relaxes once he tells his married friend that you can go to hell with your rabbit wife and slam the phone. You will never see a poor soul who dares to cross her. The story of Martha Hyer, as it was, is extremely weak, and she is painfully exaggerated as a single mother. Briefly wearing a huge "W" (for 'slut') on her sweater, she walks around like a pathetic mess most of the time of her screen. Worse still, there is no courtesy, it would "tie" it all the way, at the end. It doesn't matter that much, but still .. <br /> <br /> His painfully obvious, all this was taking place in a completely different world. People were for the most part nicer and work was not a move, but something exciting for a girl from outside NYC as well. One unconvincing drunken scene aside, Hope Lange helps make it seem real, Caroline, who has more than one side of her character. I admire women's opinion, chance and choice. Not that it wasn't wrapped in a nice bow, but it makes points for equality. In 1959, it was probably remarkable and perhaps controversial. 7/10.
