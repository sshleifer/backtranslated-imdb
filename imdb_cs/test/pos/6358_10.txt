I was very impressed with this movie by Dir./Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was excellent. "Jorge Cordoba" made a powerful <br /> <br /> and shocking performance as the main character "Rafa". It is inspiring to see independent movies with this level of talent. It takes talent, courage and determination to go out and make a quality film. <br /> <br /> I admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to concept and go miles. It is easy for people to judge younger filmmakers harder, but I applaud Jose Reyes <br /> <br /> and the talented cast for their successful efforts.
