A group of cats trying to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy valet. Aristocats is considered one of Walt Disney's finest 2D animations with its charming script and great characters, but that doesn't mean. Don't quite have the spell that created Snow White or Jungle Books. Slow opening will have younger audiences raising eyebrows, but once cats have established themselves in the story, fun and fun to start. Young cats create the most pleasant pleasure with a charming young rivalry with which a special kind of bond of any brother or sister of any age can come together. It's not the funniest Disney picture out there, but there are some great comic moments, especially involving cats and dogs. Gangster cat representations are very impressive and just as fun. The story, after a boring start, is always fun and exactly what a family movie should be. There are hardly any downtime and no boring moments. The journey to home is interesting and you get a sense of discovery, not to mention two very strange British swans. With Disney, you always have a strong, meaningful message. With Jungle Book you are where you belong with beauty and beast that you explore the importance of inner beauty. However, with this picture of 1970, something seems to be missing. The film has meaning and meaning at home, but it is not sufficiently cemented; it seems very attractive and irrelevant. My sister and I found it very strange to watch how some of the central characters were expressed in the Jungle Book. Despite the bad start and confusion of his preaching message, it is constantly a fun family movie with good music scores and some cool crazy characters that viewers at any age can relate to.
