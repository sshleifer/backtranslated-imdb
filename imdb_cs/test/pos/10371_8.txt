I saw this film last weekend on A&E. The secret was fine, I wasn't able to guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than mystery. Some of them were mysterious, especially George Abernathie, performed by the amazing Michael Fassbender, and George's cousin Susannah. In fact, the story of these two characters let me want to know more. From what I was trying to lure about the book of Agatha Christie of the same title, I think he did not follow this letter. Very good performances of the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Coru / companion.
