This is one of those movies that for some reason just clicked with me. Everything is right. Eric Roberts laconic, a handsome investigator, his voice narration, convoluted plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb have given good roles, settings, art studio paintings, a final credit sequence and beautifully scary thematic music that perfectly captures the mood of the film. If I have any reservations, it's about Beverly D'Angelo as a femme fatale, but it beautifully plays its last scenes. I think director Matthew Chapman tried to make the whole thing chinatown feel. That didn't work. But as a murder-secret, it's a gem.
