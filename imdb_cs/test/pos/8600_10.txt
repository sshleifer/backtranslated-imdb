In light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (ie, Tajfun Ondoy), I thought I was looking at myself again at "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), at the creepy black and white masterpiece of Shohei Imamura on the destruction and consequences of atomic bombs that hit Hiroshima in the final period of World War II. The destruction and impact of both disasters (war and typhoon) may vary in degree and quality, but trauma and scar (both physically and psychologically) are still there. It is a testament to the strength of the film that its images remain as strong and indelible as when they were first seen. It's just that the difference in my case is that observing these images has brought a greater sense of honesty and strength through first-hand experience with almost monumental weather. Such is the sense of kinship. Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: "Pornographers: An Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Hot Water Under the Red Bridge" (2001), his two Palme d'Or winners "Balada Narayama" (1983) and "Eels" (1997) to name some. Given the mood of his films, who thought he once served as an assistant director at Yasujiro Ozu, the most strict and minimalist filmmakers of Japanese cinema? But then it is Ozu's strict formality and home page against which Imamura rebelled. But again, with "Black Rain" you can clearly feel the impressions of Oz. A father (or father-figure) who intends to see his daughter get married before time runs out, and the tranquility and tranquility of scenes depicting all family members together (especially for dinner or Oz film lexicon, tatami) is something a revered master of the filmmaker would have been exploring in his works all the time ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). Basically, all the subdued and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is a remarkable contrast to the Bacchanalian chaos and the instinctive temptation of the entire Imamura filmography. However, this does not mean that the film should not be truly disturbing. "Black Rain", as American film reviewer Leonard Maltin has aptly described, is "filled with scary black and white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura does not open any blows to show the immediate and graphic horrors of nuclear bombing, one by one (stiff fired bodies, hanging meat, walking dead, fires and debris everywhere, madness everywhere). Attacking the audience's senses, surely it is, along with the dark b / w Takashi Kawamata photography (he made the lens in Yoshitar Nomura's criminal drama "Incident") and Toru Takemitsu's freezing score (he made music in such classics as Akira Kurosawa's "Ran "And Masahiro Shinoda is a" double suicide ". <br /> <br /> Even during the supposed" tranquil "phase of the film (ie, five years after atomic bombing), one can never feel contented and satisfied, with restlessness and pain they are still strongly felt, survivors, not only in terms of physical health failure, but rather in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma, and the human race, which is now undoubtedly revealed, has been destined to carry the Bomb heritage as long as it lives. A few years earlier I wrote a piece about "Black Rain" (published on IMDb.com), but only compared to the amazing "Tin Drum" by Volker Schlondorff, he gave FIRST monumental film project dealing with human folly. global catastrophe. Furthermore never been my practice to write twice about the film, which I had to write something. It is in the light of the recent weather calamity that has ravaged our country, that I have been encouraged to visit again and write something about this remarkable film, Imamura, because there are many lessons to be learned from the film and recent events. in terms of imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and behavior, and long-term scars and wounds caused by extensive destruction (whether caused by man or nature). There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "The War Game", each located in their own countries), and "Black Rain" between them if not more, for both their unintentional and grim depiction of individual and communal disintegration caused by atomic devastation and the fact that it has its historical event as its foundation. A few weeks since then, another movie about the Hollywood disaster, Roland Emmerich's "2012", will finally be hit (no pun intended) big screen. As we all know, this American director's "catastrophic / apocalypse" films - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "Day after Tomorrow" - have no other purpose than to be merely an amusing value, without a real understanding of the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic catastrophe and affected human condition. I wonder how this "huge" movie would use trauma, disorientation and fears that our people still experience due to the recent weather calamity. To say that this film is a preventive story would probably be nothing more than an overstatement. But yes, I will still watch "2012".
