A captivating story behind the curtains. The film follows the situation of David Letterman and Jay Len who are fighting for the elusive Spot Show Show. Letterman led his longing for a long time slot, and Leno led his agent and little devil on his shoulder, Helena Kushnick. Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienated herself from such top dogs as Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. At the end of the film, you are so excited about how you manage every situation from guest bookings to delayed recording that you will appreciate when you want more. John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays a role on the tee. Occasionally I found myself wondering if there was any relationship to real Letterman. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all those interested in entertainment or the world of corporate meetings.
