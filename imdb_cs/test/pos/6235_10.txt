Let me start by saying that the Tourist Trap is a better film than the 99.9% of horror movies that have recently been released from Hollywood. If you don't believe me, look at Darkness Falls or They. And it's definitely better than any of the miserable ones right on video tapes like Stab, Bleed, The Pool and so on. One of the biggest problems with the movie The Tourist Trap is that there was never an audience. When the film opened in 1979, the MPAA received a PG rating. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that PG on horror film is usually a kiss of the movie's death. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on a DVD commentary.) There are exceptions, such as Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are great differences between the tourist trap and the poltergeist. The Tourist Trap was not a big budget for a Hollywood movie like Poltergeist nor was it made by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to make Poltergeist successful. (Still for those of you who have seen a tourist trap, you will even scratch your head when it comes to why MPAA this PG movie. How is it with a pipe in your back with the fact that it is flowing blood.) I was young, I looked at a copy of the Poltergeist in the shelf of a video store, picked it up, saw it was rated PG and instead put it back on the shelf in favor of an R-rated movie. what a great movie I missed for not borrowing a PG horror movie. Since then, I would never rate a film based on his rating. This is most likely what happened to the tourist trap. People, like me with the Poltergeist, are likely to overlook this in favor of an R-rated movie. Most likely, it would be a teenager that most of these films focus on. Friday the 13th was not a masterpiece either, but he did very well at the box office due to the fact that he was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at that time. It found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. When you look at it, the tourists Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same could happen with the tourist trap. We could see Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As far as the film is concerned, the Tourist Trap is a fun horror movie, created on a very small budget, but well-functioning, well-managed and well-developed at many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot like Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance in the movie. Special mention must be given by composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film is really what distinguishes him from the others and gives him his haunting. Music in scenes involving dummies is especially fearsome. Donaggio has worked on the horror movie Carrie and many other movie parts from the Tourist Trap. He has done an extremely good job in the film and continues to watch movies to this day. Weakness with the tourist trap is that there is never an explanation of Davey's powers. Maybe it is. It just has them and we should accept it for the film to work. We accept it to a certain extent, but then the scenario has incidents like Davey's calling in the store when he's in the basement. In that case, is Davey limited to using his powers? Can she ring the phone in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its scope? These are the things that people who did not care about this film would most likely point to shortcomings. Others would consider it a mistake. I accept it. These types of questions that this film creates are not enough to hate it. It's a horror movie. We should not be obliged to read too much about it. Many people called it the movie "killer". I assure you that no mannequin will kill anyone in this movie. The dummies are controlled by the power of Davey, who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this film. Some people have a problem with dummies and some have even said that they are just downright dumb. I think they contribute to the overall film creep. The overall hiking trail is good fun. *** (of 5)
