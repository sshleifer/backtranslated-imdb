36th HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) The Manhattan Hospital has taken a number of incidents. Patients die left and right due to overcrowded conditions and inability of staff. When a resident physician is caught in the number of deaths, the chief physician, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott) is invited to investigate. Dr. Bock, who has worked for many years as a doctor and has undergone his own crisis situation, finds it difficult. She decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), the beauty of a young hippie. Who is an enthusiastic look at life, helps depressed Bock. Criticism: The Black Comedy is a tour-de-force performance by veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing serious characters whose strict morality is strictly tested. The first half of the film develops as melodrama, which gives a pretty good overview of life in the hospital and how it sometimes occurs. But then, as things look at the dramatic climax, it turns into a grotesque comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky kept his dramatic feeling, I wonder if Scott would go out with another best actor, Oscar (before he won, 'in-absentia', a year ago). His failure (suicide) scene is one of the most serious facts in cinema history. QUESTION: Dr. Bock: "â€¦ in the evening I was sitting in my hotel room looking at my wreckage I said" no Bock will do it. You are a doctor, a healer, you are a necessary person, you are a life meaningful ".
