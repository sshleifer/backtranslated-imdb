Yes, it's Sean Connery, who plays Bond again, looks more vivid than ever before when they first made this film, in 1965 when it was called "Thunderball." But the language is so tight that Connery does not use a few of the tricks he observes from his friend and humorous successor, Roger Moore. Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery is strong for this unusual trip. The only serious Bond movie that was not produced under the auspices of the classic Eon Bond series, "Never Say Never Again" is a return to the well. Soft on action, however, is strong on character and clever dialogue. Bond, it's clear right now, he's a man in misfortune. No matter how many times he saved the world, his new boss thinks his lifestyle is little. "Too many free radicals is your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "Then I cut out the white bread, sir," Bond replied gracefully. <br /> <br /> The early bathing order is the ultimate action movie of the film, with Bond and the attacker fighting them. the kitchen, the bedroom and the lab before Bond finally strikes his opponent, ironically without the little help of these free radicals. Humor is applied in the film rather skilfully than most of Moore's trips, though Connery seems to be more entertaining as he sent himself up as a result of Moore's less egotistical example. Was it because he was making a good piece of rude? Or did it work for less demanding manufacturers? Whatever it is, the script will serve its style well and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's earlier two Eon Bond tours, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever". The eighties were not a good decade for Bond whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games, and ugly sports cars are fine, and Bianca Jagger's sunglasses Klaus Maria Brandauer are wearing them in his first scene to not trust him. Forget the first view. Brandauer's role as a major villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond movie, with Brandauer pleasantly playing up his character's threat and mania. At one point, he allows Bond free to roam his sit room, with a martini to the shoe, and his dance eyes and a mad, engaging smile to make for a compelling company throughout the world. best thing in this movie, Other than Connery, are Bond girls, they shot more attention to personality than usual in Bond films, testimony of cameraman Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera has been nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Fatima Blush villagers, every bit as crazy as Largo and even nicer to watch. It won't last the whole movie; You almost need it away to focus on others. Breast and Kim Basinger's ass were supposed to have their own agents on the screen to get into this movie, but I don't complain. Basinger is a rare beauty who in this early role, as Largo's mistress mixes incredible Hotitude with the child's vulnerability that brings Bond in me, and many more I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are also very sweet.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well-built movie. It's a knockoff of a better Bond movie with a sloppy story, a terrible score and a flat end. But he's got Connery, which proves he was definitive when it comes to a definitive secret agent, even if he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is pretty fun, so I'm not complaining.
