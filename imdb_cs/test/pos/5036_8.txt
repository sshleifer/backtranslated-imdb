This is one of my favorite "Capra-esque" comedies. This film is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. It's not a religious commentary. It is fun. It's a fantasy. Surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect the level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think that they must be part of every movie. Others have described the role of Travolta (that's why you'll watch the movie over and over again) and excellent casting support (including Sparky!). Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes the movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
