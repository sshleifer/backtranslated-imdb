In the midst of his parents' documentary, the creator's mother dies, but continues to create the document and discovers a story that he did not foresee. The result is an immersive drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense, where the sympathetic but unconscious narrator unwittingly favors the audience. The story thus has a double bond, the story of a documentary film and the story of a documentarist. Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for haunting his story, even though he risks his whole concept. the relationship of parents, but also because they never gave up the sensation or melodrama. Though Hollywood stuff is featured in the details, Doug Block deals with the story the way everyday life would do. For those of us who have always been interested in our parents' lives before we came to the scene (or after we arrived, but when we were too self-conscious to notice that they had a life independent of each other), 51 Birch Street gives a fair warning There are amazing things out there in the homeland, but be careful if you choose to enter there. But this caution is for the audience to go slowly wandering in the details of their parents' past. It is not a warning for those who have offered insight into the life of block parents. The film is a miracle in that the mother comes alive as a living and passionate but introspective person who makes her own conscious decision in the 1950s. The creator's special achievement is that viewers actually see a young woman behind an older parent and grandparent. We all know that our parents were once young and energetic, but at 51 Birch Street she is a mother. The father who was distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up eventually remains remote in the film, but it is more due to his own elusive nature than to his portrayal. This biography transformed the autobiography into a dramatic, intense and unforgettable one, surely sending viewers closer to their own family albums, but rather hesitating to see the back of these photos.
