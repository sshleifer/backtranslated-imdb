I came out of the "Rendition" with a list of defects a mile long, so how come it is that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie? It is definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts. These parts include casting star stars, not one of them giving unforgettable performance (Omar Metwally, relative unknown, is the one you remember it; operable if it is indistinguishable; and the scenario that is at the same time Meanwhile, an American citizen born in Egypt, who is kidnapped by the US government program for publishing, otherwise known as the process by which America is torturing suspicious terrorists to acknowledge whether it is true at a distance. a pregnant woman calling for a college friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps watch her husband Meryl Streep plays a publishing program manager; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned for questioning and whose Meanwhile, the whole parallel story of the tip of the daughter follows an Egyptian official who is associated with an American publishing program and her boyfriend who is in training to become a suicide bomber. Ay-yi-yi is a lot of conspiracy to wrap in a two-hour movie and I wanted to wash my hands, especially the Romeo and Juliet of Egypt, which felt like nothing more than a distraction. But then near the final of the film, the twist chronology brings all the elements of the mesh together in a way that makes you want to rethink everything you thought you knew about the motivation of different characters, and makes the "Rendition" a more interesting movie than it seems to be going to be . Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard look like high school students playing twenty years older than in reality - especially Gyllenhaal, usually a great actor, looks so bored that you're wondering if he's going to gather energy, to add his lines. And the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as Meryl Streep has and giving her no more than working with this one-dimensional dragon lady. Of course, the film seeks relevance, but instead of dealing with a complex network of arguments about national security, it is billed directly in the middle of a debate in a predictable way. There are times when you think the film will be reflected in an interesting direction - what if Forerspoon, for example, began to doubt his husband's past? What if Metwally was actually in contact with terrorists, as his investigators blame? But no, the film has the path of least resistance. But as I said at the beginning, I recommend this movie. I know I didn't do anything, but she wrote a lot of his mistakes, but she has her head in the right place and is fun, or at least as fun as a movie about torture and interrogation can be. <br /> <br /> Stage: B +
