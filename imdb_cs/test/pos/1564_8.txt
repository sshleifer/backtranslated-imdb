Great Performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled on this movie while browsing my satellite lists and was curious about the summary of the chart provided by my satellite service provider. I was very entertaining and had a great sympathy for the character "Alice" played by Emily Grace. The story argued over what would happen to Alice and it wasn't predictable. The overall story was refreshing and the backing characters had several twists. The end of the story ended fairly fairly. I'll buy this DVD and add it to my library. I'm a new Emily Grace fan and I expect to see more of her performances.
