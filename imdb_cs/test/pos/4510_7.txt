In the 70s in Afghanistan, Pushtun boy Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and Hazara boy Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), who is his faithful friend and son of their servant Hazara Ali (Nabi Tanha), are raised together in Amir's father's house, play and sit on the streets of peaceful Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) accuses him of his mother's death at birth, and that his father loves and prefers Hassam. In return, Amir feels great respect for his best friend Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir won the kitting competition, Hassam runs to bring the dragon to Amir, but is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) in the empty street to protect the Amir of the dragon; Coward Amir witnesses the attack, but does not help loyal Hassam. The day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to build the boy as a thief, and forced his father to fire Ali, loosen his conscience, and remember his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates from a public college for pride and joy by Baba. Later, Amir meets his compatriot Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they marry. In 2000, after the death of Baby, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from terminal Rahim Khan, who reveals the secret of his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, in Pakistan, in the way of redemption. I am not familiar with Afghan culture and I have not read this novel despite my daughter's recommendation and I decided to watch this movie on DVD yesterday. I found a good story about loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight into the recent history of Afghanistan, from the calm period of the 1970s to the present day with the Taliban. Actors and actresses have great performances, giving a realistic story credibility. Arid places in China resemble the images we see on television from Afghanistan. Finally, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
