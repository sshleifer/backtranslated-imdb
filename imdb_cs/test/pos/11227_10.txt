Hypnotic Michael The Polish "Northfork" is a film that has long been remembered. This superbly created film, written by Michael and Mark Polish, is visually one of the best things that came out of the world of independent films last year. The picture is beautifully photographed by M. David Mullen, who has the scary score of Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading. > The idea of ​​setting up a movie in Montana was a big coup for the Polish brothers. The majestic views of the countryside and the mountains have never been so vividly captured as in "Northfork". We don't need any color! Beauty is in the dark tones of the film, which increases the story of doom in this remote base. In the center of the story is Irwin, a sick child under the care of mysterious father Harlan. . This boy is seen in his bed, where the priest administers a cure for his body. But is it really there? We watch him communicate with a strange group we meet in the cemetery for the first time. There are two freshly opened graves. Will one of them be for Irwin? Simultaneously with this first theme, there are other rendering lines in parallel. We see six men in black who came to this area to remove as many people as possible from the area. This will be a bed for a man-made lake to be created. Their reward is one acre and half a lake front property if they move a certain amount of people. The third story line focuses on a mystical group composed of Hercules flowers, a cup of tea, cod and happy. They follow the possibility of joining an angel who has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets them in the graveyard, he only offers him help if they leave him at least a thousand kilometers away. We watch the quartet examine the feathers that the boy placed between the pages of his Bible. Could Irwin be the angel? The final sequence shows us all the sides that leave Northfork in different directions. The men in black rode their cars, perhaps returning home and enjoying the newly acquired properties that were given to them as a reward. The mystic group is seen boarding the plane and taking off to a higher place. We also realize that his child died in Father Harlan, despite the medication and care he received from the holy figure. Michael Polish got one of the best bodies of all principles. Nick Nolte, when Father Harlan transforms low performance in his portrayal of this kind man. James Woods, like Walter, one of the men who works for the developer, is doing a great job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes a great impression like Irwin. This child actor, with the right guidance, shows a great promise. The Mystic Band is superbly bred by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, a man with funny glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under the direction of Poland. The beauty of film lies in its simplicity. Mr. Poland's vision will haunt memory. The paintings of Montana, perhaps a surreal landscape, are one of the best things about American movies.
