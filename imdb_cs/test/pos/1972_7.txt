The eXistenZ movie is about a futuristic video game on the "under" system that is almost like a virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when the assassination attempt is made by the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). If it can't be repaired, many years and 38 million dollars spent on development will go to waste. The only way to fix the game is to go into the game with the only person he feels he can trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but it's not too late in the movie. The best in this movie were twists to the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10
