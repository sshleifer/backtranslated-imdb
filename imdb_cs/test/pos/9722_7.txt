Despite their pedigree, the most interesting ones on this series are neither animatronics nor puppetry, which are charming but are more than just a party, at least in the story I have seen. In fact, hate, even if I admit it, the program's main pleasure lies in the oldest art narrative. John Hurt, in Rowley Birken QC mode, grotesque, medieval make-up, refers to a story telling story settled by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. One winter day, hungry and poor, he notices a beggar thrown out of the Royal Kitchen by an ugly chef. Story Story Teller tricks this trick to give them an excellent soup. Furious, Cook pleaded with the King for permission to cook the villain, but, content with the story of Teller's joke, the monarch offers him a reprieve - for 100 nights, he must tell King a new story: if he fails to do so. , he gives it to the cook. The story may be old, but it is said with great taste. Anthony Minghelly's screenplay is super dramatic (as it is to the playwright), humorous and with some worrying fears of entertainment, such as the fear of oneself, or the culturally self-sustaining power of narration associated with the continuation of ideological power. For a child-centered program, it is tremendously self-reflective (with a little nonsense about film is a new oral culture); despite the Americanized style, it is a charming sense of medieval bustle, its grotesque and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.
