I barely remember what DECADE I saw this movie. That was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid-1980s and so much of it has remained with me ever since. When I saw other comments, I had no idea that it was seen in theaters, or that there was someone else, even a new one. I don't think I ever mentioned that movie to anyone else. But halfway later, I still remember a lot of the movie I saw late at night. I think the innocence of the characters, their situation, their long-standing affection, left a long-term imprint on the reasons I don't understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager at the time I saw it and it somehow touched me ..... I don't really know! I also wanted to know what happens when the movie ends. Oh, suffering! I haven't seen him yet, or since then, but I'd love to. I keep looking at it, but now I doubt it will be shown, and it seems to have disappeared into oblivion. But I would miss the TV guide even if the DID appears. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading reviews restored my interest here. If anyone knows about its availability in Australia, write me in all ways and let me know. Oh, and Sean Bury ... glad to see these comments. I looked at the film's history and noticed your last appearance in the James Bond movie. What are you up to date? And you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS!!!
