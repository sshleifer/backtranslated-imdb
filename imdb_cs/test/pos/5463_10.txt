as a former television editor, I can say that it is as authentic as possible. This even led to Letterman's producer (thinking he was the source) resigning (ultimately) in real life. Letterman was outraged (OK, so one wacky thing is to throw softballs on a tire swing on his farm; total production), but the main information is genuinely true, from the stupid offer of Letterman's war once he decided to leave NBC on Leno's problems with an agent who was not ready for the big time but who had run the show (almost to the disastrous exit) of his famous loyalty. If any of you don't understand why Letterman is jealous today, look at this tape.
