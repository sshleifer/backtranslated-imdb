I love this movie. is it in the air? what can i do to get it again in the air because i miss this movie when it movie air again? I love this movie so much. Does anyone know how long it was because it was the last time on Disney? It was a very long time and I'm so sick of waiting! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear they take all the good movies out of the air and play new silly gays that are fake and retarded. I miss this movie, I wish you a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil and a lot more. where did all the good movies go? I want them back.i miss all the good movies and don't have them anymore. If someone finds out if Susie Q or some good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no gap) 148. Thank you and hope you want this movie too. Have a nice day
