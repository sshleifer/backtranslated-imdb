Hi, I never took the Manga comics eyes, but this movie is probably based on one. All right, that's life. Anyway, it's a pretty bizarre, at least movie, thing in a small Japanese city literally out of control. People become obsessed with uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches as her friend's father videotape snail, and later in the movie, people begin to become snails? It also seems that this boy is so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in household appliances. There is some bizarre humor that might be at home in the movie Tim Burton, but there is some ugliness and gore like just Japanese can do with justice. As with many Japanese movies, after all, has something been solved? Well, not in my opinion. There are some hints why this is all happening, but they are not explored and there is a lot left with either imagination or otherwise it was not considered important. Yet there are a lot of things you can look at, and if you're not obsessed with everything that makes perfect sense, it's easy to see because it's so original and bizarre. My favorite was my father with rotating eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
