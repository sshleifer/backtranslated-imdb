Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It's indifferent ... it's where it's waiting for you to do one." These words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best summary of the nature of the ocean I have ever heard confused. His furie is boundless, not least her loneliness. These words come from the fascinating and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor, who participated in the Sunday Times race in 1969 around the world. If you don't know his story, it may be best to stop reading. Do not read these or other information about Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and just watch it. After the first solo encirclement of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and adventurers began to look for another one-up. This time the road would have to be made without landing or stopping along the way. After falling for hard times, Crowhurst saw the race as a great chance to get his family back on his feet. As a child, he experienced financial difficulties and wanted to return to such a life. So he decided to find sponsors and soon did it in Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. Both men introduced a potential cow and awarded a ship to Crowhurst, provided that if he were to get out of the race he would have to pay the costs. However, his ship had a serious need for repair and was afraid he would not be ready for the last day of departure. But he was informed by his sponsor that he just had to go? After all, they plunged into the dough and expected to return it many times. The story details are infamous: Crowhurst's boat has begun to pick up water and its progress has slowed down to crawl. Faced with the decision to try to bypass the corner of Africa (some death in such a ship) or to return (financial devastation and misery), he sought a third option. He decided to hide himself on his yacht and waited for other competitors to bypass Cape Horn in South America. From there he returns to the race. He reported false positions and recorded a break rate. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be dealt. He also had to carefully design false log books for every day of the journey he didn't take. In the end, loneliness, guilt, and the awareness that he was probably caught, were seriously appreciated by Crowhurst. His final log entries seem perfectly reasonable. Just a few weeks from home, he turned his ship away from home, and is reported to have jumped overboard soon afterwards. Crowhurst's Odyssey is fascinating and its end is heartbreaking, but strikes inevitable. Our dreams are so often transformed into fear, and the consequences of our actions often leave so few choices for a happy ending. It is the story of a descent into madness that has conquered the endless abyss of cruel seas. The creators do a great job in telling this story. It's along with the freezing audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst and telling his ever-growing diaries. The story begins slowly and can distract some viewers, but the story's rewards are quite useful as it progresses. There are also questions to some of the other competitors like Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who was on par to probably win the speed competition, just pull out and start a second trip around the world. Also in the movie is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> To read briefly about the Crowhurst sagas, just don't do justice. It is of course interesting, but fast crawling bypasses the raw emotions and strangeness presented here. The last moments of Deep Water are a truly broken heart, hearing the thoughts of his widowed family and the adoration and understanding of his friends. This is a fascinating story, and that's what carries the document into such big channels.
