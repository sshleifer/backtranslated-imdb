After seeing Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie", I had to buy another movie with her look. I can't believe how she got into this teen movie. It's best to watch this sound with sound, but focus on Meredith as he moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on "Beyond the Prairie". It is worth it at all costs, this must pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of her news would fit, but I didn't see them. Cathrine Bell and Dana Delany's eyes have a much younger body. <br /> <br />
