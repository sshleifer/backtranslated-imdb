A very entertaining version of the screen of Ron Jaffe's best-selling boiler about the experiences and troubles (and, of course, love) of a group of women who are somehow involved in a New York publishing house. Directed by Jean Negulesco, quite fresh from the success of "Three Coins in the Fountain", and a prototype for "Sex and the City", except that sex takes place off screen. Clear young female talents of the day, (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer) are all pretty busy, while Joan Crawford performs as Queen Bitch editor who would probably eat Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly and spit it out; with no effort at all steals film. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it wasn't Rossano Brazzi, it had to be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before he wisely decided to go to the camera) and Brian Aherne. There are more foams in the display than you can find in your average laundry room, but if I like "Desperate Housewives" like me, not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and the company, then you'll probably love it. Very guilty.
