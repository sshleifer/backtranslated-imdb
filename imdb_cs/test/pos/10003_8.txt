Bill Paxton took the true story of an American golf course from 1913 and made a film that is a little more than a simple golf game. The film also deals directly with the class tension of the early twentieth century and touches on the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American businesses. But there is a movie in the heart about the persistent favorite triumph against the chance. Acting is exemplary. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the film's revelation is Shia LaBoeuf, which delivers disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as the working class Franco-Irish kid who struggles with his New England WASP prejudice. For those who are just familiar with his slap-stick performances in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of his maturity is a pleasant surprise. And Josh Flitter as a ten-year-old caddy threatens to steal every scene he appears in. Old-fashioned film in the best sense of the word: subtle gaming, clear direction and a great story to end - the last scene loving Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures to fill a great movie.
