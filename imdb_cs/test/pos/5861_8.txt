"Murder by Numbers" by star Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebellious educated people who are happy with the perfect murder to overcome the broken self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays a heroic thorn in the way of her plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is nowhere near the traditional secret of finger-killing, as the film kindly reveals to us the murderers (Gosling and Pitt). Instead, the film focuses on killing them and has what it takes to commit a perfect murder. The title itself is legally elected for various reasons, especially since the "numbers" in the title are the loudest. An angle that focuses on the reasons for an outrageous killing, even if you are persecuted by its cool dialogue (especially from ruthless boys), will not fully live by exploring the origins of what leads them to their deadly madness. The characters are riveting you have a good looking rich kid Richard (Ryan Gosling) and a smart but socially embarrassing Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise each other and even share sympathy with the classmate's name Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside school they are allies and work together to ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind. Of course, the story with the boys seems to be exciting, but in the background it's shifted to a lighter subplot involving Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes that their murders were due to discrimination (that is, Gosling's arrogant appearance) and inexplicable qualities, but he did it right. Initially, viewers can despise Cassie's character because he is very stubborn and not very supportive. She shows domination and control of her younger partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even if he tries to understand her, he knows it's a battle he'll probably not win. The reason for her behavior is that Cassie was a sad victim of a crime that has left her a permanent mental scar. This side story does not have much space in this film because it does not offer anything thrilling with the main plot (boys' murder). It also offers some development for the Bullock character in the movie, but it's just half-assed work and not very fulfilling. I would like it if the devil students had a side story. Resources were right in front of them for a perfect crime foil, creative plans for boys who could manipulate the cops with their false evidence and lies to get out of the potential prison life. Despite the broken sub-lands and the meaningless "real killer" ending with "Murder By Numbers", powerful performance is doing great casting. Sandra Bullock was convincing as a hard verbally ruthless cop trying to push her inner pain into a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as a young detective who tries to comprehensively understand his partner and is able to repel her occasional tyrannical put-downs. Stealing scenes, however, are the evil duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, who are holding you in their seats waiting for what they will do next. The boys' chemistry is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
