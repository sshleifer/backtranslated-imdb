This film is great from start to finish on a group of honey students who team up and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then reviving themselves. Then they examine what is happening from "near death" experiences. As everyone goes through experience, they become persecuted by their deepest fears that seem to be real. It ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead fathers who seem to be upstairs. The cast is the first and Oliver Platt is in one of the best roles in his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland, but he also has a great job. This is a movie that I can watch again and again!
