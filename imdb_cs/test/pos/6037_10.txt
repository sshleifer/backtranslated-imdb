Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret affair with his pianist. If he threatens to expose him and create a scandal, if he doesn't leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to murder her and look like she has committed suicide. Too bad for him is our case of confused detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) is on the case. Stephen Bochco has written another episode with a sharp series shaver that followed amazing details with beautiful details. We watch the villain commit his murder and build an alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely immersed. It is even better when Columbo appears on the scene. First we'll see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he is at the vet with his new dog. The purely comic relief scenes are usually the weakest on the show (I think Columbo is the inconvenience over the naked model in "Suitable for framing"). Columbo is cheerful when deliberately distracted or troubled to go to the quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him absurd light when he is with suspects. Bochco, on the other hand, shows Columbo somewhat embarrassed with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I am grateful he didn't feel like taking a break at Columbo's attempt to give the dog a name. If we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode and Peter Most of them do Falk. He is particularly good at the monologue, where he expresses no confidence that everyone can kill himself, let alone this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And it's even better in its scenes where it plays with a cat and a Cassavetes mouse. These two longtime friends and co-workers are expected to play brilliantly. and that's what we get. Note how Alex Benedict can't help but admire the misleadingly confused Columba, even if a brilliant detective tightens a loop around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco gets the most out of his scenario. When Columbo asks Bennoci's snooty mechanic, of course? Of course! ?? he asks the man to look at his own pile. And when Benedict finds Columba in the Hollywood Bowl before the rehearsal, of course? Of course! ?? is on the piano playing "Chopsticks". And what should our brave lieutenant bring with us, but the victim's typewriter with a false note about suicide in the roller. Columbo also has good scenes with Dawn Frame and beautiful Blythe Danner playing Cassavetes' wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy appear as Danner's mother, though she does little with her smaller role. Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, primarily as a coach in "Cheers") does a perfectly worthy job, though he follows the leadership of almost every other "Columbo" director by adding one or two silly flourishes. The scene ends by going out of focus and starting by getting into focus. Then there's the piece where Cassavetes sees a carnation that fell to the crime scene? and we see a shot in his sunglasses. There is also one scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old masters that is horribly done by everyone except Cassavetes. But they are quarrels. This is a great fun episode that has become a "Columbo" fan.
