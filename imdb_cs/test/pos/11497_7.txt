Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a night club in New York and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene comes home to find a note from Carl that she needs "some space" .... and a bouquet of daisies, her favorite flower. Jo immediately places the daisies in the blender and presses the button. Soon after, he sets out on a journey to find Carl somewhere in the West, because he is "devoted" to Carl. However, when he finally watches him in Texas, Jo camps near his home, first, hoping to find clues to his decision to leave. She meets a beautiful sculptor - a neighbor (Goran who can't spell her name!), But Jo discourages her attraction to her. When he learns that Carl may have a new girlfriend, he decides to consult a Mexican American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Yeah, he's committed, but does that mean anything to Carla? This is a very imaginative, quite funny look at a marriage promise. It's an unpredictable scenario and the unconventional style is downright infectious. Graham is just great, because the woman who is in trouble is letting go. Wilson does not give his best performance but is adequate as a mixed husband. The rest of the cast is pretty nice, however, with Goran's gorgeous one gorgeous as a sexy neighbor. The scenery, both in New York and Texas, is very beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies and independent movies, this one is for you. This goes to a different rhythm that is most attractive, but still brings a happy ending in the final category.
