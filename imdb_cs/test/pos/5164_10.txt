The latest film by director Roy Andersson You, The Living, is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that with his own words he broke through the Anglo-Saxon tradition of telling stories, a template of most Western film productions. Another reason may be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy in symbolism, his, unlike those of, say, Andrei Tarkovsky, are more elusive. It took him 3 years to finish this 86-minute film and it wasn't because he was forced to take long breaks between the shootings because of financial problems or actor problems. The film consists of 57 vignettes made mostly by the camera, and it was a careful execution of each of these scenes that required a lot of time. The film of this film, which is closely related to the director's previous film Song of the Second Floor, is of the utmost importance to the story, and this story is largely told by the surroundings and environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe live and interact. Before every scene was finally shot, it would be less than 10 different test shots with different actors, colors, dialogs, etc. The result is a dreamy version of the outside world that most of us would know and if it's set to dream, why not dream a little? As in Bunuel's discrete charm of the bourgeoisie, when someone says, "I had a dream last night", you can watch it. But again, what is perceived here as reality is not much different from dreams. Despite the fact that the film lacks a conspiracy in the traditional sense of the word and there are no major characters like the various characters that appear and appear in different scenes, they still meet and their stories are inextricably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. A trailer litter chain smoking and binge drinking a woman who dreams of having a motorcycle so that she can get away from "all those stupid", her corpulent and mostly silent friend and his fragile and seemingly subtle but rather absent-minded mother, brass band members whose home improvement skills do not receive a favorable income from their families, nor from their neighbors, the Middle East depressing hairdresser and his arrogant customer on the road to "very important business negotiations", an elderly man with a bombers nightmare a young girl dreams of marrying a young rock star that she is so madly in love with. It's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality, but it works just like the assertion in support of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human communication is a misunderstanding." People talk to each other, but it's like they talk to each other. They try to reach out to others, but others close them when they try to get to them. You, Living, is a poetic film that is physically located in Stockholm, but universally applicable. The society he portrays is Sweden, his artistic language and exposed people are generally unmistakably Nordic. The subject he deals with, namely the misery of mankind in the selfish world, extends far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of the subject, the film seems to be much more cheerful and full of humor than one might expect. But according to the director himself, "living for each of us is so complicated that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". So this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensibilities and not on the depressing black reality. It's unusual in your language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will surely find this movie fun and meaningful. This was unveiled at this year's Cannes festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which offers "original and diverse works" out of competition. After the film was featured in Salle Debussy, a 1000 strong audience gave it standing ovation for a few minutes. Do I have to say more?
