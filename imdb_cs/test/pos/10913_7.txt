The funniest performance was Shalom Harlow, as a supermodel friend of Matt Dillon. It was more interesting to me than all the main actors. This movie does it all wrong; even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusas, was unable to rise above the ridiculous conspiracy. I liked hearing the "Macho Man" from the Village People over the final credits. The rest of the film could be tolerable if it were to increase to this level of energy.
