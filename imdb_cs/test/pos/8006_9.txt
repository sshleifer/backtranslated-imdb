Ah, Batman is back, is it possible to have a sequel almost as good as the original? With Batman coming back, it came pretty close! We have amazing actors and a great plot with a dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman, and he's still amazing than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and she was perfectly thrown away. Like I love and it's an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't be Catwoman, she doesn't really look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as a penguin? He was just great and scary! Batman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, celebrating Christmas time, Max Shrek playing the haunted Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who is mistaken for his beautiful secretary, Selina, who hears too much in her office, causing him to push her out of the window in the hope of dying, and never revealing that they know Penguin and try to make him beloved. Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go with her cats! But there is another active villain, a penguin who is looking for his parents who have left him and now he is trying to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city anyway? <br /> <br /> You'll have to see! Batman Returns is as good as the original Batman, despite the fact that the first one remained a true classic. And come on, I think we have Michelle in the skin! Her classic moment when you meet Batman and The Penguin "Meow" is classic! There are unforgettable characters, lines and sets! You'll have a blast! Believe me! 9/10
