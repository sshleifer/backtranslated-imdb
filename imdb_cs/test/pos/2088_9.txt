I watched "9 souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 refugees, all very different characters from each other. They decide to stay with the red van in Japan. Every time a van stops, we see these nine refugees trying to escape the past to build a new life or fulfill a dream. However, no matter how hard it tries, it seems impossible and their violent past comes to them and leads them to their ultimate destruction. Although it's a very pessimistic movie, it's not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda heroes cannot escape "prison" and face divine punishment for "crimes". They are small pieces of beautiful painting where the tower of Tokyo dominated, shown as a huge knife upside down!
