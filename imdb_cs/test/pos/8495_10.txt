This film inspired me to be a better person. In life, you don't know who you will encounter and sometimes our prejudices will cause a person to make a false prejudice. I learned to give a man the benefit of doubts because of this film. I also learned that hard love can build a stronger person. Now I want to know where to find the movie soundtrack. There are songs in this soundtrack that I have been trying to get for years. I can comment on acting for a while. Jamie Fox was excellent. The man became an actor actor. Also, the performance of Regina King was amazing. If I can get a woman to look at me as she looks at Ray ... I can only dream. For this movie I got rid of $ 18.00 and I don't have a lot of money, but I'm willing to see this movie over and over again. This movie touched me.
