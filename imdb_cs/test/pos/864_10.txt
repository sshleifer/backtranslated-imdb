Cheerful and low-budget comedy is the best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-confident humor resembles really scary kids in the hall. Be prepared for some of the random and reciting worthy lines, filled with ethnic insults and terrible language. Sex Toys Included! There should be more comedy like today around. This collection of sketches on one DVD guarantees many views and revisions to appreciate some parts. If you enjoyed The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for more fame. If you are considering it for younger audiences, I would say that every child on the ground should see it.
