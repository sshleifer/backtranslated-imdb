I don't know much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and I can only look at it as fun. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year), but once I started, I had to watch the end. - never my favorite genre - but it's extremely photographed (mostly in super-saturated windows) and behaved well. Like a good novel, I couldn't give it. All the while I wished I watched it in the cinema to make music and a photo of justice. What happened to his release in theaters? I am an admirer of Chiwetel Ejiofor because I saw him in Dirty Pretty Things and Hilary Swank looks amazing - very feminine and sexy to change (maybe out of place but adds visual appeal to the movie). <br /> <br /> This picture deserves a wider audience than it seems.
