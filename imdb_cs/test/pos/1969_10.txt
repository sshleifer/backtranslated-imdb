That was a movie I came across by chance. I was walking and seeing him at Showtime, so I was watching. Now I watch it at least once a month. This is a movie that is filled with symbols that could cause some people to make it trash. Don't listen to people who hate this movie if they want an action movie with expensive f / x, they should rent a movie they promise. If you're in the mood for good science fiction, I highly recommend. If you shop on a DVD, I recommend the Atlantic Alliance release, which contains many other extras than Dimension Films.
