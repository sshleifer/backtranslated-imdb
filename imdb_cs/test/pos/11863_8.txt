Every boy of Liv Tyler meets, loses her head, of course, without any little encouragement from Liv. Liv is the most beautiful of her, Matt Dillon is among the tops. An interesting introductory premise, telling the story from everybody's stomach, degenerates into the final of the sitcom (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which he has more than a few similarities). It's worth watching.
