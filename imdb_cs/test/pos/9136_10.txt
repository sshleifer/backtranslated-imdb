I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie, because here at IMDb it is quoted that John Woo, the average director who made some decent movies in his pre-American years, but completely destroyed his reputation as his latest in American movies, plans to remake him . Here are a few reasons why it's one of the stupidest remake ideas ever: The film's story is simple and even a clich√© to today's standards, but what makes the film a masterpiece is the four main characters, the unique director of Mellville, cinematography, music and her style. There is no way any director can do such a film today, it is not possible to create such a film atmosphere in today's targeted film industry. John Woo made a more or less decent movie that he borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember that it was when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and more expensive (in salaries) but actors. So what I'm saying is that it's one of the biggest movies ever made, along with another film called Melville - Le Samourai. Bach. And even if the remake is done, try to avoid it before you see a great original.
