I have to watch this film in my French class as part of the legend of "French culture". I thought it was filmed and the editing was really good, but it was especially fun, especially the one who played Wendy's brother. Also, the story was really good, just as it was credible and yet adventurous as well. Favorite Part: When William makes fun of a German guy studying and behaves as a fly to reproduce! :) <br /> <br /> My French isn't so good, but with subtitles I could get enough of what's going on. <br /> <br /> WATCH!
