A few days ago I viewed this film at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas. Punk! Everybody involved in the film contributed to his punkness. Music, of course. However, the film captured the entire punk genre. Even grandmother and teacher (I) can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality (reality, reality, film). This film takes a handful of young filmmakers and clearly and cleverly shows the "why" of their anxiety about not giving the green light to finish Waldo. The (fairly) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a nice rest from the constant (but understandable) shaking of the dude who left them in the church. I have to love Stu. And don't forget to watch / read credits - they're icing on the cake!
