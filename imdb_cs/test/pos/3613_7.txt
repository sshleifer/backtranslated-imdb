John Madden gave us a wonderful movie again. A simple but beautiful story set in true paradise and music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck pleases us again, and good deeds, but ......... why on Earth is Penelope Cruz in this movie? While watching this movie, I asked myself the same question. Of course, her Greek accent is unbelievable, she is not even able to act on one scene. She didn't do a good job at the end, after so many events, after years she finally met Corelli again and couldn't change the same face of stupidity we had to carry throughout the film. Cage was very good at one of his best characters. Hurt also is great at his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the end result is a movie that is really worth watching. It's a beautiful movie that even Mrs. Cruz couldn't spoil. So far, I think it's Madden's best job, so no fan will be disappointed.
