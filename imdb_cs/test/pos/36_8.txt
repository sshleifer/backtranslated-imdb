LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fun, witty, emotionally charged HBO-TV based on childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This joyful cinematic experience is centered around guardian Santiago-Hudson, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, big black woman who ran a boarding house in New York in the 1950s. Nanny was an organization that was the only woman whose boarding house was filled with drunks, abandoned people, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in the city who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The essence of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin), a boy whose divorced parents were unable to properly raise the boy to take Nanny. S. Epatha Merkeson, who has been wasted for years. The ungrateful role of Lieutenant Van Buren of NBC LAW & ORDER turns into a performance power like Nanny, a neighboring mother-figure whose pension has become a symbol for the oppressed black people in her city. Merkeson is nothing spectacular in a performance that earned her the Golden Globe and Emmy Award. Merkeson is supported by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's wife), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and beautifully scored, this is one of a kind of movie experience that works at all levels, but if for no other reason, it's worth seeing the electrifying main performance of S. Epatha Merkeson, which is given to life and as much as possible.
