He recently traveled in Norway from Bergen, Norway and stopped in the small town of Voss in Norway and was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne, who was born in Voss. The people who know about this Knute and the guides are proud to stop at his memorial. This film is a great history of this great man and his great love of Notre Dame. He never realized that Knute had such great talents in chemistry and laboratory sciences as he had also taught chemistry for several years while coaching a football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (Gipper), who was an excellent football player; Reagan had a short role, but in this film he gave a big supportive role. Donald Crisp (father John Callahan) was excellent as a priest who had a great faith in Knute throughout his life in Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie to be seen by many generations. Enjoy.
