I was delighted to have witnessed this brilliant movie at a screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see it. Pleasure is not an emotion you have left as credits. 2:37 is a film that deals not only with one stigma felt by young individuals, but all. The main one is insulation. It's not just that the movies are placed on the gallery on the pedestal over others, but rather it's important to see it as a climax. And from this it is important to realize what it represents for you as a viewer and for those who directly influence it. 2:37 is not a soft image, but the way in which Mr. Thalluri handle it is a subject with deep dignity, and it is not held by a barred approach acting like a loan it's a message. <br /> <br /> I don't believe that movies like 2:37 should be reduced by favor votes. Rather, it should be recommended to those who are looking for purpose while viewing them. Brilliantly created portrait of innocence lost. And a masterful blow for so far untapped talent. <br /> <br /> Don't miss.
