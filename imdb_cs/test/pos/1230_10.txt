This is a scary short movie. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that are wounded, true and remain with you. Because this is called a tragic story this is not much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even if it was right for the story, because I already cared about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have influenced me so much. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber works all around, even when using the right sound and / or music to advance the story. The final song finished the work and waved me more emotion. This is the first speed from start to finish. Kudos to the writer / director and all involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first movie review in the comments section. I promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review could be good or bad, just my honest opinion. That's it and it's the least I can do. I'm so glad I have to see it.
