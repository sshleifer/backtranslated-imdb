It's a very great movie (documentary) about Istanbul and their people, and it's music of all kinds. The director's editing and success are very impressive. I was interested in Faith Akin because I saw "Gegen die Wand" ("Head-On") and admired his work, but this was the most sensitive to me. Here I write. It's not just about the Turks or something like that, it's a very good biography of the city and how the music lives in it. There are many people's opinions and so very different ideas about life and love. I liked it very much and I noticed that everyone and everyone should see it.
