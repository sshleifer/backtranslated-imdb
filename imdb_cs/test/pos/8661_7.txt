This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway and committing suicide. But another scene shows him coming to a lonely bus to the desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working in a modern aseptic office as an accountant. Coworkers seem nice when they are protected, they soon meet a girlfriend, but the city seems to be strange because the food doesn't taste, alcohol doesn't make you drunk and there are no children around them. Is it a dream or is it in paradise or in hell? While sometimes the movies look like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even in ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it's a pretty provocative idea. The best scenes are those in which there is an exaggerated minimum, as when dealing with trivial conversations about interior decoration and reeling to discuss deeper issues. I have always thought that there is something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way it seeks to suppress the basic desires of human nature. And this film is best when it devastates the critique of this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film will end long and the director does not seem to end it, but most of what is running is worth seeing.
