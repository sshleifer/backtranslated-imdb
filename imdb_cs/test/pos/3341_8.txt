This film was originally released as a soft "X", apparently with explicit sex deleted. Later, the producers "relieved" (they felt money) and re-released it with renewed scenes (probably only about 3 minutes). Since Kristine stood, she was against her and her promising career stopped. I think it's all timing (Pam Anderson's career testimony) - but Ronald Reagan was in charge of Kristina's debacle (we didn't hear about Nancy Reagan's affairs), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during "Memory". . Sex is just a cake topping, both versions will satisfy. This naughty musical is above something similar to others that have been released simultaneously.
