First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users who commented on this film (from Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was a "communist". If the user actually watched the film, it was that he was not a Communist but no one but Belgium, the US, the United Nations, etc. As a "communist" leader of other people, businesses and countries. political and economic gains. Even if one decides to accept the film involved in "revisionist history" it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was a communist, especially coming from a country that "awarded" Congo independence, and from Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATICALLY to his seat as Prime \ t t Minister. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've ever seen. Depicting the struggles of the African freedom fighter ELECTED Prime Minister for his first leader, Mr. Peck, is doing a very laudable job of bringing all the pieces together into one job. And it must have been a task. Given that most people outside Congo and Belgium are unlikely to know the history of Lumumba and Congo, beyond some light covered by African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their secondary / secondary schools (or perhaps universities). at college level), a class he had his job turned off for him. And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" took more than 3 hours, "Lumumba" runs under 2 hours. And the most interesting 115 minutes was when we found that his desire not to maintain compromises with the Western powers (which is responsible for the atrocities of his people, especially Belgium), while trying to fight power struggles within his own borders, apparently even with some of his Friends is amazing that man lived as long as he did. This is MUST be seen by all who are interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. . You won't be disappointed.
