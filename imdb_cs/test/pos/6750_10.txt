I think this movie was made as well as it could be. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000 - I'm surprised it wasn't worse. If you don't care about CG or special effects, this movie is great. Well, the movie isn't that good (I'm sure it could have been, but you're trying to do better in just 4 months), but the story is good and the movie is quite exciting. Don't trust me when I say this movie is good because I also found the 1933 King Kong to be Okay. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I didn't even see the whole movie ...
