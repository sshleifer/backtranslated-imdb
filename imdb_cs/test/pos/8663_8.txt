The bus leaves a nameless man outside the normal Standard Oil refueling station in the middle of nowhere. We will never know where the bus came from, or why it is, or who it is. Why is it the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is it an "annoying man" referred to in the movie title? He died and went to heaven or hell? Like our man, we don't have a chance to stop and wonder. The doorman meets him and closes into an indescribable city. From day one, there are all the choices for him. The apartment was rented, work was found, the office was assigned. In fact, his life is not entirely unlike the life in virtual reality of corporate cubicles and suburban apartments. Women are heartless, parties are tug-of-war, office work suck. But some pieces don't fit. Powerful, gray-clad goons roam quietly across the streets. Are they some paramedics or secret police? And why aren't they children? Is the story set in the real world? Whenever we think we can get some answers, new mysteries come up. "Annoying man" leaves you half of the relief he is over, half wants more. I hope they will soon get into the computer game.
