The pursuers' war is on a weekly show from the guys who brought you CNNNN and the pursuer decides where every 5 chasers and Firth breaks the issues we didn't know were important. The show goes beyond mere satirizing of politics and television by not afraid of taking Mickey from anyone, whether it is a contra-girl in the subway or even a premiere of Australia, and even though it may be a well-known country. let's say American television, it has never been so well done. Chaser's War is the smartest, funniest, and most entertaining show on Australian TV, and if you haven't seen it, you really owe her to watch.
