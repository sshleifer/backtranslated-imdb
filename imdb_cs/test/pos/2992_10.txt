I loved this movie! OH MY GOD! This movie shuddered! I found it between some old tapes and I didn't know what it was and after I read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned that Elton John covered the movie's soundtrack More than before he mentioned what the movie was about.), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What dispute?" I was thinking about how I put tape into the player, I was curious that I got it. And my expectations were certainly met. I loved it! I think it's really a girly kind of movie, but it was so sweet and delightful! It was a wonderful romance, even though the director occasionally reminded me of working with a camera on 'The Graduate', which I thought the director had to be on acid with some of the loved ones when he saw it. OK, so it wasn't possible for these two kids to run away and live on their own ... but it could happen ... in fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the end of me honestly ticked! I was so angry as it ended ... it's something that hangs, and I suppose they can deal with what's happening to them in the sequel ... but at the same time I'm almost hesitant to see it because the sequels are almost never as good first. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone sixteen or more! It's an amazing movie ... Super!
