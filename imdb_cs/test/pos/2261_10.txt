If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely cheerful. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dance on the side of jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures pieces and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know if you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding and thinking, "Yeah. Exactly." It's a lot of fun if you also understand Russian because the headlines just don't do justice. Actors are so believable, and Elijah Wood does a great job of playing a socially awkward Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., grandfather "seeing dog" who is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and sympathetic that you think they are real people.
