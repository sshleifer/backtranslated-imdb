See No Evil With Kane. The film has a great story But it just didn't hide my eyes, Scream out loud Horror Flick I thought it would be from watching WWE Superstars on Monday night Raw When the movie first came to theaters. I made a movie even though I loved the story it played out. GREAT FILM EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE PART 2 <br /> <br /> IT IS NOT MATTER IF KANE GETS KILLED ON THE END in every movie <br /> <br /> They keep out and keep coming back for more So part 2 would be <br /> <br /> Be very interesting.
