what a big little movie, lots of good roles from some random stars. Basically, there are these growers who are trapped in a comedy adventure. The film assures you that everyone will end up dead! Comedy contributes to this. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears - its impossible to imagine the way it could, as an overall paradox. The film is full of twists and turns that argue you to the end. Billy Bob Thornton The Astronaut Farmer) is brilliant, in fact looking back, the character is quite similar in fact to holding a family of pot growers together. Anyone involved in this movie should get a big thumbs up. <br /> <br /> As I say, the last scene is a dream; but a nightmare at the same time. I love it when Hank Azaria (carter) says we should do it every year? I felt they wanted it. I will not say that this film is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner films I give it 10/10. - My advice has a common readiness; Kick and Enjoy!
