Cheezy? Yes. Badly filmed? You betcha. Zero Budget? He proudly claims it on his posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of that)? Certainly. This film celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, mounting into a stereotypical role never escape for a moment; teenagers try to survive being killed by some mysterious forces that have been disturbed by doing something lightly adolescent; absolutely gratuitous nudity; impossible amount of blood coming from the victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners ... and our hero even wears Michael Jackson's jacket! It is not a sort of spoof like Scary Movie, but rather a movie that paid tribute to the innocence of the 80's horror movies ... if you were scared and scared it could be fun, stupid sexy and goofy time!
