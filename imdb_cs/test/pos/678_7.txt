With its only set, minimal cast and straightforward photos (with the exception of a few short special effects), the film reminds me of one of those old drama dramas of 60 minutes that are so popular in the early years of television. The tension, however, hangs heavily over Ida Lupine's widow, when she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood swings kills her. And who's better to play the problem than the big actor Ryan. He wasn't too versatile - he watched his essay almost painful. But no one was better at the On Dangerous Ground or the psychic pain of this film. Few actors with their eyes could express as much as this slim and towering figure. Lupine's problem is that he is locked in his home with a man who is kind and gentle for a moment and another rages. Tensions come from her various tricks to keep him happy when trying to escape. It's the whole nail. This is not one of Lupine's many subtle "soulful" parts on which she was so good. Instead, it is a role that many smaller actresses can handle. My favorite scene is with Ryan and the brothers teenage Margaret Whiting. Ryan already has trouble with his masculinity and what others say about him. When Whiting enters and finds an appealing Ryan who scrubs the floor, she starts bothering and flirting with her hopeful sexuality. Ryan sensed her trouble and suddenly bounces it off - not a strong suit. Whiting, Whiting invades his masculinity by calling his work "women's work". That's what he does. Until then he was courteous and professional with Lupine, who was trying to get on the normal road. But Whiting hit his raw nerve. Now shit is paying because Whiting bounces off the door, so Lupino will pay the price. It's a stunning scene, professionally done. Anyway, it is one of a dozen films made by Lupino and her husband when the audience moved from these little black and white girls. wide-angle glasses. Very bad. What is an extremely talented figure standing behind the camera and in front. He deserves at least an honest Oscar from the film industry she has contributed so much to.
