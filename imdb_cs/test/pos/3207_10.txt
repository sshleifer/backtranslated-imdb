I'm not the type of person looking at T.V. shows that acting normally sucks, or it is unrealistic or dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can touch characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is best for her sarcastic comments that may seem a little bad. Rory Gilmore is a good model for all girls. She is proud to attend Harvard and the boys / boys always in second place in her book. She is a faithful friend and always a peace-keeper. There's a gentle romance that I like, personally. It is not a jolly cheerful romance that many people don't have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. Every character will eventually get it, and at first glance they will not find their enchanting prince and will not "fall in love" with every guy who comes on the road. It's a realistic show, but when you look at it, you better collect movies, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes links. I fell in love with this show and if you give her a chance, you do.
