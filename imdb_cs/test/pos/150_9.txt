The great thing Thirst, the last Chanwook Park movie, is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you may take it as a minus, but in fact it's a big plus. The park takes the vampirism method seriously, as does the narrative love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters - Sang-hyeon is a priest who is undergoing a medical experiment he is not familiar with, turns him into a sick but true blue vampire and Tae-Joo with his mother and "idiotic" brother That is killed by a Sang in a very strong melodramu. There is nothing terribly crying and shameless about the story and the characters at any time, and the consequences of religion earlier (for example, Sang, is considered a healer because he has risen because of his vampirism, even as it simply cannot and does). those about good vs. evil, pushing it into another plane kinematic. Thirst also rises to the stunning standard of art that Park has shown with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and underestimated, I'm Cyborg, but that's fine, it should be considered given. Thirsty is a film with juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is filmed and edited with eyes for a mood that is part of a satirical, romantic / erotic, partly dramatic and ultimately fantastic. And not always vampirsim behaves like a simple horror set (although as a horror park it has more than just its frightening scenes). It's more like the Near Dark movie, which never mentioned the word vampire, but let you know it was, and treated it with sincerity and kind of clear traces of attention, and that the disease itself and its influence on human existence may be more frightening than killing or bloodshed. Once you see one vampire jumping up really high or healing his wounds, you have seen all 'thirst' also has a bad sense of humor, just like Oldboy, just here with a bite (the pun wanted to emphasize the bizarre physical states of being. this can be found with the priest's predilection of sucking blood from people in a coma by taking their blood tube and sucking it on the floor, or the way Tae-Joo holds one scrap of humanity by keeping his mother alive, even though he has something like stroke and can just blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of responding to shit, bringing her pain and horror, but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. how elements come together, dramatic and existential pains, the bunuel-surrealistic meaning of Catholicism (I loved mainly the dynamics between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives but it really wants to be a vampire too) and eroticism: scenes where the priest finally gets to Tae-Joo are incredible with their pace and length of shots and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic way, but in the sense of relaxing and escaping these characters, which does not take long beyond the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as big as Oldboy, it's not something carp. Not all films by Chanwook Park directors will reach their masterpieces (and at least will always be known as the man who directed the film). But Thrist is a great addition to his work, and to a serious strip of vampire films in general. Film production is sharp and exciting and even dangerous (and what is the white room of the "daylight" of the characters they live in!), Humor is dark and cheerful, acting is intense and moody - especially from the gentle moves of Kangho and unpredictable The evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin, and the end when he finally gets there, is one of those really wonderful vampire-movie endings you will talk about for years, in a good way. In a duel between thirst and dusk, thirst deals with knock-out in the first round. Between Let Right In or Near Dark is harder to call. 9.5 / 10
