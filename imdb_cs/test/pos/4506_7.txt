Guilt and redemption are two of the basic emotions and conspiracies of elements of heavy, powerful dramas that Oscars love so much (which is a kind of fun because "The Kite Runner" was only nominated for Best Original Score - lack of nominations might be unfair). While most film adaptations of books (or other means) are usually worse than their literary counterparts (and "The Kite Runner" is no exception), Marc Forster's film adaptation is good. Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I won't go into conspiracy, except that the book remains true to its source. This means that if you do not know the plot, check out the movie, or better yet, read the book. The best thing "The Kite Runner" did for her (except for her story) is director Marc Forster. Forster is a director with an epic range and a unique vision that is perfectly used to bring Khaled Hosseini's book to the screen. The small part worried me that he would use the same dreamy images contained in one of Forster's earlier features, "I'm looking for Neverland." Don't get me wrong, "Finding Neverland" is a great movie, one of my favorite movies, but the visual trick he used there is no place. Fortunately, Forster understands it and the brilliance of his direction shows his versatility. Although the lack of a nomination for Best Director for his work is not exactly the same, it is clear that there are a number of statuettes on the road behind him. <br /> <br /> Note is also a scenario adaptation. It remains true to the source, but leaves room for Forster's vision to interpret the material. The dialogue is not humiliated and that. along with Forster, he is moving at a steady pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition at the time of the award for the script was not indignation, but I wouldn't complain if it was at least nominated. The dividing line between this movie is great and Excellent lies with acting. Most shows are tough, but there are some that don't make any cut, and the film hurts. The most notable weak performance comes from Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays young Amir. It's not that bad, it's just that it's not as effective as it could be. He just can't translate the blame that consumes Amira into the audience. In fact, I think I may have lost a little at this point at this point because I didn't read it. He looks grim and occasionally angry, but we can't feel his emotions. This is a difficult part to be portrayed, and for most of them young Ebrahimi holds his own, which is especially surprising because it is his first film role. The best performances come from Khalid Abdally, who plays adult Amir and Shaun Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdalla doesn't have to be a familiar name (though he was in Paul Greengrass's "United 93"), but his work is amazing. He is a quiet, humble man, and when he needs it, he emits it perfectly. A less capable actor was able to put Rahim Khan in a cliché, but Shaun Toub uses in his performance enough subtlety and care he creates, what the cliché is trying to display. Forgive me for going to praise, but that's something I have to address, and that's PG-13. The fact that this film has received such a low rating is outrageous. There is no reason for this. Some might argue that the rating was bent over the need for everyone to see it, as in the "Saving Private Ryan", which some said the film deserved the NC-17 rating. However, this exception cannot be applied. The only purpose of the scene is to tell the story. Forster (probably by the producers' command) tried as hard as he could tame the most painful and busiest movie scene to allow the film to smuggle with PG-13 rating, but the subject material was too intrusive to be displayed. regardless of whether it is tasteful. Worse, this editing robs the scene of much of its power, and by trying to make it less intrusive to get a lower rating is offensive. Some scenes of violence are also incredibly intrusive. As to how much time these scenes take from the film, it doesn't add much, but what is there deserves a minimum of R. MPAA, whose film rating system has always been corrupt, sank to a new low by giving this film such low rating. But the film shouldn't be blamed for it. The film is a solid film that is worth seeing, especially if they are fans of the book.
