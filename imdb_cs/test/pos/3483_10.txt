Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and lives in a quiet and boring life in the Carrigmore residential house. When a newcomer joins him, Rory (McAvoy), he continues to show Michael how to live around a disability. Despite, or perhaps, because, Rory's crippling disability (unable to move all but his head and a few digits on hand), Rory is wildly independent, and extremely rebellious. His influence on the silent and reserve Michael is spectacular, and the two soon leave home care to establish lives in the surrounding world where they hire help Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a care assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the gems of the year! Just like last year's movie In America, the film goes from extremely funny, to anxious, touching, upsetting, and truly moving, without once seemingly sweet sugar. O'Donnell, who knew exactly where to go for the heart, and where to leave the story and characters, did their great movie, which tells us all to look beyond the surface and see what lies inside. /> <br /> The true strengths of the film appear with leading actors. So compelling are their characters who truly believe they are disabled. It's amazing when humor and sorrow can be conveyed over great performances. The couple really looks like close friends, and as their story unfolds, you take care of them completely. This is definitely one of the best examples of the film this year, which in a simple way tells a very relevant story. If this film does not touch your heart, then you must have clean ice inside.
