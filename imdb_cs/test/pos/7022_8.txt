Great music, great dance, sexy star (Swayze) and real sexual desire shown by female character (very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are mainly motivated by lust and it's a nice change. I also think that the film captures very well what it is like to be a teenager who copes with class questions and that the ideals that have come into reality have suddenly emerged. Of course he is happy now - after all, it is a film musical - but in fact it is a real joy - a fun romance and also politically enlightened. This film also has one of my favorite movie lines: "I carried a watermelon."
