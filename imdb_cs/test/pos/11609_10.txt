I was able to see this great movie at Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I came out of the cinema, I felt dazed down * g *! I really saw a lot of movies and there are only a few that I have called perfect as Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who watched him in Berlin came out of the room and I can understand it completely because it can be a real shock to someone who lives in his perfect world day by day dreaming of his dreams not thinking about it what's terrible about it. planet in our life! I don't think I have to describe the story of the movie for you because the people on this page have already written! It's a movie that shows everything and more !!! Get 10 points + from 10 !!! It would be nice if you could give me people who also saw that they love it, email me! Finally I'm sorry for my bad English-I'm not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so !!! :-))))))))
