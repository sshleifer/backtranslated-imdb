"L'appartement" must be among the best French films I've ever seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great films by Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard). Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in the lead roles. Besides "Brotherhood of the Wolves" and "Dobermann" I haven't seen a bad movie with this pair yet. "L'appartement" sucks you from the start and twists and turns keep you excited to the end. The narrative fragment doesn't really work well because of "Pulp Fiction". Hopefully there will be no pious American remake of this unique romance / mystery-thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A goddamn American remake was made!)!
