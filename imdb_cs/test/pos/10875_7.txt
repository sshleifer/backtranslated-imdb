A film about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become friends with two surfers. I caught it in an art cinema in America in 1981. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was 19), so I was wondering how Australian teenagers acted. Script wise here is nothing new. This shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what would happen before he did it, but I was never bored. Interestingly, despite the accent and several changes in clothing and hair, these teenagers are not very different from American teens. They had many of the same problems and hung up. It was also based on a book from a real surfer and her real life adventures (and I heard) that it was a faithful adaptation. The acting was fine, but the actors were attractive and it was well done and interesting enough. So this is no extraordinary masterpiece, but a fairly accurate representation of what a teenager is and trying to be with your favorite kids. I give it 7.
