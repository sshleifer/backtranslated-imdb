In the 1980s, I was watching this series on PBS and still watching old tapes every few years. Very atmospheric and sometimes haunted. This is a very good show because the characters are well defined and acted. They are drawn into a conspiracy and come to take care of these people. Demons are almost ridiculously evil, especially the Nottingham Sheriff. Man, I'd like to beat s - t from the crazy little bastard. Nicholas Grace has an excellent job and had to have a great time to be a sheriff. His whipping boy, Sir Guy, is equally hissing, but also pathetic. Lots of murders and chaos in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of this nature. I noticed that he was given a prize for children's television, which is surprising. If I had children, I wouldn't let them watch it. Excellent use of places in this show also. Now it's on DVD, so go out and buy it.
