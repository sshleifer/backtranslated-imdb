I've never heard of this movie when I was given a translation, so I didn't know what to expect. I checked it on IMDb and curiously. It didn't take long for him to realize it was a gem. Excellent performances, great story, both well managed and well written. It's hard to compare with other movies, but "Stand by me" comes to mind, although it has so many differences from "medicine" as similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship between young boys and dramatic and humorous elements is the most obvious similarity between this film and "Stand by me". Other than that the "cure" is a fine film in its own right, well worth wider recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also funny. I can't think of one thing that bothers me. When I said it, I don't want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever it means, but rather that I enjoyed it immensely, I was very moved and does not change anything in it. I will not deal with a detailed story / story description, partly because it is either too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find this information elsewhere on the web. In conclusion, I can only say: Wonderful movie, see if you get a chance.
