This film precedes Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in dialogue, placement, photography, direction, and political philosophy. The photo is certainly self-confident. The direction is stylish and mostly well done. If you liked the early Australian films of Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, then you will love Oz. The direction also reminds the reviewer of the current work of Edgar Wright. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was far ahead of its time. Critics of 1967 hated it and the public remained away - the 1960s Australia, like the 1940s US, was in some ways a kind of place where consensus was important, as this film is very different from those viewers would expect, especially after reading. advertising posters. This film will most likely be more attractive to today's audience: it is still hostile and confident, but in the current European way rather than the Australian journey of the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared in the Australian television series 'The Prisoner') plays her role with a less brutal passion than her contemporary Jacki Weaver would possibly have done, instead the character of Dunstan in this film conveys some rather capricious powers of Australian women most famously represented \ t Kylie Minogue playing Charlene Mitchell in the Australian TV series Neighbors and further developed in later roles in her career. Men also enjoy this movie, which poses different male issues in a different way than most other films from the US or even Australia in the mid-1960s. Bruce Spence (who later went on to play Tion Medon in 'Star Wars III', Trainman in 'Matrix' films, and a helicopter pilot in 'Road Warrior' and 'Thunderdome' Movies) plays a central and enduring role that firmly supports the rest of the cast. This film is worth seeing the performance of Bruce Spence himself. 7/10 for some minor continuity issues.
