The third and final film by Prisoner Scorpion by Shunya Ito. The series star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). Original Woman Prisoner # 701: Scorpion is one of my favorite favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. This is generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think if ever it gets a better release on DVD (the original, according to Image, is very bad). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It's much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and ugliness, but it focuses more on story and characters. Sasori (Kaji) escapes the detectives in the first scene (tied to one and tears off his arm and runs with him in tow, which must be seen to be believed!) And unites with a freelance Yuki. Yuki is a hassled local circle of prostitution that includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which has never been solved, is heartbreaking. The images are surprising and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad he never went anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is an amazing movie.
