Here in Germany "king of queens" has a great cultural status! Almost every teenager (and adult) follows this situation system. It's really amazing! Better than other horrible American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series that is still fine is "Al Bundy"). There was no American sitcom in Europe that was as effective as this really fun show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug & Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandfather" I know and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as Deacon & Spence are all but funny guys which I know. I look at him as often as I can and I still don't have good humor!
