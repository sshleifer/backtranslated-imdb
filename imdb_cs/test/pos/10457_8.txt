He feels like an impressionist film; if there is such a thing. The story is well said, very poetic. characters well developed and well functioning interpreters (or interpreted actors :)). The film will delight its own luxurious emotions at times and work well if you hate such emotions in movies - it's not so in my case. It's a very humanistic movie. The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic. > <br /> Good work. <br /> <br /> A good classic for every good movie collection.
