The cast for this Rigoletto production is excellent. Edita Gruber sings the Gild beautifully and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings great. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. As Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing singer in this tough set of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in Contessa. All principles are well known and world-famous. This is the visually and musically exciting Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> I have it on a laser disc and on a DVD. You should have it too!
