The amusing mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess, and the wise play of those who have dubbed voices is almost universally bad, but the assumption is engaging, the battle scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite entertaining. . It's a pity that the story is such a wreck. There are several places where I had no idea what just happened, it was almost as if it had been cut for five minutes and suddenly you were on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is bad when it explains things, and some things don't make much sense, but the film moves on the wind so that its deficiencies hardly register. It's not a great movie in any way, but it's fun.
