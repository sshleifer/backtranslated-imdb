I saw this movie last night and I thought it was decent. I think you should say that. Some scenes with special operations were fine and some of them were very authentic. I will not give this movie to my DVD collection, but it is fair enough to recommend for rent. I think nothing has set the movie at a different level compared to the others of the same genre. The action is good, it is decent, women are in my opinion extremely seductive and exotic and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
