This exotic film Troma is actually a very good movie. It is known as their epic and best and highest rated productions. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely entertaining with the usual nudity of Tromy and Gore. Troma has made some very good movies, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and of course Toxic Avenger movies. I have one Troma movie, "Terror Firmer", which has a reputation for being the bloodiest and most beautiful movie. "Tromeo and Juliet" I enjoyed so much that I must finally watch "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc collector version with four comments and many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute hoof and highly recommended.
