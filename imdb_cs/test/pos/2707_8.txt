The story of Karen Carpenter Story shows more about Karen Carpenter's comprehensive life. Although it cannot give accurate facts, and details. Cynthia Gibb (pictured by Karen) wasn't a good choice. She is a good actress but plays very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. The role of Louis Fletcher as Agnes Carpenter is amazing, doing a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> He has great songs that could be included. in the soundtrack album. Unfortunately, they weren't, although this movie was at the top of the ratings in the US and several other countries
