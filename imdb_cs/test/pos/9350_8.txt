Film noir at its best. Encountered in the immediate aftermath of WWII (1946), "Crossfire" depicts good, bad and ugly of that time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and is therefore automatically perceived through Monty's narrow lens that he was a slacker who got out of the war. Monty doesn't like these people. The truth is, Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you feel good about the hatred ideologies you've been submerged in, and the world is full of this filthy and what is needed. "clean" mark. Monty is a sadist in the winning soldier. The defeats of World War II had more than just their share and filled the hatred, prejudice and soldiers. Some of them were hung on war crimes, such as "aggressive war." This film got its creators in trouble when America's second sadistic cleaner Joe McCarthy got his hearing at the beginning. See "Crossfire" just to see how good actor Robert Ryan was. The real Robert Ryan wasn't Monty. He was great, underrated, under used actor. See "Crossfire" and taste the dark side of America after World War II. Take a look at the good side of America in the late 1940s. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play major roles. Mitchim could play Ryan's role, in fact he did when playing a psychopath in "Cape Fear".
