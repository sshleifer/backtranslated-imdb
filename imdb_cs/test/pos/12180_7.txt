In Queen of The Damned Akasha (Aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger and more demanding presence, just interested you. the film had mistakes, like the lack of explaining Akasha's past. What I also did not like was that the film did not actually explain or mention more about how the relationship between Lestat and Akashou was / or was similar. half of the film and then up, her (Akasha) death came 2 fast. 2 seconds). Akasha's head set off in 1 sec and Lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world. Aaliyah played Akashu very well and Stuart was perfect as Lestat couldn't choose a better Akashu or Lestata. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
