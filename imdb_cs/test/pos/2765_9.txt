I'll be brief: I usually hate movies like this poisonous ... but there's just something about what pulls me in and won't let me go. It is true that there are some serious shortcomings in it (some of the games are at best under the steam and the dialogue is sometimes so bad that it is funny), but there are enough balancing functions to watch. But what is it? Well, it's a great little conspiracy - it's by no means original, but it's better than other movies of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) have done quite decent performances, which have more than disappeared a significant lack of quality from the support cast (fat cop and coach Quinn really tore me off) and scripting is smooth and funny (even if it's bad) The final reason is that this film is so CUTE: I grinned all the way and has a place in my video collection purely because it could encourage someone. You really have to be somehow free of humor to dislike it (DARE someone who can sit up without grimacing!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this one if you want simple fun and - above all - nice watches. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
