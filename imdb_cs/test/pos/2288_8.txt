That was always my favorite movie. I owned a copy of VHS and a few months ago I found a DVD release that is also part of my video collection. I also happen to be a huge baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, I picked up a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book "You Gotta Have WA", which presents the inputs and outputs of Japanese baseball and challenges. that foreign players have encountered gaming in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, I remembered this movie because it seems that the script was almost literally based in this book. Parallels are mysterious. Jack Elliot's character is very similar to Bob Horner, an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also depicted in the character Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran of the Japanese league who made his peace with the frustration of the Japanese game, and helps keep his teammate. Elliot's character goes through the same sequence of meetings as Horner, from the big fanfare signing, the early success that is already driven by the harsh sports media, and the subsequent slump that drives frustration, alienation from teammates, fans, and media, and the resulting disillusionment brought about by the desire to return home to USA. The only difference is that the film adds such Hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. Speaking of the interests of love, I'm sure many viewers have come to this page (as I did) to look at the actress who played "Hiroko" (beautiful Aya Takanashi), and what other job she did. That's just what this movie is about. It turned out that on the basis of an article that I read, a short love scene with Tom Selleck (a stranger) in this movie (mild to our standards - basically kissing when she's in her bath and wearing a towel) caused such indignation from the Japanese public (especially men) that it has never been offered another role of any kind, in movies or television - basically blackballed by the Japanese film industry. It's a real shame because she's (she was) a pretty talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie in terms of baseball elements and cultural differences as I did - find a copy of "You Gotta Have WA" by Robert Whiting. Good reading and great backing book for this movie.
