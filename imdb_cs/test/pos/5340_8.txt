This scene shows how Wallace's experiment using his invention of brain manipulation is terribly bad and creates a "Were Rabbit". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, and therefore he created the "Brain Manipulator". He risked his own life to help solve the problem of Tottington's rabbits and, more importantly, to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits gathered and stored in the cellar. Though he thought his experiment was working, it resulted in more pressure on him and Gromita to find a solution before the annual vegetable contest risked life again. Gromit, a silent loyal dog and faithful assistant, continually contemplates innovative ways to save his master from his radical, crazy inventions that are terribly bad. What is interesting in this movie is trying to identify: who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
