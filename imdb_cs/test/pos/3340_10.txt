I didn't know who Bruce Haack was before he saw this movie. I just saw MOOG doc, which was fine, the only problem was Moog, who led a very happy life, and the document was ... content. Haack's story is filled with all the tragic tragedies that people buy these days, but it has a lot of heart to do with it. Although the film does not go so much into tragic things, one can feel that Bruce has received the award for his music. There are many elements that make up his IE reference. the invention of the people where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It must have been challenging to document Haack's "scatter-brained" output, which was largely in every musical category imaginable (even rap music), but the director closely linked this piece and was able to capture the spirit. And cast ... what a group of characters surrounded Bruce, but what do you expect from a telepathic guru, tripping with children, fighting the music industry. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in music history, it's the mainstream, but it's important.
