I'm not sure how to call this film a children's drama or fantasy movie. When I first saw that I couldn't make out the end and that's the only part of the movie that seemed to lack depth and left me a little depressed for a while. Then I saw it a second time and I realized how great the acting was, and it was clueless why he got the little attention he made at the time. The unforgettable performance of young Mazzello and Wood should be this movie's classic. Although it was probably intended to be a fantasy / drama by an original writer / director (Evans), once Donner took over he probably made it with a more dramatic outlook especially the end, which left much to be desired as to what really happened Bobby - he was killed, he escaped and really do all those fantastic tours? Or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point to the kids? But in everything, it did not provide the closure of the happy ending we are used to in children's film. Maybe it's because it's not just that. <br /> <br /> To find out what could have been a more classic ending See the official Elijah Wood Site, where you will find the first rough draft of the film closure scenario (Probably the Original Writer) <br /> <br /> Also a note about Hans Zimmer's music, which is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a mixture of childish and dark feelings throughout the film. A great CD that you can get if you can. <br /> <br />
