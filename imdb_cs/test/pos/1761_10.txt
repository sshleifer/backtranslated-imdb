"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last feature-length feature film created by Max and Dave Fleischer who created the parallel Disney universe. While Disney's movies are well remembered today, both Fleischer's films "Gulliver's Travels" and this are forgotten. "Hoppity" is a charming original, not an adaptation as the first picture. This is a major plus, one would think. No, critics, seldom on the Fleischers side, started throwing it. Yes, the story is not as tight as "Gulliver," but how can you hate a film that boasts such a joy? It is filled with big music numbers and a very interesting story that would be a crime to uncover. The characters are lovely and charming and there is a heart in this movie. Fleischers really got over here and they never did. They would spend most of their time on single-engineers after they were refueled at the box office. It's a pity they didn't do any more. Who knows? Their next attempt could become a masterpiece they sought. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
