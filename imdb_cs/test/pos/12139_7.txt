I agree with all the strengths outlined in other reviews, but there are some beats that hold him firmly in the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit him to being a big drama beyond the "elements" that make up film noir - not to mention that the great filmmakers are not / cannot / should not be great dramas, but this is not. The film is used sparingly, but I would say it is used to accentuate the action more often than the elements of a woman. <br /> <br /> Great setting for this movie, by the way, with a fierce kind of endless ending that either depends on whether it is truth or wasteland. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow certain specifics. The big story turn includes children who see their mother die or it should be big. moment. But children are never shown to react in one way or another. Neither screams, nor asking his father what happened, children are good actors and father's reactions, I suppose it matters, but that's a big mistake. This is the heart of the story, and children are mostly empty in their response. They really have nothing, and in the next scene they look like nothing has happened. Similarly, there is a link between Belmond and Ventura. Belmondo says he knew a partner who was killed - but that is never explained and has no significant impact on Belmond or anyone else. Belmondo's romantic subplot also weighs on credibility, even though it has been convincing. Ventura's character simply allows Belmond to include an entirely stranger in their escape plan. He doesn't even comment or seem to notice. Another gap. The end of the movie and I won't spoil it, the end takes place off the screen with a perfect voice that tells you what happened. I think it's trying to make him feel more true to life, but again like these other wrong steps he leaves the drama off the screen. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not addressing these questions? I do not know, apart from the fact that the film's goals were limited to the audience getting what it wanted from a criminal by melodrama - design some deeper elements and then ignore them. Too bad there is a lot to recommend this movie, Ventura is very very good, but too bad it could be a great drama as well as a crime story - like with IMDb's favorite movie of all time THE GODFATHER. This film had the potential. It would make a good remake if there were more problems in the US, but it would probably be a forfeiture of the movie, but it would be a good remake in the hands of the right director, though it is doubtful that Ventura's performance can be overcome. So it's worth seeing, but frustrating as a whole
