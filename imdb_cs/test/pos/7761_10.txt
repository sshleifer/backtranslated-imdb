Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very valuable anime in almost every page you find on the web. So I really wanted to know why, and I was something other than disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you can get past a very bizarre (but rather funny) first episode, you'll find yourself in a very funny and very special world. Very well drawn, perfectly animated world, it is. I can't say much of the story without messing it up, so I'll say it's a college comedy ... and it's not yet. I can't say what it really is, really. Seriously, I'm a huge anime fan and I have about 50 full series, and I'm not kidding when I say it, even though I'm not Haruhi Suzumiya, it's really in a very high position in my personal collection . I fell in love with this at first glance, and I assure you that at least you will not be indifferent to his irresistible charm. Believe me, I'm not around giving 10 for every thing I'm watching.
