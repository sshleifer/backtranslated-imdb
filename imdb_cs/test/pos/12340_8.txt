ONE Dark Night is a very overlooked and little-known film from the early 1980s that deserves an audience that is afraid it will never get, and that's a damnation. I have seen this movie compared to others who have over the years got a bigger name, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. It is a much different film than you and I do not see a comparison other than a mausoleum that is somewhat similar to what is in PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this slipped without wider acceptance. Maybe it's all in marketing, I don't know. Maybe he would breathe a new life into it, unless Raymar let go of it all his life. I'm not too big for all the remakes that are abundant these days, but I think they work with lesser-known movies (except for the scary remake of GHOST SHIP, which was different from the opening scene and Mudvayne Not Falling blaring). crap). So if ONE Dark Night's remake got into the right hands, I think a lot of people would go and watch the original. I know what I'm doing is where there's a remake of a movie I haven't seen before. I'm afraid anything that wouldn't be a remake wouldn't bring this movie back to life. Of course, if Raymar didn't see his eyes. Anyway ONE Dark night is for horror fans, especially the horror fans of the 80s (because we all know the best horror movies were). Spooky environment. Quite a good deal. Very good story. Campy. What more can you want from the early 1980s? What is ... nudity and gore? I'm sorry. No nudity or gore in this movie, but it's still great! Fixed 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
