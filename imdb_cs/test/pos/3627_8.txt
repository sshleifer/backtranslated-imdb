The sub-genre of the "old dark house", which dominated early talks, rarely disappoints when we look back at old times. Here's the one that provides so many suspicious characters that you have to think about as they will be able to make all the free ends in a 6-cylindrical run of time. Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to avenge Col. Walters (Berton Churchill), who sent one of his ranks to jail. They decide to die that night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is committed to protecting it at all costs. Thelma (Irene Purcell), the fianc√© of the club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, late from the mega-budgeted HELL'S ANGELS (1930)), who wants to leave him and stop threatening her life, doesn't fit well. The brand promises to resign after the colonel's life is saved. Everyone is heading to Walters' newly acquired Long Island headquarters to wait for the killer. Colonel might be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it's an old dark house with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton). local hermit) and perhaps even the spirit. The best billed Zasu Pitts is Nora, a housekeeper who expects to see the spirit behind every corner. Throwing a cop (James Gleason) who is sure Brand is a criminal and we have a picture that is full of actions and surprises. You'll notice right away that the screenwriter was embarrassed to come up with too much dialogue because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) Hindu mystic (whose films of that time were loaded) says: "Evil is on the way." I have lost many times, as Mrs. Pitts often says, "Someone's going to happen!" There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the stereotypical stupid cop and Roscoe Karns as Mr. Lyon's friend) who serve as a comedy relief. The house itself is suitably scary looking (in fact, I think the same set was used in PHANTOM (1931)) with lots of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but somehow you never get a sense of danger. Maybe it's because no one in the movie, and I don't mean anyone!, Is exactly what it seems to be. In the end it all comes out right; but going into some detail would ruin it for you. Watch out for Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Capt. Engelhorn by KING KONG) to jump out of the suspects. CROOKED CIRCLE is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable, and then several others are not. I suspect you will like it.
