Adopted is a 2006 teen movie that stars a guy from mac and pc ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. He gets a guy who turned down all the colleges he asked for, so he decides to make his own college and invite all the other people who haven't, the problem is hundreds of people who sign up for their school. The movie is merry and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 per sale and I always watched it. Overall, this movie needs to be watched for fans of all comedies as it's funny, funny and just a good movie all up. I rate this movie very 78%. GO ACCEPT SEQUEL GUYS, MAKE SURE CRAP IS NOT.
