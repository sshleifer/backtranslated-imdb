Being a fan of storytimes, I was surprised that there was no device that sent the character of Russell Johnson over time. He only appeared in 1865. It was a disappointing part of the episode. I enjoyed the assumptions of the risk of "changing" the future by changing the past. Other episodes of the Twilight Zone about time travel, such as "No Time Like The Past", "Once Upon A Time", etc., were in my opinion more appropriate for using devices "travel by time". Maybe if Russell Johnson's character was the same as he played in "Execution," it would be more acceptable to fans than I was. As science fiction fans know, no characters have ever had to die in time episodes of travel. In these types of stories, all kinds of "twists" plot can be used. That was the only mistake I could comment on for this episode.
