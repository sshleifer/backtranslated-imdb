This must be one of Denmark's most entertaining movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are cheerful as they drive through Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he manages to play crazy in a very reasonable way. But if you don't understand Danish (don't mean your pastry here), don't waste your time on it? I don't think it works with headlines.
