Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film in 1999 at the Gothenburg Film Festival. When I was extremely tired in the evening, I hesitated to see it, but the total score of 9 on IMDB brought me there. It was 80 minutes of pure life force! It was charming to experience Dieter Dengler's life through his own narrative. <br /> <br /> KNOW! And if possible ... see it in the cinema!
