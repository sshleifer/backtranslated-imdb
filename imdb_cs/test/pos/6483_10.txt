I think it's the kind of movie that you either love or hate, and I'm really not the type that could go to art films. My mother rented a "mullhuland DR" the second night and I almost escaped from the room, ha. But I like this movie. <br /> <br /> One night we recorded "The Beat" when we just let the tape run and got such a great movie by accident. He saved the tape and watched it a lot. Finally, I got VHS added to my collection. I watched it many times and copied poems in one place. I even tried to shape one scene for my high school. She said we could do any scene we wanted and cut out the wrong words. She refused to do it to me. If it could upset my teacher drama, it must be a lot of good :) Honest never treated me the same way. I liked what happened very true and honest. It wasn't clean and polished, but it was better. It was a true life, as someone would actually behave and not show the emotions that Hollywood does. It was great, especially when they played Rex. The story was original. Not only do the characters get into their world, but also. He is not your typical person who would meet children in the inner city and save them through the knowledge film at all. Simply caring and friendship make things a little better. The only thing is that even in the 1980s there was more violence in arms and less simple things like throwing rock, but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt. film. I think he has to see it. Either you will love or hate it, but however it will have an impact, and this is a good movie that you will remember and talk about later.
