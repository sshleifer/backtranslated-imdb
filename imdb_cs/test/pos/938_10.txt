It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious testament to THREE COLORS: RED without letting people introduce themselves to the thoughts Krysztoff Kieszlowski explored in the previous two entries of this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think about them and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more connected than we want to think ourselves, and all we need is a little hand of destiny setting some events in motion. At BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without a connection to the past met her with an unexpected. In WHITE, the act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between the two men who will, against the chance, conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and obvious coincidences coincide with the meeting of the young Genevese model and the retired judge, who has a habit of looking into the lives of other people. This young girl is suitably named: Valentine (luminous Irene Jacob) who has this glow about her and even smiles openly while working on the track. Not that she was without a baggage: she has a friend, an invisible, who also demands that she knows what she is doing at all times, has a brother who troubles her, and rejects the photographer's advances in her image for a huge billboard. She hits the dog while driving and sisters her back to health, but when she takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he doesn't want her. "I want nothing," he said coldly, and the BLUE elements suddenly appear as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparently free freedom, supervising unsuspecting people. This masculine version of Juliette Binoche's character at Valentine's Day - says he can only feel compassion for him when he leaves in horror, but coincidence has a place in his place, and here he is when he starts to discover who he is and his big loss. At the same time, Kieszlowski is developing a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who is about to become a judge and who lives directly across Europe. streets from Valentine's Day - but they keep each other together. Chance is a word. Like Valentine, he won the jackpot on the food story he attends, elements of coincidence peppering her life and Auguste. She has a girlfriend who also provides people with weather reports. One of them is an old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste and has never met her. Like God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that bursts the walls of this present state of consensus and brings a new meaning to "Meet again". It is this parallelism between an old and a young judge who makes RED so beautiful and transcendent because time is actually much more fluid than we would like to consider. There are people we meet in life that if we were born in similar time frames, there would be many things. This is the case with Valentine's Day and the Old Judge. I believe there is certainly a strong brotherhood of souls that unites them into close ties: it is a woman he has not met - by chance or not - and whether he knows it or not, he tries to change so he puts himself at great risk of revealing and will become a social outcast. But it doesn't stop there. One of the many links between the three films is the character of an old woman who goes to a large garbage container. Where Julie didn't see her (and didn't help her anyway), and Karol fresh out of her public humiliation, smiling at her, "Someone's worse than me," Valentine's Day helps her. Fragility in need can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a small way. Now RED is much more than a story. Valentine's Day, Old Judge, Auguste, Even Rita Dog: These are not characters limited by narration. The American version would destroy the idea and commercialize random encounters and even cause a stupid ending. RED is thus a simple, straightforward conspiracy that any of these people could become anything, and the possibilities that this story could turn away in many ways were not a critical element at the crucial moment. > <br /> Adding to the notion of characters that mirror each other despite timeframes or places is a theme of sexual betrayal. It is also important and character defining element in all three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays Olivier when it's clear she is emotionally dead. Dominique listened to her moans on the phone in WHITE (which became an important device in RED) when she has sex with a man, while on the Brigite Bardot billboard she is CONTEMPT. In RED, the story of love and betrayal of an old judge will be re-released. And all the while, a Valentine's Billboard picture is rolling over them as a resolution of what is to come at the same time when Rita, a dog Valentine's car hit, carries seven cubs. care and love. Why do I say six? You'll have to watch the movie and the div.
