Planktonrules comments had to be written on Topsy-Turvy Day because all that is mentioned in this simple form of life is the opposite of the true truth! 'Bluebeard Eighth Wife' is jolly in every scene, in every way - chemistry between Colbert and Cooper couldn't be more subtle ... the supportive cast is excellent. <br /> <br /> Writing and direction are wonderful !!! Like many other comments on this board, I lament again: "Why can't movies be like that anymore?" This is the classic Paramount 1930 comedy that is best for everyone, people!
