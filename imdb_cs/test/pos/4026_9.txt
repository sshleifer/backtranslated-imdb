Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young lady, lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference in being entirely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take steps to access this strange man, Massimo, and at the same time fear that allows her to answer only "yes", "no" or "don't know" questions. The road to the accent of loneliness is spectacular. An example would be the distance between Massimo and Valeria, which takes coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and unnoticed. I could mention a few sequences, but it's better to see the movie. It's amazing to watch that the director doesn't look in one detail. Although all actions are performed in slow motion, no screams are necessary, nor special effects, but just great gameplay and a moving well written story. I loved it.
