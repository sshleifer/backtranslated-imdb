For those who remember the initial impact of this video, they will never forget it and viewing Thriller is all that is needed to make you feel again for twelve years. But even though it's a great video, it's not perfect, though it seemed like it was at the time. When this video came out for the first time, nobody has ever seen such a thing before. Now the music video medium has grown by leaps and bounds, and a new Thriller review reveals its errors. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson walks alongside a girl after they leave the cinema, she sings all the verses of the song and skips the choirs. After becoming a zombie when it comes time to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the choir again, and again, and again, as if to replace his previous absence. This could be the first time a song was deconstructed at any time to fit into a visual in a music video, but it wasn't the last time. The problem at the age of MTV remains. The best videos like Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It used visuals to serve music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is a great fun and absolute necessity for Halloween.
