This show is my fault happy! When I first tuned in to the American Top Top model, I was expecting to be bored and very stupid. No. This show is actually a real fun. I read on one of the other reviews that you are wondering if you have what it takes to be another American top model. And that's it! Who doesn't like the glamor and excitement that comes with being a model? At ANTM you will see what you really like. And who doesn't love to hear girls whore about themselves and get into the fighting? Or do you want to throw something in that lady Janice? Give it a chance. Don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look at in a life lesson. Enjoy what it is. Serious fun!
