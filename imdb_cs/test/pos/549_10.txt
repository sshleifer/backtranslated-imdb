Last night I saw "Anywhere But Here" as a preview. I loved the movie! I was drawn to this because of the realistic portrayal of the mother / daughter relationship ... between Adele and Ann was definitely a connection. I think this is a great deal of performance by Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actress who portrayed Adele, and after leaving the theater I couldn't think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to a role I don't think any other teenage actress could. I think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate Saranden and Portman for "Actress" and "Supporting Actress". It would be a shame if they were overlooked.
