This film is by George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg at her hottest, and of course Paddy Chaevsky writing at the "masterpiece" warp! There are also very short excerpts from future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing etc. Who have one scene lines that you don't necessarily have to spot until your fifth or sixth tracking time. Nancy Marchand as a young middle and middle age trainer nurse is also great, just like virtually every "face" in Hollywood 1970. <br /> <br /> It's one of the few movies that get better when you see more. it. Watch the "Surprise" scene ala "Wait for Dark"! This is one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. It's great.
