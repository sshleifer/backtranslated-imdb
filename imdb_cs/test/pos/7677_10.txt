I saw this movie when I was very young. This is my favorite time. Until recently, I couldn't get a copy and view it brought so many pleasant memories. I loved the portrayal of Porgy, his character with such strength and courage. The part of Pearl Bailey, though small, was not unlike many of our family members. My favorite songs were and still are "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, don't let me handle it" and of course "Summertime". According to the instructions, if I interpret them correctly, I cannot send where I was able to get my copy. That's why I signed up to share this information. They will not be published before you sign up for instructions. <br /> <br /> Phone numbers, mailing addresses, URLs. Availability, price or order / dispatch information.
