I was surprised when I watched this movie "caught me". No actors acted like typical 'Hollywood' actors, but it's not always bad as this movie proves. Different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing move without limits! They also give you a taste for what it was, without being "educational." A movie that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people love to argue about 'accuracy' in any film of this type, but just getting a basic idea has a lot to offer. Moderate gripe; To the east and west of Germany, on any map, West Germany would have to the left, east to the right. The movie sometimes sets you a little, because about half of the scenes have western Germany on the right side of the screen and another on the left. They also move back and forth during the same events. Perhaps a little more consistency would avoid this slight distraction. Go See It!
