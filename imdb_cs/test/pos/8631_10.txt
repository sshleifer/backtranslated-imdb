Although a copy of this movie is hard to find if you can find it, get it! !!! I believe it was, apart from In The Navy, the only Abbott and Costello musical. Although a bit of a conspiracy, (I have never heard the butcher's version go with him), you still enjoy the antiquity of a slightly idiotic but dear Jack and greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepuss. Slightly reminiscent of DuBarry Was and Lady, this exciting film will roll you down the floor - just get up and dance like Lou Costello sings. (I don't know why they didn't do it in other movies.)
