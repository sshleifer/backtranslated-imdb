This film does not have the excellent visuals that American beauty or the ice storm has offered, and since it was made after these films, it cannot even be referred to as very original: the music, though gently brilliant, sounds very much like American Beauty. The story has some similarities to the ice storm, especially (as well as Sigourney Weaver). It seems that the film does not intend to re-create the success of both of these films. The story is sometimes a bit shallower than the larger, more successful "brothers" by doing too much, or by not leading to the most effective dialogues. Here, writing can't measure it with American beauty. But that can be said of most of the films that have ever been made, even the best, and there's still a lot to be liked: the music score and (expected, due to cast) effective performances. It is worth noting Emile Hirsch, who would be a few years later shining in the excellent "Into The Wild". Overall, I can recommend this movie if you like suburban dramas, even if it's not the first on the must-see list that would end: 1 American Beauty 2 Ice Storm 3 Little Kids. <br /> <br /> After you've seen and liked it, look at this one.
