He had never written anything here before, but after watching Noroi, I felt that I had to write my thoughts about it. Don't compare it to Blair Witch first, this film deserves much better than that! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). I really liked the way the movie doesn't look like a standard horror movie, but as a documentary made by a reporter (I think) named Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without much care about the plot, I can say that he starts with Kobayashi, who is doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that have been shown to be associated with something much darker and more sinister. The story doesn't have to be so original in itself, which really impressed me on Noroi was an incredibly frightening atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap fears and jumping scenes, this movie may not be for you. This film is about the mood it presents, with scary images and a general sense of pre-sense tension. Making a documentary style makes the farm more credible. <br /> <br /> This is also a lot of help acting, which is excellent, though not ideal for the general part of the movie! Much better than most other films in this type of genre. I recite well enough, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, it's a thrilling, scary, well-behaved and first movie that scared me at age.
