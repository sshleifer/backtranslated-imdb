I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first live action version of classic comics. Like comics, the film is full of jokes based on puns, anachronistic jokes, and grotesque logs that rarely fall flat. Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use battle elixir to fight Roman legions in their native Gaul. Here they will end up in Egypt and help a friend to build Cesar's Palace (yes his slavery) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. The reason I took it was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. He's good, but the role is a little more than a portrait. However, even though she is rarely in the movie I didn't care because he was so smart and jokes so funny I was in hysterics. I loved it. I loved it so much that I can't understand why movies have never been released in the United States. <br /> <br /> Importing a DVD has a movie in English Oak, which is quite good, especially when you think that when you look at it in a longer French version, puns (and hence jokes) are not always clear because auditory, so if you read the names that are bad, the jokes are lost. Most jokes between the full French version and the shorter English oak appear to be exactly the same, although some have sometimes been changed for the better and sometimes for the worse. Personally, I'll stick to the oak when I watch it again, because it's easier to pick up jokes and enjoy humor. <br /> <br /> You really want to see it when you like puns and low eyebrows but clever humor That's great comedy
