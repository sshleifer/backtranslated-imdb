There were a lot of stupid teenagers who received 80s sex movies and a lot of slasher flicks, but there was only a handful that was made with thought, made you laugh and captured the correct time period; it was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so Forman, who has vanished from her bio unfortuatley from Hollywood. I'd like to see it on a DVD with a special version of Cage and Forman. Let's recall it. Ever wanted to plan a real 80's film weekend, rent it, Sure Thing and 16 candles and a breakfast club. This will take you back to the "Totally Rad" time that seemed at that time was much easier. Memo to studios: Time to Release DVD!
