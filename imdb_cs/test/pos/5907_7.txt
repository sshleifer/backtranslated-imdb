I saw Jimmy Stewart in all common roles, but "Spirit of St. Louis" was reported as one of his favorites. This film, which was released at the time of release, was largely forgotten. Telling the well-known story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, Stewart seems to be poorly miss-cast initially, and his well-known voice never allows you to forget who you are watching; it looks like George Baily again. But Stewart seems to have worked hard on the role and does everything right, so long ago he doesn't care that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he was displaying. Stewart's Lindberg is such a gosh-darn, American, apple pie that you find yourself in the story, and you realize that Stewart intended to display Lindberg with all the aw-shucks, Yankee-know-how he could gather up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the US, and Stewart seems determined to stick to his appearance. Flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a somewhat boring story that moves on, and I've been hit by subtle references to the faith that have been scattered in the movie; Lindberg is trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted by a priest on his faith, or Lindberg refuses to carry a decorated St. Wenceslas medal. after crossing the Atlantic. For me, it is a film not about the epic journey of man into the unknown, but about his awareness that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel.
