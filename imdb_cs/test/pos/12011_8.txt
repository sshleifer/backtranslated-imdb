I think this film has become an important record of the worst aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protective wall. It is a document of despair and courage that you must not miss. However, I would like to comment on the current location of this leak. This did not happen either in Berlin or in its surroundings, as some respondents had expected, and it was nothing to do with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon flew over the Iron Curtain, which not only divided Germany, but at that time divided the whole of Europe. The balloon took off from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew 14 miles to Naily in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later this year. While the balloon flight created a fun thrilling cinema, it should remain a memory of those who lost their lives trying to escape from East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states.
