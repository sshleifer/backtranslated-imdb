Tom Garner's story opens with his great funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks told by his loyal lifelong friend Henry. Henry and his wife are debating whether Tom was a great man and a genius or a totally worthless villain. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it. Tom was a wonderfully wealthy and successful owner of a large railway that dominated his board and his competition, terrorizing his staff, defeating the shooters. Tom's ambitious wife Sally was responsible for all Tom's successes. When he met her, he was illiterate and happy with his job as a trackwalker for rail. Sally teaches him to read and take his tracking work when Tom goes to school. He starts to climb one step in time over the railway until he finally takes over as president. But as Tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to Sally is gradually decreasing. His corrupt son despises him and he takes up a much younger woman (aptly named Eve) with predictable catastrophic consequences. Tom is a complete success in his business life; in his personal life, catastrophic failure. Like the Hearst character in "Citizen Kane," Tom symbolizes the best and worst of the capitalist system. Spencer Tracy is amazing in the role of Tom Garner and the business scene with an authentic circle. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; Both of them age beautifully in a multi-generation story. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but there is nothing like comedy Sturges made famous for.
