No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can't deny that this video is the most unique video ever. There is no other video that would be remotely close to "Thriller". Now I'm watching it with a smile, because now I can appreciate the miracle it is. I like this video and it will be as long as there are music videos. I think everyone should sit down and look at it when it's on the spot and see how great it was, especially for 1983.
