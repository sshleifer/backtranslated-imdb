"News Broadcasting" is directed by James L. Brooks (claims to Endearment, as Good As It Gets) and has a large cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. Everyone is doing good, but they're too unlikble to really care for them. Some parts of the movie are really brilliant, such as the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it doesn't work is a movie that relies on characters being fun rather than fun things happening to them. You could think of it as nothing but a drama, but it's often too stupid to be successful there. However, the scenario is worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
