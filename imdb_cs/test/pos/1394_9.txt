action packed, with my favorite type of creature. I'm not going to give any of it away if you haven't seen it because it's worth taking the time to sit down and decipher the secrets of things as mentioned in this movie. sometimes slowly and those were the moments that occurred to me what was going on easily, but damp, that it excited me quietly, where you hold it in your head instead of letting it turn off, probably the mood in which I was at that time . Effects and action sequences that you might feel formed for occasional lulls.Of Of course there is a duschload of movies out there exactly like this, the movie still has its own style and taste that I respect from underground independent horror movies as well.
