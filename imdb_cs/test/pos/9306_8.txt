The fat man and the little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How it happened and happened in American hands is the story of this movie. By the way, terms are the code names of two plutonium and uranium-powered bombs. Fat Man was a plutonium bomb and the one was dropped on Nagasaki and the little boy was one used on Hiroshima <br /> <br /> The film is primarily a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army and physicist J Robert Oppenheimer who led the team scientists who developed a bomb under Groves' direction. With two men from such a different environment as these, the conflict was inevitable. Paul Newman, who has been a disarming activist throughout his life, plays General Groves. To his merit, Newman does not play a man whose views have little to do with him, like any kind of cartoon. Groves is a military man primarily with technical background. He wanted combat command, because trained military professionals would naturally want this war. But because of his background in engineering, Groves was in the lead of the Manhattan Project, which was what the effort called it. Whatever it is, Newman is determined to contribute to counting the war effort. Most of us first met Dwight Schultz of the A-team as H.M. Pilot Murdoch, whose grasp of reality is at best unclear. If only the A team were to meet, he might think that Schultz had a great future in comic roles. Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an amazing range. dramatic parts since he left the TV series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of this problem also fascinates him. Later, Oppenheimer got into a real bond because of his leftist political views and collaborators, who all knew they were going to the Manhattan Project. Some of the smaller roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Communist mistress of Oppenheimer, whose relationship with Oppenheimer later got him into such a jackpot and Laura Dern as nurse instead of Los Alamos. But best is John Cusack, who is Michael Merriman composed of several scientists who could be accurately identified as the first victims of the atomic age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially what's happening to him, are gaining real honesty. Fat man and baby boy represent facts and lets decide what could have happened if alternative uses were used.
