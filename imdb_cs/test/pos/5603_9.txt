While the cameraman was certainly "funky" - perhaps a Dutch short "stoned" - the film's assumption was fantastic. It really took a terribly satirical (Hal Halley traditional) look at God, Jesus and the devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides some merry scenes ... Even Jesus' monologues were great - it was by far the best Jesus I even saw. So carefree, zen-like, Son-of-God-ish, but still so nice guy. On one level, it is a very general view of paradoxes of Christianity, but there is still a personal level where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having God's complex (than Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
