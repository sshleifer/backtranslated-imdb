I saw this movie last night in Phil. Film Festival. It was an interesting and fun movie that had some cute and moving scenes. Peter Falk was excellent as well as the rest of the cast. They were believable and played their roles well. The film may be a bit long and the conclusion was fine. Viewers laughed in the right places. Family dynamics were amazing, and although it was a Jewish family, they could be Italian, Irish or others, including Greek. I recommend this movie if you are interested in laughing on a theme that is not so often addressed in this way. IOT is thinking about the consequences of your activities and how they influence others in your life and those who are not clearly in your life.
