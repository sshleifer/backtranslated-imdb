I thought it was a beautiful movie. it's not my favorite of his movies - the chungking express holds this place - this one is completely different from everything I saw him. it is slow (but not unpleasantly so) - it takes its time and reflects on the characters .. there is minimal movement in the frame - the cameraman is gorgeous. acting is great. the film feels like a long warm soothing drink.
