It's exactly what I expected of him. Relaxing, funny and fun. The actor pair was amazing as well as the scene selection. I personally recommend it. It's a kind of movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without anyone feeling uncomfortable or bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh too. And the action scenes are tasty. A classic of modern American comedy. And very well.
