This film is about Xavier, Erasmus student student from Paris, who spends one year in Barcelona. During this time, under the influence of all new impressions, it changes and grows. After returning, he has a much clearer view of his life and eventually takes him into his own hands. This is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, and it's probably because I was in a very similar situation. I'm from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is an exact representation of what the Erasmus semester will do in Spain. From what I've heard, the story is autobiographical, and that's probably why it's so realistic. Let me give you some examples (a slight warning) - Xavier shares the apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks exactly like all the Erasmus shared apartments I saw in Madrid. The main characters are nicely developed and some funny scenes are based on the usual stereotypes. The Spanish landlord is also 100% accurate. The story of Xavier and his friend Martine, who remained in Paris, is also very typical. Approximately 90% of all relationships fall apart during the Erasmus semester (or shortly thereafter). - There's a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his England roommate, who is a bit "unwavering" to go with everyone else. Finally he succeeds and Wendy probably has the night of his life. Another great thing in this movie is that it's really trilingual: Students in the apartment speak Spanish or English and Xavier speaks French with her mother and girlfriend. There are subtitles so that everyone can understand what is being said. I certainly hope that this film will not be published anywhere. I can imagine that for people who are not members of Erasmus, it's just a fun comedy, but for all my Erasmus colleagues, I can only say: This is your movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. But be prepared for some feelings of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
