One of America's most beautiful masterpieces, Morrissey opens the film with the sexualization of Dallesandro, with open mouth snoring on the pillow. We wonder if he's heroin? We only see his face, then lightning, his body, lightning, his naked ass. I can't remember another movie that would use this flash-flashing form of editing so well to create a hypnotic, drug-like mood, a method that works beautifully as both stimulation and style. After this introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent shakes - we expect to be some soft androgyne; instead, he has the voice of a street robber - Morrissey doesn't want to leave our assumptions without control. The lengthy opening is very sexy and playful - it is a combination of combat difficulties, Dallesandro's fascinating lips and early morning sexual escapades; All kinds of flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistic. What I got from it was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - it's like a 20-continuation of this story. There is a sense of camaraderie between meat sellers and buyers; when Dallesandro walks down the street looking for a man (to finance her wife's abortion), there's a sense of secret handshake as the boys trade each other. I never bored him boring, though nothing happens - nothing happens brilliantly, boys hang around as they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick Dallesandro finds is fascinating to follow, use Greek descriptions and touch only his back, the form of aesthetic worship of the body on the male part. It's also very funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, me?"). It's one of the brightest scenes in the movie - I think in every movie; surely every movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesander's eyes seem red and swollen, we can't tell if it's because he's drunk, shy, embarrassed or all. The film interviews are cut - no matter what. (The film is silent in several scenes, some of the most serious and the most beautiful you can ever experience.) But when Morrissey decides to include one, the way it involves him (we put it a little together), it's surprising, like one interview between Dallesander and the newcomer - and neither of them ever mentioned the word "gay" or "cheater". There's a scene in which we listen to a couple of transvestites as Dallesandro gets into service - just after the newcomer “explains how he got used to it”. Dallesandro is a theme that deserves attention from its clients and Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor in terms of acting as a performance, but in terms of uncovering something that is incredible - it is someone we want to feel immediately above, but we are going through his experience, with all their complexities and we are forced to try to know him. It's the kind of empty slate we're drawing on, but we can't keep on. And, of course, it is incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, this is in part evidence of the beauty of the male body, the beautiful Dallesandra's torso and the permanently erect nipples. The film has one devastating scene, but like everything else you can't really handle - the girl says she was raped, and her only self-defense is that the rapist only asked her for sex, married her, it would be better. It is broken. The film has a feeling for everyone, but even better than that, it's not just compassionate, actually trying to help us understand human beings - and without ever dictating what it is, we should be understood. He doesn't even look for people in the movie. He feels inclusive when we see Joe's hand around the transvestite. When he reads a letter (saying he doesn't get to point eight in one place), he's absolutely charming when he stops on the word ... then he says, "woteva" and goes on. From the interaction between Dallesander and one of his clients, you can learn something deeper about homosexual equality than any case study. Here we have a young boy who smiles (his upper lips disappear as he does) when a 30-year-old bunny Korean war veteran moves his fingers into his hair; it is a scene that feels very deep, this adult shares something with the younger version of himself - they are not two homosexuals together, or a homosexual who pays an equal man, it is something else you can't give a finger to; Sexuality issues are next to the point. (Never before a pimple appeared to be kind.) After they shared something with something emotionally (though with Dallesander, because he is there for money, it is never obvious why he is there, though he is never less than honest, which may be his greatest disarmament) quality, "So can you help me?" The man certainly says that. "I don't mean pants!" 10/10
