Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I think before Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a school for superheroes in training, Teenagers with super powers to help the police capture the bad guys and at other times get into embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch what was also fun, there was a live action scene called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors who expressed the characters, also dressed there have characters. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields); Love Superman and Wonder Woman) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The entire cast simply went with something when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, I am on the shore it will return in a live event like Fat Albert (2004)
