The rise of punk music was scarcely documented on the film, and most people tend to focus on the events of other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris managed to rescue the Los Angeles shot of '79 -'81, proving that the vibrant and diverse art / musical community was born to compete with others. For some of them, bands read like he is now a legendary American punk; Black flag, X, circle cracks, germs, fear. Purists argue that vital groups were dropped (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film was the cause of the onslaught of suburban and macho violence. However, the issues covered in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains incomparable and the influence is still visible and heard in today's clich√©s.
