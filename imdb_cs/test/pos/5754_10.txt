I own this movie on DVD and I watched it about ten times and it's still funny. Jokes will never get bored and I often laugh at awkward times and think about them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom Fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They are desperately in need of money and when a movie star in hiding comes to stay their happiness can only be in. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and not stand absolutely bored or disgusted, you must first like humor. Some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy it. But overall, it's a great movie.
