Killing: The film has proven to be a good shot in a well-written, well-directed and well-functioning series. Loose ends were tied that were not properly resolved at the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the film, provided a life-like view of life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with extremely high murder rates. My appeal to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but as soon as I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And he certainly did. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the show, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers for giving us a last look at the dark side of Charm City.
