I think it's a great show with cool heads and very cool action. 2 guys pretending to be women's masters, demonstrating their skills at different nightclubs, and 4 experts (picked up by the artists themselves) comment on them and choose the winners. Their jokes are fun and some participants are really fun to watch. More so, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, lots of expert comments are useful while you can see how it works in the field. Actually, I think it's one of the best TV shows, and I absolutely recommend it to all men who like women. ps / pardon for my broken engravings.
