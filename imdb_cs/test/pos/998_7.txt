With his ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on Kira's eye, this is a re-reconciliation. This relationship story with the main characters who work on balance between first and fast love in the World War II home front. Poet Dylan Thomas takes his way between his wife and ex in the dark and smoky London Blitz and later in the windy Wales. Vera is an ex and another spark from each other as a poet and a soldier becomes a side line while girls owe and share. Easy watches that work well in the bouncing era along with several declines in pace. It will work well with French subtitles, but then I may have been too many movies from art house lately.
