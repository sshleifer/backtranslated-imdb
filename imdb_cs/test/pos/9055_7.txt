Man, it's great just to see the young and restless star of Melody Thomas Scott as something other than fake Nikki Newman! The doctor with the brain no less! And super nice to see her with similar gorgeous Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! Mel plays a microbiology professor who goes to the islands with his son for spring break. he finds himself a prisoner of the island attacked by a rapidly spreading virus. Handy for her is a hunky character played by Lorenzo who has a daughter just her son's age. Mel shines, just like Lorenzo with a little overacting from a younger couple. An interesting assumption in these times of chemical and biological terrorism. Interesting vision, especially for Y&R fans.
