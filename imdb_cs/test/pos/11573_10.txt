That's probably the best movie ever made over the past five years. I always believed that making people cry is much harder than laughing at them. If you want to see 400 adults who are loudly calling in one room, check out this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most interesting fact is that in Spain everyone knows about Ramon Sampedro. I personally knew the whole story and even its end. Thus, the perfection of the film is in the way the story is told. And in this area Amenabar is a master. This movie is MUST.
