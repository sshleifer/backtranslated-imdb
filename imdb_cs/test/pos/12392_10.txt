François Truffaut, Young Jerk of "Cahiers du cinema", the main bastion of the upcoming new wave, made a great show that he hated the film and even accused him of dragging French film into mediocrity. TRANSLATION \ tTruffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already jealous of how Carné could make a huge success for the story, which sent all the right buttons of his audience and really engaged her in something important with all the pitfalls and seductiveness of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics have seen a receptive sociological analysis wrapped up in beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on Loose". After all, Carné had everything the New Wave would miss: intelligence, subtlety, humor, great talent as a narrator, great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical brilliance, the capacity for his actors to do what they did they want a good dose of good taste. By comparison, Truffaut is a provincial boredom that has nothing to say. The Tragic Remake of 50 Years of "Pride and Prejudice", French Answers to "Rebel Without a Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells the story of a dissatisfied Parisian youth who has lost his way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and non-respect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics perceived the Tsar as a moralizing slanted "elderly", while I think what happened, on the contrary, is that Carne is gay and knows something about repression, he felt incredibly sympathetic to the young iconoclasts in his story. Aside from being a French film, there is no doubt that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that has yet to be decoded in American movies like "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Wild". Tsar young people are absolutely beautiful, elegant, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. He drives the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of their suits, dresses and duffle-coats was the highlight of the fashion of the last century. Their hairstyles are still plastered on the wall of a local hairdresser. Their body shape, which they have achieved and maintained effortlessly, is still a modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. Do they know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love? even though the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined and live by gang code and their own ruthless rituals that exclude sentiment and sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice versa. The events described in this film have, after a long time in France, given many languages ​​about youth immorality and nihilism, and at the same time have made it a huge public and critical success. This film is so stylish and it's amazing, I think older viewers who wished they wanted to be like people in the movie, and a few young filmmakers or emerging filmmakers like Truffaut, he developed a bad case of jaundice that would reflect how they could never imagine a movie as sexy or popular as this one, though it would be very good to eventually focus on nihilistic pieces. On the other hand, given the certain cliché of the scenario aspect (a love misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency), one can only wonder about the horribly devout and puritan mishmash that the Americans would make of the same basic scenario if they dared to solve the problem. he was shot in the same basic positions as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored his tragic and ironic dimension. Check out this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
