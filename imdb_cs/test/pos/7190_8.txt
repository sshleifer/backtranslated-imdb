I don't know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to current events that I am amazed to have more and more options, such as an architect who can never correctly tell the name of the Miraculix guide. It happens as Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. Like the word "utenriks", many translations do not make any sense in English and probably not in French, so translators have to make their own jokes, and so well. Of course they have a very good foundation on which to build, with a film that is just comical from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with good translation!
