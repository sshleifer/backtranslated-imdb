What I liked about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feeling it gives in the early 1940s. These are songs, clothes, automobiles, daytime jargon buildings, etc. You feel like you are back in time. From reading some reviews, I see it was hard - a movie that was released a few days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wow, no one would be interested in going to movies for a full-length cartoon during those busy and shocking days, I'm sure. It is a pity that people have missed some nice animation that would have been astonishing at that time, almost 70 years ago. The colors are nice, the drawings are good and the story includes how we root for the mistakes led by "Hoppity" and his beautiful girl "Honey" to make it happily-ever-after and off the road. It's also about the fact that everyone will find the grassy area they can live on, and don't worry about the people who trample on them. There's an ugly thief - "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his followers. Those assistants ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, Mosquito") are Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is known where an ugly old man wants to marry a sweet young thing and uses ruthless means to help her. The good one, in the meantime, has a stack stacked up against him, but of course he wins at the very end. My favorite part - it will sound worse than what it was - when a good guy "Hoppity" was temporarily hit by electric shock and danced in black and white. "That was a fantastic animation! <br /> < You know, it's good that I didn't see it as a very young child; I would be afraid to play outside and squash all the nice people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass under your feet!
