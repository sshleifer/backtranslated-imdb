I have to tell you I'm a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a kid. Well, sometimes I gave a friend some episodes of DS9 and asked him <br /> <br /> "hey, man you've been watching since I watched all the TNG episodes," he said. "Well, I have those Farscape episodes." I said, "Ok, let me give it a try" I was pretty sure I was so happy because I was just finalizing TNG tracking and found it great. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, viewed by you, but the show didn't impress me much, I found it childish initially and I thought it was just another TV show, nice adventures, but regular music was a bit different, elegant and special effects, and I had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched 3 more episodes that 3 eps was not enough to do to understand that I like or not A good understanding of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton ... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> I think I mostly like the freedom of characters in the context of the event Unlike Star Trek, where everyone slept when they were supposed to do and too many high tech bullshits. <br /> <br /> The show improved with every episode, very interesting with the tory line ..... what can I say this film is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend !!!
