When I first saw this movie, I also expected "our boys" to be cute, and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't get it then. But, a few years later, at a party, later in the 1970s, PAR-TAY, where certain substances were smoked, inhaled and with plenty of tequila, "HEAD" was late at night. realized what the "HEAD" is about. It spoofed their own show, as shown in one song that called itself, "Made Picture". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiom, "They Made Me a Monkey", openly admits that everyone in the movie was up all night weed smoking. Great movie! Tho, like a 52 year old grandmother, I've already "induldge", I'm still watching this movie when I want a good LOL!
