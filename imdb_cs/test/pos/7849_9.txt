The Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood movies I didn't see until I gave DVDs today. And from the fact that I started a sepia shot for a Macaroni climax, I was absolutely fascinated. Too many filmmakers are replacing special effects, quick editing, and dizzying camera work instead of character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to achieve maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are believable and compelling. The story relates to a lady who completes a school that is on the edge of various skirmishes during the American Civil War. In the south, the ladies supporting will find a poorly wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); He treats him back to health and begins to manipulate sexual frustrated women for his own goals. Geraldine Page is excellent as a secretary and her descent into madness is subtly mediated. He never loses visual interest for a film that takes place in one place. There is even a chance that a normal status quo may be returned, long abandoned when Eastwood's machinations are revealed; but mistresses and pupils descend on the darker road ... <br /> <br /> This is a completely different film style from the same director Dirty Harry, which was produced in the same year, and yet both are just as great. Eastwood is a great game against its usual stoic anti-heroic image, but its character is also associated with mysterious quality. Before his imprisonment, we will never know much about him and the viewer can decide on his well-shadowed personality. A villain or a victim? Whatever you think I really enjoyed.
