If you are looking for a modern movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous, white safari guides or cunning, black tribes, while saving the animal kingdom, this is not a movie for you. This is the depiction of Tarzan "legend" from its beginning in intelligent, adult terms. It's beautifully filmed and true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Tarzan is no action hero, but a man torn between two worlds - natural and civilized. Christopher Lambert captures this anxiety with absolute realism in an amazing performance. If it slips only once when the cat is out of the bag: viewers (especially the adult audience on the film) will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip. It falls into the deep depths. But Lambert will never allow it. (Forget what you might think of him in other films; when I saw this movie in the theater on its original version, I thought he deserved an academic award.) <br /> <br /> The support cast is evenly distributed excellent, other commentators have noted. I do not agree with most of them that I have found nothing wrong with Andie McDowell's performance. I wouldn't want to nominate her for an academic award - the role is unpretentious - but he's alone on her own, like she is. I don't know why her voice was exaggerated, either. The cinematography of the African story segment is absolutely beautiful. It captures both the beauty of African wilderness and exotic expectations in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is fresh and exotic and the colors are vibrant. But it is also a "period" film and the cinema also beautifully displays Victorian England - the landscape, the city and the interiors. Costumes are excellent. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or distracting. There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but not more intrusive than several scenes in wolf dancing. It is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personified in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
