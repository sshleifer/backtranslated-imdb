This is an original work. I always enjoyed Liev Schreiber as an "actor", but now one has to appreciate a multidimensional level. How did he get to the field of sunflowers? It was computer, it certainly looked real. And how did your dog audition know you would have such a performance? Does the Academy have an animal category? I think what I'm saying is that I really enjoyed this unpredictable, unconventional, little indie movie. Out of an excellent cast (one would never know Eugene Hutz was not for the actor) for the cameraman (some beautiful shots) music (he bought a CD when leaving the theater) and of course two "D" (direction and DOG). All in all "10". <br /> <br /> /
