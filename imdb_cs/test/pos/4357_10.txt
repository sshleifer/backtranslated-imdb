The issue of realism is always emerging with documentary films. How much of the movie is real and how much does the film producer handle it? In LITTLE DIETER he needs FLY, Herzog is too absorbed in telling the story of a man who tells his own story to even address the issue of realism versus formalism. Herzog's role as narrator is obvious from the beginning. Fortunately, he is the storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the best, most interesting documentary I've ever seen. Dieter's story is fascinating, and Herzog's pursuit of reenactment, giving Dieter the pace of experiencing his story in place while being filmed, is very effective. The story Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is a pervasive, persistent absurd commentary on realism. This film is to be seen for all students of documentary and / or Werner Herzog.
