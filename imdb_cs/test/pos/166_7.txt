The story of three eclipses (perhaps Indigo, ha) children begin their love of murder. Oh, and people who are "hot" on their way. Bloody Birthday, pretty average movie title, was a nice surprise. In no way did I expect a film to deal with children of bloodthirsty psychopaths. And I can say that it's also one of the best movies I've seen with kids as villains. By the end of the movie, I really wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion. It's really a solid 80s horror movie, but how these kids get away with this chaos and murder is just something you can't think about. Even the slightest investigation would easily reveal these lil sh! Ts as murderers. But there seems to be only a few policemen in the city, only one in the end, and it seemed like a demon, so I think they could get away with it. Haha, yeah, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot. However, this movie brought some evilass kids that were more than fun, lots of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. No kiddin! If you are postponed less than a stellar title, dash out your mind and give this movie a shot. It is a highly recommended and underrated horror horror of the 1980s.
