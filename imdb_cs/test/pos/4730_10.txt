After reading this document, I rented it and watched it with my teenage children. It was incredibly well-balanced, showing each party's perspective and leaving many unanswered questions. That's how it should be. I am not following a document that should tell me what to think. I look to learn and draw my own conclusions. Then we went on a trip to Waco and visited Branžské Davidiany on the place of fire. This was a powerful lesson when you saw yourself. And that led home to the basic foundation of honesty for "Waco: Rules of Engagement." If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
