Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he relaxes and postpones his maudlinic approach to drama. He can revive Barry Levinson's usual restrained stimulation, and there are times when he really shines in this film. As a humorous elected American president in "Man of the Year", Williams once again captured the merriment and sedition associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and sympathy. Here is a person who can touch the audience, but really loves them. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet it is catarrh. This is what makes it very attractive to people in film and in real life. Laura Linney re-portrays a smart woman in need. She is a wonderful and very talented performer, but I think she got into a stereotype and it would unfortunately be more interesting to have a less recognizable artist in this case. Walken largely goes through his ungrateful role, and the climate scene in the SNL parody barely floats above the water. Go for a few moments and they're priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some of the deep moments that are slowing this otherwise funny movie.
