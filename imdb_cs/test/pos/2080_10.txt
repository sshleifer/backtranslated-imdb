I saw various Hamlets and taught the game. When I look at Jacobi, I am tempted to think that everyone is as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is every nuance of this character's joke. Deeper than it solves, every riddle about Hamlet's character. Shining along the line, followed by word by word, shining light into this sparkling mind. But at the same time, we cowered at the horror that Hamlet feels in his betrayal - much more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels more pain than anyone. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayal because Jacobi is not afraid of the basals Hamlet can descend. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet in its entirety and Hamlet is the greatest figure in literature. That's why I'm satisfied that Jacobi Hamlet is the best performer.
