"Joe" is one of those movies where, even if you think it might go smoothly, it ends up hitting like ... I can't come up with an analogy. Not only has the American long-term idea of ​​unity been debatable, but also various aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is a perfect flower child, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a pure executive manager. One day Bill accidentally kills Melissa's friend. In the immediate aftermath, Bill gets to know Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right rightist, angrily racist, stiff. As a result, both of them are becoming more and more associated with the hippies that Bill finds uncomfortable, and Joe totally hates them. But in the end, everything has serious consequences. It is true that some parts of the film are somewhat dated, but it is a good combination of two sides of America during the Vietnam War. And be sure that the residual effects of everything you probably never will disappear.
