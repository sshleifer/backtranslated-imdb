There is not much about this movie who could say that the plot is quite simple: Two policemen (who also become lovers) use the mess as a prospect to catch criminals, with the help of a house lady ", played hardcore pornstar Chloe. , there are a few twists and some blurry alliances, but writing was just horrible, even for softcore movie. <br /> <br /> I've read a few previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (playing a female cop). I understand I have placed it. I did some sniffing around ... I think he's from Germany, that's why her strange sound. She makes an impression without speaking, however ... she has a great looking body . <br /> <br /> There was a couple of "behind" sex scenes in this movie that were pretty graphic for softcore film. ... excellent work. The three-way scene to the end wasn't bad. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew the female police would turn into a part-time girl at the end. She liked her three way way too much. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I won't care much about the story because it's a low budget, direct video streaming. It seems, however, that I have seen too many films with a similar type of action in this genre. Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were fine as eye candy) Gender: B + (scenes were a bit short but good) Story: C (recycled land, but whatever?) Overall: B-
