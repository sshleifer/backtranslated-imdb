2002 is Bourne Identity one of my favorite movies. however, many book fans complained that the film had very little to do with the book's storyline. Assignment is a real deal. It's strange that nobody mentioned the film at all about "Bourne Identity". (Well, I did it.) <br /> <br /> In addition to a great plot, I personally found this movie as good as any spy movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne <br /> <br /> Identity alone. The action is absolutely realistic. I especially liked the training regime of the protagonists, who was very imaginative. Feeling dark and daring. There are some surprising twists. Behavior is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can't recommend this movie enough.
