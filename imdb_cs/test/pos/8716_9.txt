I have to agree with all the previous commentators - that's just the best of all the frothy comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe ever was, and certainly with a nicer face (maybe it's less mystic, but see how Marilyn paid for it) I don't think I saw such a juicy looking woman on the screen, so perfect that even a homosexual like me was excited - and not just for aesthetic reasons (unless idiotic evangelicals really want to make their "convert -a-queer, they really need to raise their standards because no church mice need to pay here ...) Her breasts, the rest of her character, her adorable voice, the jolly way shakes when she walks around the room ... just to arrive In front of a man, breasts literally showed up as if in a wonderful confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all film history. No one has played against big women's stars more than he: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert and here Bardot, among many others. And he was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Caron, and had small parts in 'How to Steal a Million' with A. Hepburn, as well as being in Deneuve's movie 'The April Fools' (though not against her). All I can disagree with is the fact that even loud, unpleasant music over introductory credits is appropriate - I think Bardot is not meant to be gentle on top of everything else, and her vital volume (I don't mean her voice) She is part of her irresistible and one might even say exemplary magic. Vidal is pretty nice, though Brigitte's bond to the beginning "I don't know why I'm not even in love with you." '<br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardote! Really one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy of being with us when so many real personalities pass away so fast, in all their eccentric fame.
