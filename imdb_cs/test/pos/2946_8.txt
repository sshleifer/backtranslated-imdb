The fascinating piece of life of a documentary about her husband and marriage and their marriage was revealed by the eyes of her son. We all think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriage was full of fulfillment, love and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this may not be the case with their own families and their parents. This amazing little documentary is leaked through the camera lens and the emotional look at the son of the family who has just experienced the death of her mother. A documentary filmmaker has been filming his older family for many years, saying "offspring". Three months after his mother's death, his father remarried his longtime secretary. The suddenness of this event stuns the family and pushes the son to plunge into his mother and father's past lives. What she reveals is a fascinating insight into the lives of two rather ordinary people who love so much of their generation that they took time earlier because of bad reasons and found themselves in family life where they found out they had to "do". A wife who found herself bitterly lonely and unloved, and a husband who was buried in his work. She and the intellectual heart, he is a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasure in a quiet solitude of work. They are obviously bad, that's clear. But they did, huh? Well, that's part of the mystery, clearly showing affection for each other when not much love. You won't find any shocking information, except infidelity on both sides, which is in a good way what this jewel does. You really feel like it could be your parents if the circumstances were different and they really would be the lives of their parents.
