If you're a "child of the eighties" like me, you probably remember this Disney movie from 1981 - one of Disney's first PG-rated movies and Michael J. Fox's debut. I remember watching this movie again and again on HBO when I was in high school, and only recently did I find a very old copy because Disney stopped producing the movie a few years ago. Needless to say, it's a really funny movie to watch. Five college teams unravel the tracks in the Los Angeles evening race, trying to get to the finish first. Watch out for Paul Reubens's portrait. From raw music to the fat twin disco scene, it's a fun eighties movie you'll love.
