That's what James Cagney is about, wisecracks, cockiness, hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma. Although the story sounds serious, the movie is something, but. This happens in the style of a screwdriver-style comedy and works well with his "bickering" with fiancee Mae Clark and his reactions to the high stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What is above standard is dialogue and casting that supplies it. Dialogue is good, but it's nothing if the van is in place and can be reflected on the characters involved. All that well manages. <br /> <br /> Good fun and fun.
