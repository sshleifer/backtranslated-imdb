Dolemite is one of the best films representing a pimp as a hero who takes off a man, meanwhile covering all the best women the ghetto provides. Keep in mind that these women know karate, and they are fine foxy ladies. SPOILER - The last battle scene is crazy enough when Dolemite pulls out the heart of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated. In addition, there is a cast full of innovative brilliant characters such as Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee and more. Clothing is great and the sets are full of 70s. There are a few things in the production, such as a boom mikes randomly appearing, among other things, but it adds magic and laughs. <br /> <br /> I would recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie, and keeping the squares and men far apart.
