The "silver screen" is freshly polished with this beautiful film of aging happily and enjoying the life of the rainbow. There is a lot of silver hair on this silver screen, but its name is more than 85 years old with its energy, humor and longing for life. Extraordinaire entertainer story Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie and the nursing home residents, inspire us to "live every day as if it were your last" and bring glimpses of hope to the often feared golden years . . Great movie for young and old audience!
