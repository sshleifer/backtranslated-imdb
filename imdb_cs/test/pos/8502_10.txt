Don't forget the lover on the side !! It's 'hottie', Karen Parsons is excellent, she is beautiful, in acting and beauty and style. It's just his job! HO, here's a demonstration that typing in your intestines is imitating you and kicking you in your ass while doubles! When quoting Peter's wife (The Associate / writer / Producer), she said as they watched the "previews" of new "new" shows on the ABC network party when she looked at her husband after previewing "The Job." and he said, "This doesn't look like anything else on this network. You're in trouble." That means 'looks' very good! But it does not seem that a regular "shiny happy folk sitcom" or drama over the hair, which (ABC) regularly gives "Air", has been since the first episode was finished. I made sure he didn't miss this time next week, I was instantly addicted to "The Job" Shortening the joke and cynicism, outrageous situations and laughter that make this series a hit !! Then I felt anger and the feeling that I was letting the show go out of the air and wondering what the executive was doing, deciding to destroy the main comic stone of his network? I talked to other people some people know about it, some don't, but I know that stupid network didn't promote it hard enough, or I should say it visually, if it was, it should take at least 3- 5 seasons, maybe even six. I only believe that knowledge of network deficiencies and excessive logging into one "pattern" or another that missed th ship. There was so much room for expansion, barely started. The situations were funny and serious, fast, and sometimes slow, though it didn't keep up. A few years later I finally found a new DVD for $ 50.00. It would cost me $ 1,000.00 for me in my entertainment library. In amazement, I watched the third time I went through both periods on the DVD and the end of the episode "Betrayal", which came into a very serious dramatic segment that revealed the murder victim, was better than most of the Drama Unit and the "cop" victims in air! They entered the scenes as seriously as a heart attack and as believers did it as if they hadn't missed the rhythm. Just as it was to be serious, I am impressed by the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary share in screenplays and scenarios. In the next buzz of the "entertainment week" I learned that a beautiful wardrobe, silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish shoes ... were sold to a film made for cable "In the cut" "(2003) for just four hundred dollars, that's !!! ! I'm sick. Did you see what everyone wears for each show? A good coat could run so much. That was Denis Leary in some of his best. I recommend this great cop 'dramed' for East-coasters or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland joked with Leary in the episode "The Bathroom", repeating him from seeing him there. (****) Great intuitive, comic New York Leary / Tolan Cop Show.
