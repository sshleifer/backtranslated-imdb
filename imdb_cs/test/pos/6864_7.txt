Anatomy is an entertaining and engaging movie that lacks the feeling of discomfort that should be associated with the theme of movies. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical science is one that pushes the viewer towards discomfort, and the realism of the institutions ("Heidelberg") and the special effects make it not a very simple film. However, the characters, screenplay and shimmering of the film seem too familiar with the Scream films that repopulate this kind of genre. Sadly, even though this is one thing the viewer is supposed to take care of, he is presented with another film full of college students, that we don't really have a chance to take care of unsolved subplots and kill the stages that reappear. yourself from the memorial Drew Barrymore introductory scene in Scream a few years back. Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort scenario and direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme. While we are introduced to a fun movie with some reasonable performance, we have unfortunately left an old feeling: there is nothing wrong with this film, but nothing is exceptional. An entertaining movie and an interesting film a chance to see how foreign filmmakers were influenced by post-screaming horror culture. 6 out of 10
