Oz is a TV show that is intense non-stop adrenaline. It is a show that is not aimed at a large audience, but at a specific one because its topics are adult-oriented. This, of course, did not achieve mainstream success because it was an impossibility, but he had a lot of fame with his audience and many famous actors either guest played or became part of the show. Oz is a series of fictional stories based on jail located somewhere in New York State. There are many different ethnic groups that play a role on behalf of others. These groups are Muslims, Homeboys, Aryans, Bikers, Italians, Latin, Irish, Christians, Gays and more. Some have some form of affiliation with each other such as Bikers and Aryans while Aryans are the enemy of numerous groups such as Muslims and Homeboys. There is a policy in Oswald's punishment (his official title) that not many members of any ethnic group are allowed. It is the maximum prison for security and regular jail, where prisoners are sometimes sent to or from the program is called "general population" or "gen pop". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the major segments crossed between documentary and biographical. Hill is bound to use a wheelchair due to his unknown past. He is part of a "others" group that represents individuals who do not fit in other prison gangs. Of the many groups, the smaller ones are able to avoid the problems of most groups. times are bigger when they are busy in conflict. Few of the most remarkable characters are as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of his fellow Irish people and is always voluntarily involved in deadly activity for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is a watched Latino who is constantly struggling with his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is a Nigerian who was a former leader of the Homeboys gang. Hes also very physically very big and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful prisoners inside Oz. 4) Karim Said is a Muslim and black nationalist who is very defined in his opinions and wishes. He fights for the rights of his people at many levels through a show, from his own Muslim group, to the wider Black group, and even fights for all groups against unfair authority rules. His character seems to be in some ways identical to Malcom X, a well-known black rights champion who was also a Muslim. All in all, for his genre Oz is perhaps the biggest (a fictional prison show or an ethnic-based exhibition). relation ships). If it doesn't sound like your own serial type is probably not to be tested, but if it is, then it's definitely worth seeing. The biggest problem with the show is how addictive it is, some may feel bad looking at a lot of this kind of material. Researchers argue that it is harmful or not, but ultimately it's just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today. This means that he is an informer and indicator of the world rather than an aggressor.
