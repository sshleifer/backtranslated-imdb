Sure, when I saw this movie in HBO, I was a little unpredictable in following the plot, but I caught my attention when I saw Dustin Hoffman in it. I honestly am not fascinated by watching old movies, but it changes my mind in the long run. When I saw this movie that accompanied me, I learned again to look at my seat without noticing that my tears suddenly ran down my face, and then the heavy sigh in realizing what I was witnessing was released. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best films of the classic drama that I have long witnessed that even I can't imagine how it touched me. The story was very emotional but not so saturated. The characters were unrealistic for their roles; they have features that make viewers like any position in the film, such as Meryl Streep's role, a mother who honestly admits her mistakes in the past, but then believes she can face her emotional motives to get what she does they desire a just and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was too exceptional, I can't even understand how a guy could play really hard roles and suddenly jump into another role that is completely different, then she did it well. Even though I have seen movies many times when I was sitting on my back and sitting at my home scan, it is worthwhile to look at them and buy some time to see Kramer and Kramer, which will bring me another experience.
