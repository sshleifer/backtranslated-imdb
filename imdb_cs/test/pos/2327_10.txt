Scripting subtle comedy has been unmatched in recent years with no movie. The characters are interesting, though a bit predictable. The comic timing written in the script is more than enough to compensate for a well-worn submarine plot. When you are sure you know the end ... SURPRISE! I highly recommend it for all ages, although the younger lineup will probably not appreciate some of the finer links, they will certainly appreciate one gallery scene in particular! Great movie!
