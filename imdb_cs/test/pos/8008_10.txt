Of all Bat-movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and entertaining movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is much violent and darker, this is Batman that creator Bob Kane introduced himself many years ago. Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time it is against two deadly enemies, the penguin Danny Devit and Catwoman Catherine Michelle Pfeiffer. With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, film us on an adventure as Batman fights the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken resembles Max Shrek, a smart businessman who has his sleeve in his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components you have a movie that will throw you away. That's why you go to the movies. He's got everything. It's really a pity that Tim Burton was not instructed to continue. If so, I think permission will still be strong. Batman Returns is an amazing experience for fans who love movies.
