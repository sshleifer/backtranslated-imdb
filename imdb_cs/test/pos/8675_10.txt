Quite different, with a lot of underestimation and black comedy, that's a little to see, but those who will remember it. This film creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What is it about? I believe that alienation. Probably a spectator, but I found that this film is trying to say something about cold and emptiness behind design furniture and perfect facades. I don't know if I'm right. But this movie really got me. You see it. I really hope that the team behind this film will make more films and that they will continue to do so in their own, some special style. And I forgot: The Casting is great here, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g is perfect in the role of annoying man who doesn't understand where he is, what he does and why. Confirming that we do not understand the meaning of life (in the city) is what makes it uncomfortable. Everyone else is doing as they are told, pretending to be happy. This film is a good and humorous commentary on life in 2006.
