These three directors are in a good start. Three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of "rides" when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laughed at the veiled glances around the locker room in "Pool Days"; I smiled at the notion that fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand were considered homosexuals in "Dorothy's Friend" (ie, Browsing CD Music Shelves); and I crouched over "jock" in "Disco Years" whose sweet sex memory was now "smeared" by alcohol. It all looked so real. I look forward to further offers from this trio of directors.
