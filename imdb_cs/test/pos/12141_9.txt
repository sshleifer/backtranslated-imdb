Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that doesn't strive for style. That's why he has style. As the film is so underestimated and so factual, it becomes more and more involved. And since Abel Davos plays Lino Ventura, we have emotionally invested in this quiet, hard-core murderer who loves his wife and children, has a meeting with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night, that neither he nor we are expecting and who proves that He's just as willing to shoot a cop or traitor with as little emotion as blowing a little fluff. First we meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two little boys, one about 9 and one 4. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia," we said. "For years he has watched his sources diminish, though his anxiety has led him to move. When the Italian police closed every day, France was again his best bet. Davos was the best gangster in Paris to take care of his friends. That was a few years ago. The perpetrator who gives him the money to return to France is very bad. Now he's hiding with his two kids. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children have to get from Nice to Paris, but the police are hunting him and setting up roadblocks. Time has passed for Davos's two best friends, and they have moved on. They don't want to be at risk and for what? The duty can be careful. So they hired a young thief, Erica Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in the ambulance, then go to Paris with Davos's heavily bandaged and hidden children. We are on a path where Davos's possibilities are becoming more and more limited, where he must find ways to take care of his children, realizing that there are no more friendships where betrayal is likely, and where his only friend is probably. is Eric Stark. This rather cynical movie works so well because it does its job without arguing about it. There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no play with gangster code melodrama, so many French directors loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who once was someone who is now moving down and there is no one and who reacts with violence and resignation. Lino Ventura dominates the film, but chemistry becomes curious when paired with Jean-Paul Belmond. Ventura like Davos is grim and worried about his sons. His situation is humiliated. He is a hard man who sees that he will kill someone, if necessary, just as part of the business he is in. Belmondo as a young thief who is initially sent to become a driver who is unnecessary and who becomes a friend to whom he relies. keeps the film from being one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and looks younger. His unlikely star power as chief actor - broken nose, armpit jaw - shines directly on the screen. Erik makes a match for Ventura when they share the scene. And the Belmond scenes with Lilian (Sandra Milo), a young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate magic and good-natured sexual attraction. The end is a bittersweet destiny and no stylistic attitude in sight. We hear Davos says, "Abel's gone. Nothing left." It would be good to watch Classe tous Risques know what he meant. There are many fine French gangster movies. I would put this one right there with Touchez Pas and Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lina Ventura's best performances, watch the Shadow Army.
