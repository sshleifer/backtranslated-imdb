'It's not a movie' works because it's so true in what it's trying to say. If you ignore the plot dynamics and focus on the message, you'll see something in the main character, Michael. Whether it is a man or a woman, all of us are in a life where we want to look back and re-examine the situation or relationship. Did it really happen, as we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything else, he wants him to feel better as it turned out. But even so, he has a nice character because everyone is selfish in terms of relationships. We won't be different in them. As the movie ends, I'm not sure if Michael learned anything about himself or not. Our best relationship in relationship is his friend Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us that there are always two sides of each story. I found out that Michael is pompous, arrogant and simply plain. That's exactly why I liked him. It's a real character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then it's a movie for you. In the end, it's a movie for everyone.
