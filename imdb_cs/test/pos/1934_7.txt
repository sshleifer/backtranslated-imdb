One of DIRECTED's latest films by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents and Dance", plays in the sixth role of Barbara Stanwyck as a girl in the ballroom "Barbara". Stanwyck looks pretty "jane" in the matter, and opens up with the ballroom manager chewing it. Then comes the rich Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez), who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck together made three films together in the 1930s.) Then he meets Eddie, who is very different from the lively Carlton. The writer, Jo Swerling, worked on some biggies (His amazing life, Guys and Dolls and Gone with the Wind), so I was surprised that the characters and the script were so common. The story becomes more interesting about halfway, and is very similar to "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, also playing Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is much smarter, but also more tame, due to the on-weak code of Hays ...
