This is such a revered and studied film, a classic among many Hitchcock, but no need to look at it again. But do you think it can endure, even if a huge (and clever and amazing) trick isn't a surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. Beginning, a deeply beautiful and neat story about the whole story, its essence. Two taxis, two men showed up with their shoes, each of them going to the train, sitting opposite each other, and oops, mistake, a little twitch, and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. The tone is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and thrilling movies - merry and light. We know that we are entering the film, that it will not, so we are afraid. What actually goes wrong? <br /> <br /> A lot. In a true Hitchcock fashion, he is a purely innocent man (almost always human) who is facing injustice that is trapped by circumstances that threaten what is most valuable to him. Innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is playing with innocence that is believable - for example, his collegial courtesy in this first scene, for example, when he realizes that the other man is a little cuckoo is what you or I can do. A non-innocent man is a suicidal and incredibly intelligent spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, played with the sheer brilliance of Robert Walker. (This miracle performance is equivalent to the performance of another hackcock wack played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from one scene, on the train (and the train, really beautiful!), We have two wires and we have the mind. Blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot, from Patricia Highsmith's first novel, which also wrote books for Mr. Ripley's two films. And it doesn't hurt that Raymond Chandler himself wrote the script, who knows something about the economy and the smart dialogue. A crime. And of course there's more than just the first scene. What do you notice? Well, the skill of the senator's daughter (I thought she was amazing) is Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who is still with us (since 2009, also in psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark location for the key scene in the movie - tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the US Open site. The fantastic last full merry-go-round scene is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a slow and steady assembly that builds tension by making it unreal. Fear is fed up positively with the laughing children and the old man walking under him. And when it crashes in a crash - that's all that is back-processed, one of the director's more natural uses for not being interested in the realism of its back projections. Stunning Hollywood, without being stylized (as in some noir movies), is an object in itself. Look again at the first scene or at the filming (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is murder. This is a sophisticated design. When we're not completely surprised that it's Bruno in bed, it proves that the director has us on our fingers. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there any glitches? Who knows? It depends on what falsity you can accept (or accept) as a beautiful style. The scene where Bruno chills the old woman at the party is brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a car so trustworthy that she takes your breath away) and is marked by his gaze on the senator's daughter and is running into the deadly Trance of her glasses and her resemblance to his former victim. This is mid-20. centuries-old thought of psychology that penetrates many of Hitchcock's efforts. (End of Psycho, For Beginning.) The Wikipedia article on film intelligently emphasizes the consistent duplication of the film, from the main characters to the murder victim and senator's daughter. That sounds in a few ways - two men are watching him on the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on. There may be too much of it, but it gives us the aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Remember, there are two murders - it's a lack of a second murder, an inability to create a doubling in this case, causing Bruno to fall apart. Walker Actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized the year before the film was taken before he died of a drug reaction that calmed one of his explosions. Even though he has appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour. Farley Granger had a long career that never saw him break into the right star, even though his style may have a strange nervous sweetness that really works, especially at Night. And if you watch this for the first time or for the third time, look at the cool and cheerful scene of a tennis match where the crowd heads move in unison - except for Bruno. He looks out without moving his head on us. As the movie trailer says, after this movie, you won't talk to "strangers on the train."
