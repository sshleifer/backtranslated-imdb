James Aaron, a chubby actor living in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that aren't good for him. This is clearly stated, because Dick, a friendly store salesman, advises him to avoid poor food. Aaron, an actor working in Chicago is the second city, is a loving man who doesn't have much luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, the spunky, who encourages him to go out and have fun. James has another job in some sort of coarse "Candid Camera" where people are prepared for unusual situations such as mechanic surprise and narration that he is the father of a daughter he never knew. On the day he meets his friend Larry, he learns about casting a challenge to remake his favorite movie "Marty". Being a great man, he clearly identifies with the character in the film. In many ways, James's own life is in line with Paddy Chayefski's work in the picture. He wants to try the part because he knows he can do a part in the role. One day he meets Beth on a soda fountain. James likes a woman who one day invites him to shop with her for intimate clothes. She ends up with her sex, thinks they have a nice thing, but Beth has another surprise when she tells him why they went to bed because she never did with a fat man. After being disappointed, James encounters an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love for jazz. Finally, we watch James perform his long dream of playing in a theater production "Marty" in a nursing home. Jeff Garlin, who is a nice man, shows a talent for this type. comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in game styles, his takeover of James Aaron is right on money. As a director he did it before, even though it is an original concept he should watch. One of the benefits of the film is people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman gives the impression of marrying Beth. Bonnie Hunt underestimates his role as a school teacher for good results. Mina Kolb is considered her mother, a role she has played in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also on hand in a smaller role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr, Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast are valuable contributions. Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose efforts will be welcomed by his fans.
