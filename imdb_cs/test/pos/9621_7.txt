Martial arts movies were huge in parts of Asia in the 1960s, but with the growing popularity of Shaw Brothers' infamous films, America had to catch up. This film was the first to be introduced in America under the Warner Bros. label. and it actually started the madness that flooded the 1970s martial arts movies. Many of the movies to follow would pale in comparison but some were great and many like Enter Dragon (which came out shortly after this one) became huge accomplishments and made superstars out of these warriors. Fast forward almost 40 years later and this movie still holds. Most of the Shaw Brothers films are as good as they were at the time, and the truth was that there were no films in the genre to compete with those that The Shaw Bros competes during the day. <br /> <br /> I like to think that martial arts are like porn and no one watches porn for the storyline, just actions like the MA movies and most of them are just a few great fights with a little story, this is an exception . It doesn't have an amazing story, but there's one. <br /> <br /> The hero, Lo Lieh, excels among karate movie heroes. He never opens, and he never fights just because he can, is often perceived as a weak and less warrior than most, but when he has to fight, he's pretty damn good alive. I really loved this character. Many of the villains were unforgettable and the battle scenes were presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as a huge Mongolian, and it was in my best 5 as the greatest martial art of movie stars ever, it was also in the above Enter The Dragon. <br /> <br /> Production, as I said over and over again, is amazing, you can't beat Shaws, the direction was something that, unlike what I saw in the 1970s, the use of color was well placed and This movie became independent and resurrected over others. When the light turns on the hands of Chi Hao, how does the Iron Fist, its pure beauty. The music was also excellent. Martial arts movies were to Asia what westerns were to Italy, two separate forms of art with so much in common. The countries that had these films had all the genres, but Japanese films were what the waves created there, because Western spaghetti was in Italy. With their many differences the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in movies like 5 Fingers Of Death, the fighting was easily comparable to Sergio Leoni's cowboy position, and the music tied the genres so well. The music lent here a little from Ironside, but it was still very original. Many movies were inspired by this and when I watched, I see everything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport. The most visible film that was influenced was Kill Bill, who is the greatest of all time for me. Many of the Quentin sets are complete replicas of those you see here, and used the music from that movie, even though the music he used was music borrowed from Ironside. And the battle scene at the end of Kill Bill vol.1 with Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate compared to fighting with Chi Hao and the Japanese thief at the end of the film. I've seen many martial arts movies, a couple of pairs better, but it's MUST-SEE for fans of the genre. You can't go down here. The film starts slowly but 15-20 minutes into it and rises and does not slow down.
