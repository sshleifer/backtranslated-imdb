I rented this movie as a Rupert Grint fan a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with lots of great actors. It was fun and it turned out that Rupert Grint could play more than his most famous character, Ron Weasley. His subtle depiction of Ben and the great acting performance of each of them make this movie very likable. Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and happens, I think you could call an "assistant" on Evie, a retired actress. At first it's just a way to make some money. But after a while Evie seems to be developing a friendship. Evie helps Ben get a little out of his shell and gets to him to have fun and be happy with him, and they both seem to need it. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is really fun with some very cute and moments. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
