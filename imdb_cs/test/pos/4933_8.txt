How I spend my holiday concludes a TV series that aired from 1990 to 1992. I have always enjoyed the series for what it is. I've never compared a series with the Looney Tunes of old times. The video release was divided into four or five episodes (I can't remember how I write it) for television and is part of a series episode list. What is good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a significant role in the story. We see what they do during the summer holidays in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents in Safari, Plucky and Hampton across the country with her parents Hampton, Fifi is in some beach, etc. The peak is very good and at the end all Tiny Toon characters put up for the start of the new year in "Looniversity", virtually ending a good run of this TV show.
