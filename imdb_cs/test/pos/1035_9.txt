I watched this mini in the early 1980s. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. In fact, when law and order began, I was disappointed in it because it was not such a powerful role. Unfortunately, good roles do not pay bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and check it out. It's both factual and fun. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And he saw this man become an unlikely hero who had never been rewarded for his insight. If you have a chance, be sure to check out this movie and see what kind of performance Mr Waterston can actually provide to the audience. Enjoy movies!
