Every once in a while you come across a film that exceeds your wildest expectations. Due to the IMDb rating of 4.0 I didn't expect much with Brother Satan. I was hoping that at a minimum, it could be fun, like Rainy Rain or any of the other 70s, like thematic Satanic horror movies. I couldn't be more bad. Instead, I was an ambitious and intelligent movie with a cast that I really enjoyed. Speaking in a broad sense to avoid anything, the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward narrative so prominent in the early 1970s. The Satanic Brotherhood will not overcome your head with conspiracy points and explanations. The hour is left to the viewer to fill the gaps. As a viewer, you know that something is wrong, but you're not sure what it is for the longest. Unknown helps to make a more terrifying atmosphere than most similar films. The end is effective with its surrealistic image. I sat in awe when the final credit began to roll. Those who want a big slam-bang finale will be disappointed with the simplicity of the end. A smaller film would try to pull out all the stops and most likely failed miserably. There are times when it is easy to forget about director Bernard McEveety, who primarily worked on television before Satan's brotherhood. There are several scenes that are so well-set, lit and shot that even the most successful directors can learn something or two. For example, over the years I have seen enough movies to realize that directors sometimes have difficulty in taking pictures of widescreen images indoors. Not here. The scene where men discuss their sheriff's office plan is amazing. Do we see all five men at once? everyone does their own thing like in real life. In a smaller movie, we could see all the men at once, but everyone would be still and wait quietly for their dialogue to come. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and it's so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of the Satanic Brotherhood. Finally, I mentioned acting in my opening, so without going into a long talk, I'll just say that the Satan Brotherhood contains Strother Martin and LQ Jones. Any movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.
