Players: DR is not a fantastic movie, it's amateur video. Terrible magic effect, really fake fireball, awfully divided dungeon, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, bathrobe, plate ..... ok ... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expectations to the visual, then get 105 minutes of fun. I'm from Hong Kong and it's really hard to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I'm always glad to be one of the characters in the D&D world. Player Tracking: DR just shows me what it would be like to be a player. You see rules, dice, game sets, etc. Etc.; You hear terms like "fighter", "guide", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> What makes me an RPG is that it is letting you do something you want, not bound by a software RPG. Players: DR provide the same element, you wont know what happens next and it's probably just you laughing dead. The film goes into the real life of players and into the world of D&D. You will hear a player throwing dice when a character is playing in the game, giving you the feeling that you are actually in the game. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything, but simply, players: DR needs to watch a movie for RPG lovers. For people who never play an RPG game, I'm sure you're still enjoying it.
