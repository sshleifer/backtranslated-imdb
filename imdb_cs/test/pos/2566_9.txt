then you will be a great fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mix of music, soul and drama. I admit, I was a little cautious when I saw this movie, I just saw the thumbnail of a white girl strapped to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and enjoyed Hustle & Flow so I thought I'd give him chance. I'm very glad I did it. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomian southern girl trapped by a 60-year-old black man. The story had a heart, and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except for the new spin and used the Blues. His music scenes are still at the top of the charts in terms of performance scenes. It also has very interesting flashback scenes and only gives you an overall crazy feeling during some more controversial scenes. There is no doubt that if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie and if you are blues fans you should definitely go see it. I give him 9 out of 10, a very interesting movie, and it is extremely under rated. shame. Go out and rent this movie.
