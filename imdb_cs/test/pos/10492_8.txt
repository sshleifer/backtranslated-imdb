Of the 600 or more spaghetti westerns it must have been somewhere in the top twenty. I can't believe this rating has not received any ratings! Gemma is excellent. Van Johnson is good too, although his dubbed voice is a bit off the killer, but that is the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photos and some great staged events. All supporting characters play well. The severity of a racist lane in the villains is even tough, even today's standards, which in some of the situations that take place create the emotional depth of the Gemmas character. Absolutely FANTASTIC score by Luis Bacalov. Check it out in a beautiful widescreen DVD from Japan. Must have spaghetti.
