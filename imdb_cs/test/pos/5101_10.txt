I wish I was first shown in a movie theater when it was first released, as some commentators were. It's really a treasure. To be fair, I haven't seen any other version Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and I don't want to. For me, this is the perfect version. I first saw it in front of the TCM and I never forgot it. I was delighted to have watched it with my girlfriend yesterday, though I had it before. There were parts of the movie in which we were both tears-eyed, this is a really moving movie. And shouldn't it be what movies are all about? The music is beautiful, the movie was shot beautifully. Activity is top. The story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
