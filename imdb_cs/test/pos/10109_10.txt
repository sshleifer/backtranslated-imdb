Beauty. Terror. Poetry. Horror. Innocence. Fault. Maybe it's just about everything I should write in this commentary for TALET TWO SISTERS. It's best to watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I didn't even know one thing about the history of both girls when I went to this movie. I just looked at a nice cover-art, didn't read the synopsis on the back and jumped into the DVD player. All I knew was that he won several awards at festivals around the world and that it was highly recommended. DVD-cover reads "The most scary movie from RING, GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the scary part might be right, you can forget the rest, because the only thing TALET TWO SISTERS have to do with these movies is ... a ghostly revelation with long black hair. It is even a little unfair to compare it with the famous Japanese films because this Korean film has much more to offer and is actually a little more complex and intelligent than the others. This movie is just a little masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The film itself caught me off guard at least twice with clever surprise-twists. And just when you think you have come to a conclusion (whether you have it or not, it's irrelevant at the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie is a little longer. Cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camera is excellent, the director sometimes chooses impressive, if not innovative, angles. Some shots are pure poetry (eg Top-shot with two sisters by the lake). Everything looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the intrigues surrounding them are intense. The story itself starts a little slower, but there's a lot of different tones and emotions to make it interesting. Even one scene (when the girls took off to the lake) suddenly remembered how Peter Jackson looked. But when the horror begins, it's pretty effective. There are also several successful surprises-scares in him. Damn, I jumped right out of the sofa. The music score is great and I couldn't help but when it wasn't to be scary, I noticed it had some Italian feel. A little special for Korean film. But still, great score. So much attention went to every detail of this movie, including perfectly balanced surround sound. Also, I think A TALE TWIST SISTERS is just a horror movie that doesn't give him enough credit. It is rather a mysterious horror drama that works on both psychological and supernatural levels. No matter how you look at it, it's an Asian horror movie that ranks among the best. It doesn't have to be cruel, but sometimes it's scary and the subject is pretty disturbed. So if you haven't seen it before, then find a copy, pop into the DVD player, go with the stream and make sure you pay full attention to this movie for 110 minutes. <br /> <br I hope I did a good job of praising it without spoiling anything.
