Well I have to say that I had the opportunity to see this show here in Philadelphia, PA sometime in June 06. And I really loved it.my all time favorite Madonna look was 1990 Blond Ambition tour era.this it is "MADONNA" I know that She is Mother 3, has to change some things to suit motherhood. And I totally agree. This is a classic Madonna concert. I wish to "live it to say" wasn't edited. on 911, we can see a woman on the cross ... however I look forward to the release of this DVD tour and hope this whole show is untidy and with lots of bonus footage.she is the artist all the time. top and go strong.long live MADONNA!
