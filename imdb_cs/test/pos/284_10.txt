With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses it was, in my opinion, David Jason's best series. <br /> <br /> Right after your TV debut on "Don't Edit Your Set!" These 13 episodes revealed the mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days. By comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours, and the horrible "Lucky Man" series didn't come close. I believe Jason forbade repeating the show because it showed him the purest. Shame on him. The new generation deserves it. The series actually fell into ratings, but this is most likely because it was shown against 'The Brothers', which aired on the BBC at the same time as the VCR were commonplace. BTW, I just noticed that his long-suffering assistant, Spencer, played Mark Eden; Alan Bradley of Coronation Street. I'm amazed he didn't try to murder Edgar Briggs !!!!
