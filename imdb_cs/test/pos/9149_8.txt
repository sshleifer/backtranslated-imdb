This film is a good start for beginners who have never seen 'Silent Film' and for those who believe that quality Cinema has begun with generation efforts. They do bearish service for themselves by not expanding their horizons. 'Silent Film' is an art form of acting in pantomime that is different from sound film and stage, it can stand on its own merits. ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictional history of the relationship of the French poet Francois Villon and King Louis XI. Through the "Villons" incitement of "King Louis" he defeats his nemesis "Duke of Burgand" minimizes the Feudal system and takes the king as head of state and the origins of modern France. The cast is exceptional by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who remember him only for the dilapidated actor "Larry Renault" in the Eve Party (1933) or in the Ham in the Unseen Wives (1940), it will be a revelation. Fit, cut with a 'big profile' still in evidence that commands on the screen. Co-Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his 'dead spider' interpretation of 'Louis XI'. It is a duel of actors, each of whom does not give a second thumb. On the trivia note is the character actor and dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his latest, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other actors who would continue to sound that is easy to pick up. <br /> <br /> United Artists spared no cost in this beautiful production supervised by WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props, and sets are well done and not exaggerated as in DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS. Here is the touch of reality. The copy on the DVD we watched from 'Delta Entertainment' came from a good master. Although not 'restored' by his musical soundtrack was clear and the press only suffered from harassment of black-spots (dirt) and drop-outs. The only major damage at the end of the last reel of water. 'Kino' also has an edition that can be of better quality because it makes significant replacements on its prints. Best check with them. In our opinion it is "must have", especially if you have no "silent" in your collection. This is a good place to start.
