Probably because it's Columbia's first film in color, colors look different in indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very enjoyable. Randolph Scott is a sheriff, a good guy, but the real movie star is a very young Glenn Ford who is an outlaw who wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is a woman who begins to fall on Ford and Claire Trevor is a countess who runs the salon. There is a funny character called Nitro who doesn't think twice before it blows. Especially I enjoyed two moments of the movie, one when there is a huge horse, and you see thousands of horses, at that time there was no computer to help, so I suppose they had to have all those horses, no easy task. Another moment is the last shootout, technically very good. There is also quite fistfight. When we see this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes, you make it a sad conclusion: they won't do it anymore. Could they, if they wanted to? I have doubts.
