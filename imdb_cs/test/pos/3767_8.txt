Who are the people who play in this matter? I've never heard of them! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've come across. She should win Putz Puller's prize for parody. The absurd begins with Dr. Jeykl snorted his powder and turned to sex fiend.He is being watched by a libido driven sister soon in the movie in one of the most fun movie scenes. Pay attention to the hospital system in the background; rather as a MASH system. The last scene with Hyde accepting the prize has been laughing for years. Oh ... and "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who became Elvira, Lady of Darkness. <br /> <br /> If you liked the classic Mel Brooks movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I think you like it. Damn you can't get her a DVD anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now available on DVD !!!!! Good thing, DVD is not worn out !!!!!
