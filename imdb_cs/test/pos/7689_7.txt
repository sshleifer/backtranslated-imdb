I recently had the honor of seeing the last 35mm, Technicolor, stereo print, and found it more vibrant and palpable than he remembered. Also closer to the original material - in essence, all screenwriter N. Richard Nash did, was clipping, changing much recitative to spoken dialogue, and inserting a transitional scene or two (including very entertaining for Pearl Bailey). Oliver Smith's production design is stagnant in the adaptation regime of "Li'l Abner" - "Guys and Dolls" but works well for folklore, unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to the extent that it invokes the wince. Furthermore, for the film of his time, it is quite honest - adultery, violent behavior, drug use and self-destructive habits of Catfish Row residents are not at all minimized in narration. However, there are debits starting with all these changes from the stage text. Losing so many compromises of Gershwin's brilliance - no wonder her family doesn't like it. Reorchestration, particularly by Sammy Davis Jr., is alarmingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; you didn't have to worry so much about it. And when Poitier and Dandridge act well, and their singing doubles sing well, there is a huge gap between singing characters and talking voices - you are always aware of sophistication. What really counts here is music, one of the biggest theater scenes, anywhere. Despite all the jerks, he will survive and you will have to be made of stone to keep himself from moving. If the treatment is not entirely in line with the hobby of the estate (and it should not be), there is no reason why it should not spend some money to restore this ambitious shoot of Gershwin's masterpiece and the new generations become more aware of his genius.
