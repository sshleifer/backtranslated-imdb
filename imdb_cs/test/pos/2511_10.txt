I normally don't like romantic movies, but I love this movie. The story is really moving and the end is very suitable. I feel that I really cared about many characters in this movie. I feel I feel their feelings. While most romantic movies always make me feel separate and bored, this totally entangles me, starting with the Capshaw scene that runs along the beach with Scott until the end of the scene. I want to rate this movie 11 out of 10 because I want to give one more point for the end. The actor's part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to show her talent. Although Scott in the Dead Man on Campus impressed me, this film completely changes my view of him. She is so irresistibly charming. Geraldine McEwan is as amazing as ever. This film may not be as good, complex, deep or believable as other films that deal with the same kind of relationship, such as "L". ecole de la chair "or" Post coitum, animal triste ", but" The Love Letter "can still be proud of itself because it casts a rare different light on this kind of relationship. And this difference makes this film extremely enjoyable. Being ambitious and relying on the great magic of small stars, Dreamworks, this time you really make my dream real.
