Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the best director shorts. Although the circus may arouse ugly memories of McKimson's terrible "Big Top Bunny", "Acrobatty Bunny" is not nearly as boring as the travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a wild lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the start, not to mention an extremely attractive look. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a clogged elevator out of his hole to rise right into the lion's jaws. In a brilliant Disney parody, he shouts "Pinocchio" down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some professionally choreographed antics in and around the Lion Cage to begin with, followed by a cheerfully grotesque and tantalizing rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which, as a child, I have published regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence that gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of a circus as an environment for cartoons and you'll find that it usually does for a dull and predictable set of gags, but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks out of form and results in an exciting funny short that stands amongst McKimson's best.
