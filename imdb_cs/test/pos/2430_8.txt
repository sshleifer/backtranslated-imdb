There is no doubt that the real Anna Anderson was not Princess Anastasia. Except for very significant differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are noticeably larger, lips are stronger, nose is bigger and appeared at the endâ€¦ etc.) Anderson is not able to speak Russian, it was a ridiculous story ...... I don't like Anna Anderson and her companions. Not a lot of cheaters have the courage and perseverance to deceive for more than 60 years with such a steadfastly unsustainable scheme. Yet I am somewhat likeable to Anna Anderson. Life had to be difficult for a young Polish peasant in those days. And impersonating another woman in over 60 years is a difficult task for everyone. She had to hold her fleshy lips all the time to imitate Anastasia's thin lips, and at times she had to bother to believe that all her chaotic memories were just the result of a mental problem. Anna Anderson was a wonderful woman on the wrong track. If she gave her a good-looking appearance, she learned elegance, perseverance, acting skills for proper use, she could make a first-class actress. On the note side: Some of the main characters in this double-bar seem to be loosely based on real numbers. Prince Erich could be a mixture of Gleb Botkin (believed by many possible brains behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg and several other characters. It seems that Darya Romanoff is based on the magnificent Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike real companions, Prince Erich was helpless in this show and supported Anna out of love for the sincere faith that touched her. Overall, it's a great show. Slightly distorted but still true to reality. The power of acting by Amy Irving is that she has successfully represented Anderson's self-assurance, the mix of herself and herself is interesting. Like Princess Xenia about Anderson, she said, "She was alone in all circumstances and never gave the slightest impression that it was a role." Highly recommended.
