What a great cast for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many smart lines - I was laughing a few times after being delivered. I found Manna from Heaven to have some surprising moments, and when there were things I thought would happen, the way they met was something other than predictable. This movie is about hope and error correction. I left the theatrical feeling inspired to do the right thing. Five sisters.
