The merchant of Venice, William Shakespeare, is about the Jewish lover and his bond to gain the wealth of meat from the wealthy businessman Antonio, who is in debt. Jewish moneylender, of course, is Shylock and he is given such soaring performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding actors like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes, and Lynne Collins disappear into the background. The film takes place in the 16th century in Venice and director Michael Radford relies on the environment, mood and realism to tell his story, rejecting rich period costumes or a modern rock music environment to reach a wider audience. Radford divides the three-hour duration into a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening narrative, he tells us how Jews came to England, were exposed to increasing persecution, and were eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, could make profits only by lending money at interest, and were forced to live in the Venetian "ghetto", the ancestor of the darker events to come. In the film, businessman Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits on Shylock in public, yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested a lover of Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to a duly trial of Portia (Lynne Collins) \ t heiress. Although Shylock was offended by Antonio, he agrees to borrow money without interest for three months on the condition that bond forfeiture grants him the right exactly a pound of meat from the heart of Antonio. The game is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's works, there are also touches of a broad comedy. Here comedy includes three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, friend of Bassanio, and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, daughter of Shylock. Portia offered herself a person who can choose the right treasure from one of the three boxes of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the golden, the prince of Aragon from silver, and both are disappointed. But Bassanio loves her and opens a lead coffin to find a portrait inside. Radford's adaptation expresses a remarkable sense of time and place. Portia Residence in Belmont proposes one of those wonderful summer homes with intact gardens and art treasures that hang in every room and contrast well with the eccentric view of Shylock with its dense streets. When it is clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice and leaves Portia. When it comes, the loan is in default and Shylock demands his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, based on Portia's wealth, offers multiple increases in installments, Shylock intends to avenge not only for the loss of money, but also for the life of an outsider. The Duke, sitting in judgment, will not intervene when Portia enters the mask as an attorney to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights when all parties come to court to reach a final decision. The merchant from Venice is not just about unpaid debt, but also about alienating Jews from their Christians and their desire for belonging. This was one of Shakespeare's most controversial games, and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic game or simply a game of anti-Semitism that reflects the prevailing view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a cartoon, he is an ambiguous figure, and there are many indications that Shakespeare perceives his mistakes as human failure, not Jewish. The Duke acknowledges that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate Torah language. In a monologue, "I am a Jew. Is it not the eyes of the Jews?" If you shock us, we must not laugh, if you poison us, we will not die, and if we are wrong, will we avenge ourselves? â€œShylock shows universal humanity, expressing equality for all men. Although we are horrified by the sentence he wants to do, we feel his pain over the years. Pacin's performance brings a new character to the text, and his often extraordinary personality is replaced by a more subtle, more captivating performance that brings his understanding to the matter. During an interview in Toronto at the International Film Festival last September, Radford said about Pacina. "When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great machine. It's a bit like driving a strong car. You have to dare to do it." He dared and we are all recipients.
