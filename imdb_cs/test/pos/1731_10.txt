Doctor Who's amazing. It's all a "cup of tea". It must be. Boys will love monsters and action and adventure and girls will love the emotions and feelings that go by. Billie Piper was as special as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. David Tennant is also funny and funny and so fun to watch. stuck on a parallel universe with his on-off friend Mickey and her mother and father (died when Rose was a child, but this Pete Tyler is from a parallel universe). It will be very special when Martha becomes a new companion because I only saw it with Rose (except Runaway Bride with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema should be good !!! But no one can beat Rose !!!
