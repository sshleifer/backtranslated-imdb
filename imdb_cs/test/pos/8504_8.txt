Famous French detective Henri Cassin with his first vacation in 11 years in St. Margot meets Nanette, the daughter of the recreation site owners. Despite Nanette's pledge to baby pet Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite Father Nanette's objection to Henri's age. On the day of their wedding, Leon returns and Nanette runs after him. Nothing can be heard of the two until they are both dead, and Henri swears he will not rest until he finds the killer. The only trace Henri has to work with is the trace found by Leon, but also receives written warnings that others will soon die. Soon Nanette's mother is found dead and Henri has no idea of ​​the killer's identity. He thought that the failure to return to Paris would then (and fears) be the only one person, even though none of his colleagues could believe his explanation. From an ordinary murder mystery that doesn't actually control a formula in another genre from Columbia or other B studies. This will certainly be due to director Lewis, who, despite the film's setting, manages to turn it into a slick film, which is also supported by a good camera and lighting. In a very good performance, Geray probably turns his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry his performance. Rating, 8.
