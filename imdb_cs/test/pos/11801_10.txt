Let me start by saying that I was very surprised at the production value of this film. I managed to catch an earlier performance and I must say that this is the best (if not only) Christian film that will hit the theaters of The Passion. Don't be discouraged from evaluating PG-13, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are solved in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is certainly a film that a group of young young youth could see without the upsurge (most) of the parents and the news is amazing. Best of all, it's not a movie for Christians, it's a family movie without Syrian 7. Heaven. Laughter is there and everybody laughs at the theater several times, humor bits were natural and didn't seem to be written or forced, and that made it good for stimulation in such a serious movie. Adolescents and young adults, religious and others, will be able to identify with many, if not all, characters in the film, and I was surprised to see how these questions deal with this type of film. The storyline is by no means predictable, and at the end hits closer to home than many admit. Fortunately, Christians do not show themselves, because all the powerful know that it is all the word "Word", but instead people simply try to understand life. People make mistakes and no one is perfect, even in this movie ... not for a long shot. Acting is upstairs, writing on the spot, and you're not hit over the head with all the preaching Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that you and your teen thinks, talks to and possibly question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family movie in January, check out your local movie footage and learn about yourself. And I'm a 25-year-old man who wanted to see a free movie.
