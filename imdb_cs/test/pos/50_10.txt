Fantastically written, acted and produced! Beloved ones who see this vibrant, talented cast - each one of them - give so much performance. This film thoroughly warmed the frogs of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for Black History. Full of accurate depictions of recent history and very real characters that have magnified incredible pain - with dignity and faith in a better future. It is so easy to understand how these diverse adults have all influenced this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would ultimately engulf his adulthood talent. Next time you will be in the company of a listening and observing child, remember; show or he can be a writer-in-the-making!
