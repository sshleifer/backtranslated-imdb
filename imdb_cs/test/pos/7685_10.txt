I was in my 20s, I just graduated from college when this movie appeared. Seeing it was a major impact, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its many awards), but also because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Since then, social progress is almost impossible to understand that my college started to accept (carefully thought out) black students in 1953. The mainstream, extravaganza with almost exclusively black cast, was a significant novelty in 1959. The film was featured in a luxury roadshow presentation in only the best theaters, complemented by a souvenir program that details the rich care that was made with lighting and color, multi-track stereo sound, and so on. Almost every black entertainer we had white people had knowledge of the film was in the movie. Gershwin's music, the brilliantly executed and utter universality of humanity, moved tremendously. Recently, I was able to get a faded copy of a two-hour film cut and repeated views confirmed my opinion. Time has done what seemed to be, the flooded sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame, but the music quality has not diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their imagination. What a crime that young artists today are unable to see these artists on top of their careers!
