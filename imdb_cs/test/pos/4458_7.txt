If you like who-dun-its, you will like this movie, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci did. It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disrupt anyone. Many would be offended by local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She joked, but she was naked and jumped to the chance to jump into the bones. He also tries to seduce a local priest. Young boys appear missing and there are some interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you? Jump on the first guy, it's too early, and he's too obvious. Anyone who is familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the murderer who died at the end of a violent death. What crazy thoughts he had.
