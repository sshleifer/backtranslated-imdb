'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five boys who misfits (most notably Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, and Kieth Coogan) trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government imprisoned the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr plays a school director, a stubborn guy who tries to instill a sense of discipline with his students. <br /> <br /> 'Toy Soldiers' is a fun and pretty cool event, and definitely a better hostage movie - a school crisis. I think most appeals come from a teenage cast, but also that the terrorists don't look like totally useless, while in some movies they never seem to be a pretty intimidating group they should. He is trapped inside a boarding school and threatens to be killed if the army or police intervenes, which is a very challenging task for these groups of men who are planning to save the school. They're actually pretty smart, too. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it was a pretty good movie. It keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or something like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underrated action film.
