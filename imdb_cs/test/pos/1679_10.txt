Rififi deserves much mention of the famous heist scene, and the scene deserves all the credit. It's a masterpiece of tension, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not just one scene - every scene in the film is just as masterfully composed and as a whole the film is not only taught with tension, conspiracy and character, but also with an admirably narrated moral story. film noire for years to come. Cinematic and technically, the heist sequence can be the most impressive scene in the movie, but for me it's the last scene that has the greatest power - the hallucinogenic substances Tony le St√©phanois to redeem.
