This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The famous Technicolor shows off the beauty of Rita Hayworth and beautiful hair. She should make more films in color, but then Columbia was hardly in a position to shoot money for a Technicolor theater performance. Rita is a WOW like Rusty Parker - in some she is more than just Gene. lightest numbers ever. She also looked beautiful at the turn of the century dress, so she got a chance to play her own grandmother. The movie opens with "The Show Must Go On" - It Looks Like To Me - But Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not overwhelmed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to be better and is going to audition for the Golden Wedding Envelope Vanity competition. Rusty will also be auditioned. In a very funny scene, Maurine just auditioned and seen Rusty giving her some tips to impress the judges !!! "Don't be shy and stupid - shake and spark". Rusty does so with gusto !!! They decide for Maurin and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - reminds him of someone in his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still a nightmare over Rusty's audition. "Whose Complain" features Genius (Phil Silvers) and dancers dressed as working girls - (Rusty is a taxi driver). John remembers long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) saw her singing "Sure Thing" for the first time. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local guest. They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make the Way for Tomorrow". "Give Me a Test" is a lively song and dance number featuring Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile, Rusty was chosen by Cover Girl and Danny McGuires' is the place to be seen. Lee Bowman appears to be Danny's romantic rival and puts things to the point. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring man ever to be boring, so Danny never has to worry. Rusty (nicknamed Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and dances beautifully for Danny and Rusty. The cloaks that Rita wears are amazing. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling have suggested them. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but she's afraid of losing it. Gene Kelly is also fantastic at the "Alter Ego" number where she dances with herself. "Poor John" is another look back at the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relationships - Hayworth looks beautiful in amazingly curious clothes. Check out Al Norman in both "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was a stunning eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "Jazz King" and "Paramount on Parade". He was easily visible. "Cover Girl" is just amazing. Rita was so talented - beautiful and great dancer. After American magazines appeared in the beautiful show models, Rusty bursts into beautiful gold dresses dancing down the ramp to the very catchy song "Cover Girl". Gosh I LOVE this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
