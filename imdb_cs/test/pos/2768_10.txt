This film is very good and the whole family would enjoy it. When Susie Q is on her big night on the ball, she dies in a fatal car accident on her way to the ball of children who are drunk and tall. Susie sells the house and the family moves to the house she loves. As a boy who now lives in the house, he sees Susie and is the only one who can. Two teams along with their little little sister and try to save Susie's parents from the fool. good. But no one seems to have it on DVD or VH's and it no longer appears on TV.
