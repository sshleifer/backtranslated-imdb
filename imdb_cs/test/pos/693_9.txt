Any movie about World War II that was made during World War II by a British manufacturing company, in my opinion, has no other peer in any way. So many things that are close and dear to my heart are in U Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a student of all aspects of World War II, and especially naval combat, I prefer displaying dives and actions in the north. And especially those that include the German side of things. For those not familiar with the target priorities, attacking an enemy warship is the biggest event a submarine can encounter, and such a rare opportunity would surprisingly evolve like what we see here. Stimulation is deliberate and typical of works that emanate from Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios throughout the day: frankly, I prefer his quieter, more cerebral approach to his humanity and realism, which is much better than any over-produced Hollywood. the film could ever. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's 49. Parallel thanks to my powerfully convincing Eric Portman. John Mills earns a second title and a lower font in titles, so this is clearly meant as Mr. Portman's movie, but the cast is lit. As for the sequence of titles, am I the only one who is absolutely enchanted by the beautiful pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl by Gainsborough Production?
