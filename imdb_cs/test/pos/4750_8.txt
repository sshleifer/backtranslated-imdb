This film is a classic seventies that unfortunately overlooked for some reason. This is essentially the French connection meets Bullit. Roy Scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives, known as "Seven Ups" <br /> <br /> One of their men is discovered during a secret op and is killed. Scheider and his team have to find their killers. They engage in battle with the crowd. The highlight of the film must be a chase for a car, which of course is included in cash for the success of Bullit. However, this car chase out the Bullitt due to its length, speed and sheer excitement. It is a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and efficiently. Don't miss this little gem!
