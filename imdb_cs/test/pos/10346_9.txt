A moving film about a talented woman who fights with society and love that structurally underestimates her. The problems are discreetly solved and timeless because many of the depicted difficulties between a man and a woman still exist in Dutch society today. This film is a tribute to all modern women without living on feminism. Not only is the story well said, acting and scenery are also great.
