My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 young children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or vulgarity. No special dollar effects have been added so viewers can try to misrepresent the badly written story. Simple little family fun movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we just heard some of the songs ... Mostly during the closing credits ... I'd like to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same instructions as above. With all the movies out there that you don't want your kids to watch, this Hillman fella has no risk assessment. We love his movies.
