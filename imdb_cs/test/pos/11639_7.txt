Although it may not be his saddest movie, MIGHTY LIKE and MOOSE stand as one of Charley Chase's most contented comedies, twenty minutes of smart gags, pretty choreographic physical comedies and fun pieces (of course, using the title card). ) all based on a miserable and wildly unlikely assumption. Upstairs we said that it was a "story of a home-made woman - a woman with a face who would stop the clock - and her husband with a face that would start him again." S Soon we will meet Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has huge nose. However, there is no point in discussing credibility when our conspirator depends on such an apparently incredible series of intertwined matches: ie First, Charley will have his overbite fixed on the day his wife had her nose settled, secondly that each of the spouses kept their respective cosmetic operations secret from each other, and thirdly, when they publicly hit each other, Charley and Vivien wouldn't know each other. Sounds a bit like a stretch, doesn't it? Multiple sections are rather similar. Obviously, we are here in the world of farce, and we just have to turn around with stupid twists, so if you can relax and forget the credibility, you can enjoy this brief moment. MY POSSIBLE LOCATION MOOSE will be on a leisurely start as various story complications emerge, but things are gathered as soon as Charley and Vivien "met" and made the date they attended the party together at Charley's dentist's house . Each of them rushes home excitedly, enters independently and initially does not realize the mutual presence. (Mr and Mrs Moose seem quite wealthy, by the way, because they live in a luxury-hotel residence.) A beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of Buster Keaton's NAVIGATOR, in which the husband and wife are gossiping. house without encountering face to face. And as soon as he arrives at the party, the comedy really gets into high gear because Charley is forced to dance with Gale Henry's gawky wallflower. Henry, the predictable player in his own right, who has played in many 1914 short comedies, is cheerful as a dance partner who brings her great strength but little mercy. There is also an elegant film touch in this sequence when the camera moves down to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner, yet we are able to track exactly what is going on between the principles by watching their feet. Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien, the party they visit attacks and the complications are multiplied when they escape from the police and return home. When Charley realizes that his newly pretended wife has tried to get off with another man, he decided for each lesson. . . and of course he forgets that he was trying to do the same. The last few minutes of this movie offers some of Chase's most entertaining physical comedies, which have a good wound look. POTENTIALLY, MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow and is surely one of the most entertaining comedies produced by a prolific, unfortunately underrated Charley Chase.
