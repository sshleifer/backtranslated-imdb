I love almost everything that late Al Adamson has directed in his long and colorful career, but "Sister Sherri's Obsession" stands above his head and shoulders over the fun, yet it's definitely Z-schlockfests like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and "Dracula Vs" Frankenstein ". This movie is actually scary! I say when you look at "Sister Sherri", do you jump out of your seat? No, of course not. But the pastoral elements of "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" are one of those pretty, scary little horrors common to the 1970s. You can't put your finger on what's so scary about it, but the movie drips with the atmosphere. (And what's the end! Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it, and it doesn't matter whether "Sister Sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is sympathetic, but not excellent, as an unhappy sister who becomes obsessed with the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his short role). Geoffrey Land is fine, as is her girlfriend with the doctor. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the ultimate result with these cheap driving fast moves, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than being window dressing. "Sister Sherri" was the production of Poverty Row and shows occasionally (sets, special effects, etc.). Still, the movie has a heart, mostly decent playing and direction, and some true chills. Sam Sherman also saw that it is advisable to use Harry Lubin's music for the late '50s / early' 60s television series "One Step Beyond" in this film, which certainly contributes to the spooky atmosphere. The DVD contains two distinctly different film cuts (the early version includes a lot of T&A that run on the floor of the cutting room to create a way for more horrible things), as well as a theatrical trailer, TV spot and great commentary. Sherman. Anyway, does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Besides John Carradin, he is the best actor I've ever seen in al-Adamson's film, and he plays a cult leader like he thinks.
