Not because "Harold and Maude" has suicide so successfully used as a theme for a love story. Playing, at the top of the notch is amazing. With a well-structured scenario, things are developing at a pleasant pace. There are black comedy moments, but I would classify "my suicidal heart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both moving and engaging. Does the film actually question you, what is the normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Look for it on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You won't be disappointed. - MERK
