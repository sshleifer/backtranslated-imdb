That was the movie that in the end, I thought, "Now it was a nice 2 hours!" I hate spending about $ 20 (including baby-sitting $ $) for my husband and myself to feel it was fine. I think I like Will Smith better than a comedy actor than an action hero. He was well occupied. His character was very sympathetic, as was Kevin James. Several loud scenes laughed. It's also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress a lady in your life, take it to it. Women like her, just like any young, but I wouldn't say it as one. There's a lot of humor for men who can enjoy it. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie is as perfect as the date. He has romance and grotesque. I usually don't like slapstick, but it wasn't an exaggeration and I can't think of those scenes that wouldn't be heard. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me when she was done was "I want to see it again!"
