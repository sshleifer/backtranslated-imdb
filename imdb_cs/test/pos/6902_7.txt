This movie was fun if it was all over the album. Basically a comedy novel by two graves of criminals in England in the 19th century follows, moving from conventional body tidying up to trading vampires, zombies, and dead Roswell aliens. (I have no idea what Roswell's stranger was doing there, and I don't even think producers.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You bet. Even Ron Perlman, who is often kissed by Direct to DVD Death, was good at this as a priest who proved to be the leader of a rival gang of attackers. The real pleasure to watch this hilarious little movie, and a good example of what you can do if you don't have greater than ego life on both sides of the camera.
