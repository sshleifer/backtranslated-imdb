Ghoulies 4 is a pretty ghoulish sequel. The ghouls look very different from the first three ghouls, but it's still fine. There are some nice flashes, from the Ghoulies of the first movie. Jonathan is in this again. However, it was not in sections 2 or 3. The movie is sometimes low but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. Ghouls in this movie are actually good guys, instead of evil as in the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have a very hot Alexandra! It's a great dark comedy and funny! Any ghoulies fan will enjoy watching the Ghoulies 4. The DVD is finally released in July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the US. I would really like to see the continuation of this movie one day too. I doubt it will happen. It's 2007 and no signs of continuation. If there is ever a continuation, I hope that Jim Wynorski will do it. I'm Ghoulies IV.
