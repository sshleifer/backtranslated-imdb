I'm not sure why I chose a "Nurse Betty" loan for my mom. I think just because I heard a bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did it. "Sister Betty" is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side. It was one of the first big Renee to hit her in Hollywood. I see why the actress is incredible. The scene where she finally realizes what happened, and she is on her favorite soap opera set, sees pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. To leave you in the movie, Betty plays. The shy and insecure woman standing by her rough husband is a waitress, and is in love with soap operas, especially where there is some cute Dr. Dr. Dave Revell. When they accidentally see her husband's murder in a separate room, the murders she notices are two customers she just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She then just loses her mind and leaves the city after talking to the police and says she needs to find her former fianc√©e, Dr. Dave Revell. She travels to California to find Dr. Revell, and wants to work as a sister to work with Dave, she has seen it so many times that she's just amazing when he's a sister when she saves a woman's brother. Despite the fact that everyone told her that she was deceptive, she just looks at them as if they're crazy. When he meets an actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks he's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. He just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and her are together. Renee was amazing, so believable she lost her mind in the movie. She has come so long way, and to dry that you want to admit or not, she is an adorable and great actress. Morgan Freeman plays one of the murderers, Charlie, who is the father of two. Betty is so enchanted and distraught, and when she pursues her all over the country, she becomes almost a mere Betty in love to almost fall in love with her. He and his son Wesley have to find Betty when he finds out he's on the murder scene. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she is scarred at first, but she calms down and knows they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. It's just great. Surprisingly decent performance of Chris Rock, son of Wesley. He is so "gun" - about how it does work in a hurry and take care of business. I loved his ending comedy show, where he and the gang holding the weapon point hostage were watching the soap operas. Classical. "Sister Betty" is a great movie that I would recommend for a good laugh and just in all nice fair little movie I think anyone could enjoy it. 9/10
