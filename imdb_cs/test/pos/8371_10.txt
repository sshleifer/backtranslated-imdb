Certainly the best film directed by Claude Lelouch after "L'aventure c'est l'aventure". The life inspiration of Jacques Brel is really present. Richard Anconina and Jean-Paul Belmondo have played a truly amazing duo and are really great at the psychological discovery of the two characters they play.
