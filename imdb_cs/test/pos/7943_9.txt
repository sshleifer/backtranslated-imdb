At school, I learned how some pictures were called and there were two directors: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I didn't care so much (I was a boy!) But now I know why Eisenstein is a genius and it is a shame to see what was possible in 1938, where countless empty movies got stuck for almost half a century! Some say this film is not worth the genius of Eisenstein (then they have to look at it again and again until they can say anything wrong), or worse, it's just some propaganda for the Russians. Say it as it is, is it really pure patriotism propaganda, but isn't it "Saving private Ryan" or "longest day"? Could I summarize so many movies where America rises to the top, so why not Russia and besides every war being fought for owners patriotism, why else would it lift the flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for anyone who takes care of cinematography because almost every picture is a noble picture. Maybe it's all overseen, but I'm wondering why it's not included in IMDB's Top 250, where there are many overrated Oscarcrapes.
