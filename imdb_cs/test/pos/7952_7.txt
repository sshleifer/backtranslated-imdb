Korean "romance" about a camera shop owner who is diagnosed with fatal disease. As it is a day-to-day job and is preparing for the end, it will become familiar with a young girl who is a customer. Friendship and romance are growing, but eve does not express any kind of affection for another. A good movie is unlike anything you will probably see in America, just because the studio insists that the "couple" will act on their feelings. He won't say anything because he doesn't have long enough to live, it won't be, because it's not what's going on and doesn't respond as he thinks. Of course, it is much more complicated than doing it, and in all honesty it is something you should discover for yourself. Is it a great movie? No, but it's good that moves you emotionally. The final lines of the film are still haunting me: "I always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you would stay in my heart just like in my last moment." Thank you and goodbye. It may seem strange in context, but it is very mobile in the context of the film.
