The third film by Polish brothers is their best, most beautiful, imaginative film. Although many viewers will have a problem with the lack of Northfork's traditional dramatic structure, "Hold on to it, Jack!" The storyline is difficult to summarize, so I just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate the city, God in a cowboy hat, sell the wings of the angels and sick orphan (but it all works). The extraordinary photography of M. David Mullen makes almost every shot an exciting and beautiful look. The performances of the actors, who work with the inspiring script of the Polish Brothers, are perfect and give the film an emotional blow. The highly attentive spectator will move in the mythology and folk tale of the story, comic and moving actors, and ultimately the incredible courage and command Michael Pol√°k shows behind the camera. Again, all these incredible and seemingly discontinuous elements come together in one of the most amazing things you should exhaust and experience. Great, great, great movie !!!
