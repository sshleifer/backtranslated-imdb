Despite all the concerns about TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLESE episode, BALANCE OF TERROR can only be the best episode of the show. And although I've always loved PIECE ACTION because it's so fun, I really have to vote because this Romulan episode is the best. The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the veiled Romulan ship and the Enterprise trying to destroy the Romulans before sneaking back through the Neutral Zone after a raid to Federation bases. In many ways, the show is similar to THE ENEMY BELOW - where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Curt Jurgens) are in opposition because they both try to outsmart others - and in the process develop unwavering respect for their enemy. Interestingly, there is only a short start of the episode on the planet - and it's amazing because the episode aboard the ship could have been easy static and boring. But because writing was so fantastic and the main characters wrote and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as Romulan leader). Oddly enough, for those hard Trekkers out there, they recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's father. The bottom line is that it's just a great and extremely engaging episode that keeps it on the edge of its seat.
