I remember reading the original Balzac story in French. I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago, who read him as one of his night gigs. He always loved the story, but they never believed they could make a movie out of it. To my surprise, they did it and did it PUBLIC well. Few Balzac stories are suitable for dramatization, which is unfortunate, and the lover I am, I have always hoped it would be without film. a lot of Hollywood sex. This is so close to perfect conversion as you could. The Theater of Mind is always better than what the eye can see, but it's as tight as I think it can bring the idea of ​​reading to meet the reality of vision.
