It's not denial. Science fiction on television is hard. There are so many problems that the genre brings. Like a good budget, solid writing, decent behavior. Perhaps the budget and scenario is a department where I believe most attempts have failed. So "Surface" succeeded? Not entirely, but more than most. As I see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of CGI to work, nor does it need a lot of money. What he needs is the ability to create a feeling greater than life. The feeling of being more than an eye, something that makes me curious and willing to try to figure out how it will end. Add pieces of puzzle and sometimes say "Ah!" is what makes or interrupts a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had several drawbacks. First, it is a basic assumption not as exciting as it could be, nor is the story revealed as exciting (or daring) as I had hoped for at the beginning. Also, the television feeling is very topical. All the way from a lousy CGI (which ranges from decent to terrible) to somewhat shifting quality in the acting department. Sometimes it is also a little too family-oriented in that it sometimes gets to the edge and becomes almost cutesy. Besides these shortcomings, it's a fun show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other science fiction. However, I managed to keep interest in the whole season and offer a few nice cliffs between the shows. The end is not so attractive to me. I don't like to show the end without saying it so the story remains unresolved. It is especially unfortunate in this case because the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is still undecided). <br /> <br /> HBO is the benchmark for quality TV. Their series has the best actors, the best production values ​​and most of all the strongest writing. This is not the quality of HBO, but it is good for what it is. Good enough to undoubtedly wish the next season.
