Don't ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it came at a time when I wanted to fit in, maybe it's amazing monster effects, maybe because I enjoyed the "Cabal" novel, that I love Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you a movie and the novel doesn't have a real determination, and like me you'll probably have a WTF moment in the end. At least two sequels were planned but never came about because the film collapsed for several reasons. The studio made a drastic cut of the cutting film a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they made HORRIBLE work to promote it. The ads seemed to look like another cheap slasher showing mainly the "Button Face / Mask" character of Decker. This is a monster movie! About fantasy! A place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are good guys. There is really nothing else like that! It's not a movie for anyone I suppose, but it's one of the many great works of Clive. Sit down and be ready to travel to Midian - where the monsters are.
