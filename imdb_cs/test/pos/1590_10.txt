Enjoy every moment of this picturesque spectacle with music to match (Mahler's 5th is beautiful, but listen to the voice of the third symphony so beautifully used in this movie). There are many aspects of this film, but the main theme is the strong power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also a passionate fan of Bogard and I believe he was rarely so wonderful (but try it in "Butler"). Note: I recommend multiple views.
