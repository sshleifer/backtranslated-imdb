I was walking through my local library, looking at VHS tapes when I saw a movie that caused me to drop my mouth - Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again - it's been over 22 years since I saw it (cable film channel around 78-79). I remembered a lot of details - especially the Grimes. My son, who is 4, and I watched it. He agreed with me that Grimes was "Not Nice", and the best way to describe it was that he didn't love Tom. He accepted it. It was amazing that I still remembered some songs! For 22 years I got stuck in my head - that means they had to have some memories, didn't they? It is a good children's film, with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through was not a nobility / company within the timeframe. This is what all kids face daily (except for a few happy ones), and while we try Disney-coat movies, which is more pc for kids these days, doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist - or not yet. I enjoyed the animation. It wasn't Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched the brush on this movie. However, there is a lot. David T plays two roles! (Much like him!) James M too. The water baths themselves are cute. I'm sorry about Tom and the root for him. Then Billie herself is extraordinary in the role she plays - it's like her eyes are magical! I am a huge fan of WoO, TLW & TW and the company (AND I LOOK FOR HP!) And I handed it along with such movies. Yes, he jumps into the water, but not for suicide. He jumped because he believed the lady in black - she had appeared to him all the time. I think this is a good movie! If you have children, pick up a copy of your rental. If you can find a purchase copy, let me know where! Ian liked it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
