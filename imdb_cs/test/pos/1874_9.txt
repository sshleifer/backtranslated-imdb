The original sci-fi channel company has created some pretty crappy movies (House of the Dead 2, Day of All Souls, etc.), but when you leave work on the horrible actor / writer master and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn for TV independent horror movies ever made! Normally I hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the Dead 2, I couldn't believe how horrible the movie was! But in some way I liked this movie, which is very good for this movie. Violence is good as well as black comedy in the movie and I recommend it to you, a true masterpiece of Bruce Campbell! Well, because there are only a few more lines left I can tell you what I want about this movie: IJAJKASIF JHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS DJKEALJWSNS.UHHD SISHSNHF AHCNAKDJH HNDCHJNDNH JACND HCHJNNHW JHJ NASHDNFHCKA FHNKHAD SAKASDADJ FJKDFA
