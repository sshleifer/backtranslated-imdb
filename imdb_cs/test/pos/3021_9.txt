Cracking and spectacular thriller about child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), desperately challenged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio) A serial killer who (uses strange and frightening torture tactics) is found in a coma federation. Novak wants in return from Dean where Stargher's last victim is, and if he's alive. As Deane gets into Stargher's mind, which has the form and atmosphere that resembles David Lynch's "Dune" or Wes Craven's "Blue Velvet" and "Nightmare on Elm Street," adventure begins. Deane sees various strange people from Carl as a young man (adorable Jake Thomas) to Freddy Krueger as a man without a razor. I don't want to say goodbye to the end, but the movie is great next to dynamite performances, Howard Shore's haunted musical score and direction (Tarsem, who shows that he can drive).
