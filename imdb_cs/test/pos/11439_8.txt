"The Gig" is a tight, witty and charming little movie about a group of friends who have been meeting regularly to play Dixieland for fun. The band unexpectedly lands in paid musical expression; "concert". They travel to NY for a two-week concert at the summer resort minus one member who bowed for cancer. At the last minute they hire a professional to take his place. Things become sticky when over-the-hill Frankie Valli tries to comeback at the resort and tries to use the band as their band. <br /> <br /> The attitude of a professional bass player was ringing. By signing up for a two-week concert, they took bread from someone who needed a job to feed their family. While the stars Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western and R&B earn from albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to make a living. Almost no one gets rich. Boys who live their dreams also cost others for the necessary income. I think that almost anyone who can play a musical instrument with some professional dreams about playing one or another valid concert, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur and professional crossover . I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has played music professionally. Mom, who was a musician, that LOVED.
