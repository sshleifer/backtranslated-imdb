Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: indulge. There is no point trying to "capture" this film. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. Herzog 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' has the same thing, though the film is less convincing because the peaks are at the beginning of the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature versus Kinski. However, Morte and Venezia are completely different because they have several peaks, turns, etc. In fact, since Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the film is almost "rushing" into its grand finale (its last grains of sand begin to run through the hourglass after a moment of bliss) when he fantasizes that he warns the Polish family and caresses Tadzi's hair). If you want, you can look for some real clues in this (his desire to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrived, at the end Tadzio pointed to the fact that they are absolutely sinc), but it doesn't make sense to do it: the film won't be better or worse because its strength lies throughout the story, which is never expressed. Tons of history, the crumbling Europe, the end of the "romantic era," as we have learned, which proved to be the beginning (individual emotions and expressions are now more important than ever). But wait, now I'm starting to develop one small (small) movie error: "let's talk about art" works. Now there's one thing you never do. I myself believe that it could have been expressed by other means. In addition, I believe that it is already clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't like explicit movies. I can read books so I don't want a story that just talks about my justification. I prefer films that you can't explain in words, but only in film (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick on Hanging Rock, and Roeg's man who fell on Earth belong to this category), and then only has a reason to exist as a film and not just as book. What is Thomas Mann's novel? I've never read it, but forget it! The film gives a different perspective: it says things you can never say in the book. It uses film art to make you feel, through pictures and music, the same thing that Mann felt about you using text. Equally brilliant, but different worlds.
