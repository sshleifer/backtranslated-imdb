Two hands are a very entertaining Aussie crime that ultimately succeeds in the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations to get the film right and feel. The film's comedy takes place naturally, and the laughter wasn't created too complicated and didn't work too much on them. It's really very funny, because every character in the movie is great, and every actor / actress realizes and can relate to Aussie humor. They render it very well and very realistic. Of course, the fantastic script writer / director Gregor Jordan is helping them immensely. I read another review of this movie from an American who saw it and criticized it, basically passing it on as a Pulp Fiction clone. I think it's just waste. This film does not seek to be a Pulp Fiction, the feel and style of each of these outstanding films are completely opposite. Without wanting to sound superior or arrogant, I think I will fully understand this film; humor, honesty, characters, etc. .... you must be Australian or at least understand the culture that the other one probably had no idea. Some Americans, whose reviews of some non-US movies seem to be ignorant (and have difficulty understanding) anything that is not an American product. It's a real shame because it's a really great movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also depicted in a very real, honest and sweet way. I'm very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
