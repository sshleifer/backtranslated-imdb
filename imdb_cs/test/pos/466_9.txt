This is really a movie you have to see twice. When I first saw this movie, I was really drawn into the story. While most stories take place in a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, a wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you away from their room and into the world. Through their conversations, you get the feeling of loneliness and the pain that feels. The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly, darkly, lo-fi and interestingly. When you see the movie a second time around you, you can pick up all the tracks you missed for the first time, leading to one of the best endings I've seen in a long time. I hope this movie will find a DVD distributor so it will be more accessible. Great movie, you won't be disappointed.
