In response to the "state of confusion" dog injuries seem to disappear somewhat suddenly, but it may have been just a mistake in continuity. But when it comes to children trying to build a plane out of waste, it's just a simple matter of imagination. They are two very young children who have extremely active ideas and have to rely on these ideas to remain exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that continues in their home from their stepfather. As for the stepfather, it is very interesting that the director decided not to show him his face. That makes him more monstrous. If you show his face, then this character becomes a man, not just this "monster" who terrorizes the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing that these are just cases of abuse and not focusing the scene on the abuse itself, children become the main focus of the film. This film has no free ends, but it runs just like the story of his father's children. She has an ornament. This is a great American classic.
