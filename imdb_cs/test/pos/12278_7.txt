The cultural filmmaker of Corbucci's rarest of his thirteen Spaghetti Westerns (of which I just left behind with what I do in the middle of the revolution [1972] to catch myself) is the one I only recently learned quite a few about through "Stracult Marco Giusti "guide; it is an uncharacteristically gloomy genre jewel in the style of the director's masterpiece, GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with a desolate snowy landscape. Johnny Hallyday, French Elvis Presley, whom I first saw at Jean DETEKTIV LUC Godard (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play loners against hero Hud (who, like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from Sergei Leone's famous "Dollars Trilogy" series, equipped with steel plate armor for protection); By the way, at the Venice Film Festival 2004, I met the overwhelming daughter of Hallyday Laura Smet, but I was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director Claude Chabrola! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving almost as much as Frank Wolff did in BIG SILENCE), but he is well-off and is awkwardly entertaining in the presence of Francois Fabian's bath; he then plays the greedy nymphomaniac widow of the banker who brings all his goals to his goals. Sylvie Fennec has another prominent female role as a farmer who takes care of Hallyday and who is pulled into Free Love by 'hippie' Apache in one place Gabriella Tavernese (noteworthy that the film is surprising, but to welcome bouts of nudity both Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally, the anachronistic addition of many long-haired youths (who also deal with smoking and revolutionary conversation) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary significance? but all of this contributes to the fun (except that a black bartender does an afro haircut!). Mario Adorf is also looking forward to the smaller role of Mexican Mexican city. bandit nicknamed "El Diablo" ?? who keeps a young biographer still by his side (an element that could influence Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and, in one place, challenges captured Moschin to head-butting duel! After mentioning it, the film also contains one very unusual 'death weapon'? how Hallyday kills an opponent by kicking the salon's box office into his face! As always, pleasantly fake fistfights are accompanied by exaggerated sound effects; equally typical of the genre, however, wistful score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino appears the most significant asset. Actually, the ambiguous ending is totally consistent with the movie's generally somber tone? after joining Fabian in the hands of the locals, the hippies (who previously adored Huda) suddenly turned against him when they injured and terrorized the city (forcing everyone on the street and not closed)? to meet their challenge (but they look out at the prospect of it!) and then leave the city, leaving Fennec behind. in Italian, though with French credits and occasional extinction? about one minute of projection time in all? to the French language (where the original soundtrack was probably not available).
