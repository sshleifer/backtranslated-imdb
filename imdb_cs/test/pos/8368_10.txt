I was born in Beijing, China and at the age of 9 I moved to the United States. Several times I was home in Beijing and always loved. One of the many things I love about Beijing are the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hau hao hao shuo" (which more accurately translates "if you have something to say, say it nicely") beautifully and truly captures the feeling of Beijing. I think you would have to live and understand Beijing and its people a bit to make the most of this movie, even if you can enjoy it no matter what. The story is not complicated, intentionally a bit unpredictable and captivating. I'll let it unfold by itself and not tell you too much, except for some comments. Every detail, from the pictures on the wall to the decorations, streets and restaurants, feels at home. (Zhang Yimou most likely shot everything "on the spot") But more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the little girl, the kind but unhappy "laptop man", and the owner of the nightclub are each originally from Beijing and kind in a different way. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mostly driven by situations and conversations (except the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is interesting and always interesting. I'm now 21 years old. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so impressed with Zhang Yimou's ability to turn ordinary people into credible characters on the screen and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "keep cool" - different. hilarious. meaningful.
