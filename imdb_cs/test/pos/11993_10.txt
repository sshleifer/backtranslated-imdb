One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly offered as a "in-name only" sequel. There's nothing wrong with that: The return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webba. This connects the viewer with this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think or want the Caddyshack II to be similar to the first. There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was to return. He carried a large portion of the first film, so his return would put Caddyshack 2 over the top. Jackie Mason is a "new" Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, though their comic supplies are different. Dan Aykroyd was great but not enough in the movie. He should be involved in how much time Bill Murray got on screen. Robert Stack (Airplane!) He was in the "new" role of Ted Knight / Villian good. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan was supposed to be back. So many others could go back to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not go through the overall adjustment he has made. Instead of the club itself, they should instead be the main focus of the character on the club itself. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that this is not a major sequel and maybe you think it's another good or bad eighties comedy. First fans should see it, but don't be shocked when the comparison between the original and Part II is so far apart.
