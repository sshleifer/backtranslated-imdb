What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but I was familiar with his live and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I never cared about Gary Bussey, he was wonderful as Buddy Holly! I don't know exactly what the movie is, but I assume that at least for the most part it is accurate, making the film more interesting. Music in the whole movie just adds pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change anything in this movie, it was all good! What's the difference between the 50s and today's stars. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? or any of the other popular singers of this generation?
