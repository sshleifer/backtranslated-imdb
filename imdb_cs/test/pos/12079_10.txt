"Who Will Love Your Children" The saddest movie I've ever seen. Definitive 10/10. Published on television in 1983. The film was released on VHS. DVD release is a must, sooner than later. A mother dying of cancer must find homes for all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of children are unable to take care of them once she has died. He can find homes for children except one, a young boy who doesn't want to because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you didn't want to. In a real good tearker, take your hands in this movie. I'm a man, even though I wept while watching this movie. Do not miss.
