Pulling in 2.6 million viewers, one has to wonder what all the views of the story / plot is. Reading down for life, I was led to believe that it would be the edge-of-your-thriller about how a single mother is chasing and finally confronting a stalker. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While the main plot is interesting enough - one mother runs away one night, then is followed by the same guy, the reasons behind the persecution left nothing but a really bad taste in the mouth. Laura Leighton plays the sacrifice, well. Whether it was all these years at Melrose Place or not, he's doing well in this movie, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from damage, and she looks pretty good these days. Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people identify with the main character, after finding out why the stalker is being pursued, it will be a movie that will only be shown once.
