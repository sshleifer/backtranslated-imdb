The filmmakers have made a somewhat boring story of each person looking interesting and comprehensive with a focus on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than documentary. I hardly ever feel like I have experienced something that is randomly deep, which makes it all the more thorough. <br /> <br /> The film has visually interesting inner moments. He absolutely loved the way the filmmakers took me. (Quite a lot of Europeans in credits). Hopefully PBS will show it to reach a wider audience in the US.
