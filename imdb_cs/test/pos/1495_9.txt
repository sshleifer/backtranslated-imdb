"Mr. Bean", starring with legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during his run in the 1990s, and I probably saw him for the first time when I was around ten, shortly after he finished, so I saw the reps. At that time, I was definitely not a fan and I didn't see too many episodes. In fact, I didn't get into the show until my teens, just a few years ago when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, I chuckled many times and since then it has always been a repeat of episodes! Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial, extremely naive buffon whose best friend is his Teddy! It is largely isolated from society and life is not easy for it because it continually struggles with very simple things! This is because it lacks some basic knowledge and has a child's mind. He finds himself in all sorts of issues wherever he goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try to solve the problems he faces! Not only does it often cause problems for yourself, but sometimes for other people, which they often don't realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walk disaster! The humor in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue. Gags are almost always gags, which is mostly what the show is about. While there may be occasional bland wounds, I would say the vast majority of them are funny, often cheerful. While "Mr. Bean" is definitely not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for many of those who like visual humor, and due to the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak English to enjoy the show, is why it has earned such a worldwide reputation! The show ran several years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were made in total. However, this is a classic series, and deserves its wide appeal!
