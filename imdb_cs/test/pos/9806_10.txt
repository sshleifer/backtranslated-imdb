I believe this is pulling the heart. Richard Donner (directing the best grossing movie "Superman") has done a great job directing this movie. Some segemets were good and some of them were terrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was defeated by the king (Baldwin and especially their dog, Shane attacked the king, which meant he paid for what he did to Bobby). Elijah Wood, who portrayed a good role in this film, an unforgettable scene in this dream, dreamed of taking buffalo advice on how Bobby beats, and Lorraine Bracco (Pre-Soprano) portrayed an impressive role. br /> <br /> I give this movie *** of four !!!
