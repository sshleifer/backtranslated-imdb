It's a shame that this movie is rated PG 13 - it is really quite suitable for everyone - even though little kids may not follow it too well. It belongs to this amazing genre of seri-comic ghost / angel stories that would have to include everything from Capra's "It's a wonderful life" to Wenders' "Wings of Desire". The photo is overwhelming, it's the first speed and - the wonder of wonder - the tone is uplifting. My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity. film. These two intertwined stories initially seem mysteriously mysterious; but for my taste, they were too decent. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the components of Irwin's story are on his bedside table. Symbolism is just a little thing to me. But what a jester! My favorite scene must be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast in the dining room. This is practically theatrical in its magic - a tour of the power of humorous acting - soft, playful and positively rhythmic - coupled with remarkable cinematography and acute eye for slapstick. "Northfork" is funny, touching, beautiful to look at, magical (with the above mentioned reservations) and has no career. Easy nine stars.
