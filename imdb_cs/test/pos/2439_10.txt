This is one of my favorite movies ever! together with the casablanca and the cannibal holocaust it is an almost perfect cinema. Rex Allen tells this amazing story of a bomb that needs just a little loving. includes action, adventure, tension, comedy and chaos! KNOW THIS FILM IF YOU CAN DO IT! You will not find a better cat image anywhere, with a "cat from space" coming as not so close to the other. Charlie's performance is beautiful. even includes animal cruelty and intensive timber harvesting! I have to love Disney, for all moral failure!
