Cardiff, Wales. In this city, a bunch of 5 friends are deeply bored. There's Jip working in a clothing store. Coop, easy DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend, Lulu and Moff. Week is a hell for them and just waiting for one thing: for the weekend. At that time they got into a nightclub and experienced drugs without music, especially ecstasy. Then they usually continue in the friend's side. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the feelings are: fatigue, melancholy, just a memory of a crazy night ... Surfing the wave of the notorious success of "Trainspotting" (1996), this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation of hedonism. This means: how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have reduced time. Indeed, as I wrote earlier for the 5 main characters of the film, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without a single pressure (besides, Jip talks about the positive aspects of filming in one sequence: you are numb , you feel no pressure, you're like an astronaut in orbit above the ground, the staunch directorial style of Kerrigan expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and wear and tear of the five protagonists, and they live to make the most of the hedonistic weekend. With his film bathing, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream sequences that represent the imagination or embarrassment of his characters. "Human Traffic" (1999) is also handled mainly by a bouncy soundtrack that is a perfect symbiosis of sound and music, at the end of the euphoria week which makes it possible to temporarily hide the sound Inematography has studied a lot. <br /> <br /> Although the film (conscientiously or not) uses the glory of another famous film, it seldom matches its brilliance. predecessor. "Human traffic" is in this state. There is little ingenuity at the level of narrative structure and the showing of characters, and one may perceive several useless branches (Jip who, in a nightclub goes to the executive office and tells him a cock-and-bull story so to how to allow Moff to join the club, but that There is nothing better because he can do without problems, one can also blame Kerrigan for overlooking the dramatic parties that the story might have involved, and his film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia, and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are not practically explored. It could bring the following message: even in the happiest moments, there might be something terrible to prepare for them, and the same remark can be made when Coop has a jealousy because Nina pulls a guy. <br /> <br / It may not be the last great movie from the 1990s when it is billed on a DVD cover, but "Man." k Traffic needs to be seen as a good and penetrating little film that expresses the styles and fashion of the late twentieth century, the will to have fun without side motives and problems. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to the club.
