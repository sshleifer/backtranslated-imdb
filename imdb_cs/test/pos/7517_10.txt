Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this evil comedy / drama / whodunit. The hospital shown here is full of problems ... from protesting neighbors who can place patients on a potential serial killer. George C. Scott is the best doctor who, on the verge of his own nervous breakdown, joins the carefree Diana Rigg and her unusual father Barnard Hughes. HOSPITAL is alternately depressed and agitated and contains some of the most acidic dialogues that can be imagined (note how Scott describes his love for Rigg). She also has a lot of great vignette: Scott berating head sister Nancy Marchand after one of them underlings accidentally kills the doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen is desperate to collect information about insurance from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott soberly talks to a hospital psychiatrist after telling him about his wretched life. All actors are first class. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The film is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's screenplay, which earns a well-earned Oscar (through such a tough competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening story is priceless.
