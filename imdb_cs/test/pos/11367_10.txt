It was so long ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and I often wished it to reappear. I took it with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a photo of a tapestry (actually charcoal) used for credits. <br /> <br /> My family and I gathered around our black-and-white TV to drink in Shakespeare's words on the opening theme of "Bayco's" Elizabethan Mask, "as a group of great but relatively unknown players said (at least at the time of American audiences) . We were introduced to these actors such as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have enjoyed their successes ever since. One of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued in their roles as they were presented by Shakespeare's play "King", perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. I wish I could tell those actors how much the series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would please those of us who want to see it again and those who came for the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS!
