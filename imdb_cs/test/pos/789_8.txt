He saw it for the first time on UK TV, with good music. The elevator scene is classroom, especially when it does what's going on in the phone booth and then plays with the floor indicator. Jumping over the transom is really impressive and there is much more. Except for all the things mentioned earlier, there's a fight with a man who bullyed a woman with a dog - it just looks so simple. The only drawback is the conspiracy - he gets a laugh with Dead Eye Dan, who then escapes, but does not reappear, even if other gangsters join him later. The scene where it looks like shooting at the fat inspector is funny, but it would be better if Dead Eye pulled the trigger.
