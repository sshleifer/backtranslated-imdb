Ocean is 12 <br /> <br /> 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) This saying will surely be heard in this sequel. Terry Benedict was informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who tore him and now he wants it back. The ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but it can't work in states because Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's out of Europe to do death-defying acts while trying to avoid the super cop Catherine Zeta Jones, an old flame from Rusty (Pitt's). At their first robbery in Amsterdam, they found out that they were hit by "Night Fox", a super slender thief with a complex of legends. It gives them a challenge that could write their debt in full or land them in some sort of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow down? Somehow. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? A lot. The ocean and his group of cheerful men are charismatic, if nothing else, and because it's a sequel and we're all old friends, we see a lot of "pally" situations and conversations. Too much. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; cousins ​​are bickering as we knew; Bernie Mac's power of talk and Don Cheadle's co-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle, but I couldn't keep it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, complement each other's glasses and read each other's mind. However, what worked so well in the last movie was the lack of character development versus how neat the whole damn op was. And as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this movie like a big square pin in a tight 11-sided hole. She just doesn't fit and her chemistry doesn't exist with Pitt. The stars of this movie for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as Night Fox and Soderbergh's site selection. Cassel plays pompea and wealth as if he were born into both. His night fox is arrogant, "terribly cavalier with the lives of other people" (Danny Ocean) and the overall contrast to the Ocean Gang. This is where I think the film is losing its way. The Cassel and European sites provide too realistic a contrast with American actors and the style of the first film. We want slippery, cheeky and fast-witty; it is not bold, thoughtful and intellectual. This is where the movie doesn't work. I admit that you can't repeat the same formula twice on a letter, but going far left or right usually does more harm than good in a mainstream movie like this. .
