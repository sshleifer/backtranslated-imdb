I saw Chomps during - approximately - 2 days of his theatrical release. It's a wonderfully cute and fun "Benji" movie, though it's much better and more actor-focused than dogs. The simple display of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by bullying and villains who receive their desert deserts, is pleasing and pleasing. This is also a provocative mindset. This film affects awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Films have different genera and different purposes. Pleasing to all ages, this movie offers an interesting, humorous look at your own experience. Everyone knows the personality and types of behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see humor. Humor makes this step enjoyable and brings a new level of understanding of life situations. <br /> <br /> Chomps is a great choice for a funny laugh and a "good feeling" movie. Rememberable.
