OK, so this movie is not very well known, and it wasn't very well publicized. I discovered this rather brutal gangster off a good movie by a complete accident on one of the millions of Skys movie channels late for some boring evening, but I like launching this movie is fantastically comic In a very dark way. It actually sets what I think is a general tone for the movie. I think many critics and movie fans who have actually seen this movie was a little unfair when you write it down as a lower gangster movie budget in the Reservoir Dogs.OK vein, but between Thursday and some other genre films that have been compared, there are undeniable similarities, but I think it's in all respects the film has a much darker comic look at this type of film, and the end result is engrossing, well done, funny, if not completely original movie He serves the recognition he now hopefully gets thanks to The Punisher. \ tHis performance as a bad guy good is realistic, funny and cool enough to make you believe that Casey was a really bad ass before he reformed. This is another thing that makes this movie stand out for me, the character. In Nick's gang, you get the strangest trio of criminals who have ever gathered, a smooth, charismatic but very cool leader (Nick), triggering a happy blood-loving female sexually predatory female (Dallas), and a psychotic hill of Billy with brains with a penchant for Billy Hill. sometimes seen on the screen, beautifully over played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well on Thursday really. It is occasionally dark comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal but always riveting and worth watching.
