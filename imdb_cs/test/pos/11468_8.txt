I have found that this movie is enjoyable and includes watching, and I am surprised that it is rated so low. Actually, I see why this is so; I imagine they are Eric Robers and Alyssy Milano fans, who gave most of the 1s and 2s, because if you put a tape in a machine waiting to watch something that one or both of them play, then you might be rather disappointed. Eric appears about half an hour to the end of the film, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those she says little and wears less (though never naked if that's what you're looking for, stick to the vampire embrace). Although they are always a pleasure, it's a shame that she or Eric don't get much time on the screen, but I'm still giving it 8. <br /> <br />
