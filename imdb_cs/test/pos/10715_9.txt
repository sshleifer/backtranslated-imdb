Inexplicably I watched this film for the first time a few days ago and from the very beginning I understood what the fuss is about. This film captivated me from start to finish and led me through a whole spectrum of emotions (and maybe helped me discover a few I never knew.) Dustin Hoffman is totally like Ted Kramer. She is absolutely convincing because one has to juggle with at least three different challenges in life: a joking husband, a workaholic and an executive adept and a loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central in the movie because Joanna was missing for her good part, but when she was on the screen she gave Hoffman money for her money. But the real standout, in my opinion, had to be a young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always an innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed completely natural and totally believable in this role because he deals with conflicting emotions around his mother and adapting to life with his dad only after he has to confuse why he should leave his father when his mom came out to him. Young Justin in this very difficult role does not seem to miss his defeat. All in all, this is an excellent Oscar film whose only weak point was that I was really disappointed with the decision to go for a clever and happy ending that was totally unrealistic due to the destructive custody of Ted and Joanna who had gone through. But there's nothing else to complain about. 9/10
