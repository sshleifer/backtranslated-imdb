I first saw this movie on television in 1959 when I was eight years old. I didn't know anything about Westerns, but I met Ben Johnson from "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to the "Wagon Master" were great songs sung by "The Sons of the Pioneers". Merian C. Cooper, who made the film, was the first to introduce original music to match the mood of a particular scene, creating a modern film soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create a mood for his classic King Kong work. Steiner would later win an Oscar for "Gone With the Wind". Cooper was also the producer of "The Mighty Joe Young." If you remember, the music was important to the big monkey that would only respond to Stephan Foster's sound "The Beautiful Dreamer." "Master of the wagon." Of all the famous Ford's Westerns, this is my favorite one, representing his brother Francis and the annoying Janes Arness.
