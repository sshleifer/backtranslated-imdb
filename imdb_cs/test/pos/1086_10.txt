This is by far one of the best movies India has ever made. The film's plus points follow ... <br /> <br /> Amazing direction, cinematography and editing, editing is very smooth and the timing of changes is excellent. The film shows the life of Mumbai policemen and their hardships, never getting bored or compassionate. Nany Patekar. One can certainly hope to be nominated for the best actor of the Academy Awards. Controlled Violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not become a bloody mess. No silly songs like usual Indian movies. <br /> <br />
