Lackawanna Blues is an excellent movie. The cast was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfect for the role they played. Their chemistry was amazing. The acting was excellent. I felt like I knew characters. I could almost 'feel' them. They reminded me of people I knew that as a child he grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. Oh, memories! My personal belief is that this movie was supposed to be on the big screen so everyone could see it. I've watched this movie so many times that I can almost recite lines as the characters say. I can't even list my favorite part because I have so favorite parts. Thank you for bringing a part of my youth I never see on this day and age ... and that is because Black people love, look at each other, respect each other, take care of each other and do everything we can help each other. I have to go. I have to watch it again.
