The most notable feature of this film is chemistry between actors, a sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dance. This typical rising star musical has a redesigned plot, even for 1944, but it's still fun to watch because of the actors. Hayworth is not so much a dancer, but she has a lot of "inexperienced" spell that suits her. Kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers provides a lot of self-deprecation and laughs. The film may be sometimes very serious. It's not necessary to see it, but recommended if you like actors.
