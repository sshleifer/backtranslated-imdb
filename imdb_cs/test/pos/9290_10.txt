This show is a non stop merriment. The first joke will be on wet pants. And that's probably the weakest of them. I started watching him when the second half of season 2 started and now. I am addicted. just 2 weeks after I started watching. I downloaded the episodes and bought a DVD. Reoccurring Clips As "Ad Road Test" and "current affairs" are quiet merry. Then there's the ad's take off "Use Emo. Use your own tears for more effective use" Also Funny in Party Things policy. Nothing happens to them. it is funny. Any Australians who don't find the funny one. Complain and don't look at it. ALL Australian TUNE On Wednesday at 9 ABC
