I saw the beginning of the Muppet movie, but only half. Because I only watched it with Mrs. Kelly's friend. The songs were the best and the muppets were so cheerful. They learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow, whoever can do it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was part of the trailer). Kermit is my favorite protagonist (Which means he describes the main character) And so are the other muppets. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor Max Krassman. A scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by doing Kung Fu on those guys. That was so cool. The Muppet movie is the best Jim Henson movie with the most cheerful characters and people will honor it for its successful film.
