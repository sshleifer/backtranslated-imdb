Hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. This movie seemed to be intended for young children, but I know that this film will appeal to adults. The storyline is very simple. The boy who moved to Florida must help the football athlete and the outcast who save the owls from the pancake design. The message in this film is especially great for animal activists and lovers. The message is that you can save everything you can. The action in this film is decent. All three children seemed to have good chemistry. Music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's songs in this movie. Overall, it's a good family movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
