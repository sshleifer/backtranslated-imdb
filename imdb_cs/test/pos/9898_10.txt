I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a wonderful combination of pleasing story and great cast. Director Jeff Hare has done an excellent job and invited the audience to the disparate but cheerful world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy crazy antiquity, yet we feel the real pain and worry they have for themselves. Typically I'm not a fan of Peter Falk, but it's Morris Applebaum and plays a role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will see this amazing movie and enjoy it the way I did. Director's Hats, Cast and Crew for a Job Well Done!
