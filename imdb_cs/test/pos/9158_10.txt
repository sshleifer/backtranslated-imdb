As I recall, my family decided to stay home at night "Nichols" (Monday? Tuesday? NBC?). It was an excellent car for James Garner, a very well written, great file cast. His character is very similar to "Support Your Local ...": A retired gambler with a mysterious past settles in town and has an adventure every week. In fact, it seemed quite obvious that it was the same. It was just a TV show charger. Sleeper, like "My World and Welcome to It", which could be his current - I forget. I really wish these shows were available on DVD. It was Just Good TV. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." closer, but only a mile.
