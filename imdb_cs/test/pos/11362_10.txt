Anyone who has enjoyed this series when first airing (I hurried home from school to see it) is now at a certain age, so I can only add my comments to those who ask for DVD release so that those of us can relive memories of the first transmission before it simply becomes a piece of unforgettable history of the TV archive. If it is possible to release so many old TV series from the 1960s and 1970s, why not? Of course, it cannot be that rights will have such problems. Most of Shakespeare's lines, which I can quote, come from this iconic series and I remember exchanging them with my school friends when we tried to surpass the memories of the text. Peter Dews rightly deserved credit for showing her on the screen. This was certainly a public service broadcast. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery are fighting to death - it's a riveting thing and since the start of the golden age of BBC Television. Come on the BBC. Clear it and do it, please. March 2009 There's finally a DVD and congratulations to those who did it. The image quality is remarkably good and the performances are as good as they thought. All those trying to do it must buy them and relive these magical moments. British viewers. Since the show was produced in the UK by the BBC using British actors, it's strange that the DVD release is not available on Region 2 DVD and can only be imported from the US and played on modified players. It seems scarcely likely that there will be fundamental rights issues, perhaps that the market was considered too small, so why wasn't a "free region" released on Earth? so everyone could enjoy it?
