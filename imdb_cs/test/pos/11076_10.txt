I just wanted to inform anyone who might be interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite all the time. I admire the work that Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of the film. This film made me quite impressed by his reality and the award of life detail in New Jersey. Personally, I thought it because I grew up with friends like those in the movie. This made me feel more impressive because I spent a few years in Teaneck, so some characters remained "real". Sometimes this movie seemed like a document because you didn't know if it was a real event. Although movies such as "Hooded Boys" and "Threat Society II" catch more attention, I personally feel that these movies have been somewhat "improved" to reach a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising piece of reality in your face. Lee and Gomez cover every detail in this urban drama from music, clothing, slang and location. Nothing was compromised to make "theater" good. The only misfortune that came from this film was the fact that many people “slept” on it. I look forward to other works by Nick and Spike in the future.
