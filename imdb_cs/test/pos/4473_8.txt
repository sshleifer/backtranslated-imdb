A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard that is very reminiscent of an "English patient," even to a scene similar to that of Ralph Fiennes's bearer carries his lover's body over a desert rock cliff. In "The Passion in the Desert", the main character carries the leopard's body through the desert rock, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically widespread from the very short story Balzac, the film is not perfect, but to heal not less. The final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10)
