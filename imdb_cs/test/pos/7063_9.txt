No, it's not a Kane citizen. But do you expect it to be called "Meatballs"? It's the best damn summer camp of all summer camp movies. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? This is just one of those movies that got into my brain when I was in junior high, and I stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel geeky, I murmur "Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz." Or when we go to the forest, I tell my husband, "I'm Wudy da Wabbit." (He won't get it). "It just doesn't matter. It doesn't matter." This thing is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with DVD. I wish there were special features, maybe commentary or creation. However, the film itself is the perfect moment of a youth's life in the late 1970s. Maybe not my life ... You can't help but want to run around in the forest in shorts and knee socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie.
