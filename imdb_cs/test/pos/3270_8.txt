Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gets a simple job from Panda (Bryan Brown), an underworld who tries to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door, Jimmy decided to dive into the beach for some time, but he he notices that his clothes on the sand have been broken and ten thousand are gone. Jimmy rings Panda to tell him a problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys are trying to find Jimmy, which means Jimmy won't have anything to do if he turns to him. So now Jimmy is hiding to organize a bank robbery to get Panda's money back. Also during this mess he meets the innocently sweet Alex (Rose Byrne) and together they find themselves in a hell of driving through King's Cross in Sydney. "Two Hands" is simply a stunning pick-me-up movie that's fresh, exciting and incredibly fresh. What you have here is largely an urban gangster movie with a greedy background and face to face violence? what, how do you ask the fresh one? Well, because it takes us to the underworld, where Australian culture shines criminals who wear thongs and shorts with panties, ready cars and a can of beer in their hands? And don't forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that it owes its inspiration to a lot of the likes of "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (my child) and "Lock, stock and two smoke barrels", but for me it still stands on its own. The film has a real blend of light moments, but also an average stripe with unexpected shocks and black humor that can actually be distracting. You just don't know what's coming and have a nice touch of cheerful irony (especially ending) and great timing with humor. One scene with bank robbery will keep you in stitch, I guarantee you. The plot of the plot is really a story of aging (or a path that has not been taken), has added a punching love story and then a gangster element to finish it. Most of the parcels have been cleverly constructed and intertwined, maybe it could be without a supernatural element that would include Jimmy's dead brother, but in the overall context, a diverse plot seems to be all together. An intense, natural and crisp dialogue has filled the incredibly colorful scenario with fast Aussie slang / twang strikes - I'm a fair dinkum! What the movie really did was Bryan Brown Panda's performance. He simply gave his character an ominously charismatic / ugly personality that when he wasn't on the screen his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides - one to be prick, but the other side is such a good guy. Young Rose Byrne shines with Alex's nervously sweet / unpredictable figure. She looked wonderfully beautiful and added a lively personality. Then you have Heath Ledger who is like naive Jimmy. Great accompaniments include Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. Such brutal performances are achieved, and you will be captivating, entertaining and credible. Pumps rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd provide a cool atmosphere. Also, shooting on the Sydney Cross in Sydney has helped him with his own life and shows the Australian way of life. Gliding camera tricks captured the city's background great, especially the piercing nightlife. It was a movie that when I was finished I was completely satisfied with what I got. Overall, this is a fast-paced crime thriller that achieves what it intends to do ... fun, clever and crazy roller coaster rides and excitement. , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "Director / Writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film.
