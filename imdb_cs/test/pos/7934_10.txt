Nevsky is one of the great epic war films. Certainly, others, such as the Nation's Birth and Napoleon, came earlier, but this is equally influential. Acting is in stock, but anyone who knows about Eisenstein first would know it was part of his film theory. Unlike many of his silent works, this film is about a heroic individual as well as a group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that came to the forefront by 1938. But his film shows us the power that people who come together can fight something they perceive as evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is different from the others. The film's romantic angles provide a more personal story than before. Not all elements work and the movie is probably a little too long, but it still resonates.
