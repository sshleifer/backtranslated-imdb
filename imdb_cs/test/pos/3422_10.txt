I haven't seen a movie for a long time that has pushed me and so grabbed me; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I pulled the loo; and I didn't even want to pause because I was being dragged directly. Emotive; strong; very mobile; terrible and brittle heart. This gives you an amazing insight into South Africa; their struggles and their lives. Negotiations by the leaders were overwhelming, and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that have unfolded in this film and how horrible the story is; I was biased. I don't even want to try to explain this story; it is too complicated and I would not do justice. See. you will understand why when you do it. Cheers, Hol
