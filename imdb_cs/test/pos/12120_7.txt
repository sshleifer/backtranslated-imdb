One of the Fuller (veteran combatant himself) early work of average quality, but exactly affects many conflicting aspects of life in postwar Germany. The main character starts the film in April '45 as Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div who really ended the war in Munich as in the movie. (The same unit fought last month in Aschaffenburg and then the liberated part of the Dachau facility). A flip flopping between the portrayal of good and bad German people may seem confusing to an uninformed film. But anyone who was there or at least read well would know that most of what is shown in the film is what really happened in 45-47 Germany. The only inaccuracy that I noticed was small: while on a boat trip on the Rhine, he walked through the remains of the Remagen Bridge that had crossed there. But his unit really crossed the south of Worms Germany.
