Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard - did you expect an entertaining movie that the whole family could enjoy? Apparently these and other directors were chosen because they did not follow the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they did not follow the original story of the opera - How often does the music in the film directly relate to what is happening in the film? It's a mood that counts. That's what I believe the directors of these films did: create a modern mood for old operas. Usually they succeed great. With all these operas they like. We could have used more Beverly Sills. Finally, what is art (and opera) without a few naked women?
