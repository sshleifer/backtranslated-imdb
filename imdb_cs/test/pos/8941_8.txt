This film had a distinct Woody Allen feeling, so if you're not a fan of dry humor, dark humor or background humor, you might find something else. However, if they are, it is unpredictable, with some nice twists and smooth, natural dialogue. The story itself is quite intriguing, not quite like a train wreck from which you can't turn your eyes off, but close. I mean in the best possible way. There are plenty of intrigues, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are downright sweet. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. Going 8.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
