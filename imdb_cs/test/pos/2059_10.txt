This movie is a great run of action and comedy, it gets straight into it right from the start, not boring to build. Major role chemistry contributes to the excitement and expectation of the end, although my suspicion has not been satisfied. The special effects were brilliant and believable! He would like another ending, but it still wandered with emotions. The story unfolds well, but it's a movie you have to watch carefully from start to finish to pick up all the details to fully understand and get the maximum enjoyment. <br /> <br />
