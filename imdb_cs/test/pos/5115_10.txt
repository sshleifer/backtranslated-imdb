This film brings me so many memories! I was very young when it came out, but I remember when I first saw it! My dad and I would always be watching "Ernest Movies" together. Within a few years we haven't seen any of them and found a few of them really cheap. We watched them and we couldn't stop laughing. I like all the "Ernest Movies" but this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler section! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" section. My dad still makes the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End spoiler! This is a very ugly movie ... but great! It's ideal for families (it's not like a lot of garbage), but adults can laugh! If you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move), then it's a movie for you!
