I'll give it as clearly as possible for those of you who don't know about Bill Hicks' inheritance. He was just the greatest comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion, the greatest ever lived (his stand-up idol was a great Richard Pryor, whose battles with the addiction he had paralleled). His death in 1994 barely recorded in the popular media barely a few weeks after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. His tragic death at such a young age conceals any sense of injustice that has been criminally ignored during his life. But the harsh truth is clear as day: no one has stepped out to push his cloak. There is no stand-up comedian alive with almost skill and invention. Observation is done in a loving homage `It's just a ride 'that stand-up comedians often view work as stepping Stone to richer endeavors - lame movies and morally driven sitcoms that occupy - but never contribute - The lives of an unimaginable audience. It's all that Bill Hicks talked about. His sermon has always been a commemorative cry for people who thought it was necessary to control authority, to meet as one race. His appeal continues to grow every year since his death. His star will continue to light long after so many smaller lights have exploded. Once you are exposed to your brilliant, intelligent but ultimately compassionate ascent, you will be enriched and rewarded. He himself liked to quote Dylan: "To live out of law that you must be honest with," he said. Bill Hicks was honest, except he was the most fun of them.
