This is probably my favorite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alexa, who is a PERFECT woman! Always laugh at me and feel good when I watch this show. It's just something that's amazing, hard to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all episodes also sync with music albums. Here are some examples. (Episodes start again when they're finished - but DO NOT play the final credits to the end, but always play the opening credits. With most episodes, the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some continue.) FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double Bogey' Kid A / OK Computer (episode plays at least four times) 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Of Love <br /> <br /> 2.19 'The World Without Alex' Kid A / Wish You Were Here / Pablo Honey (episode plays at least 4 times) There are tracks in episodes that tell you which albums are syncing. Kid A can sync with every episode!
