A mention of Bollywood for anyone who has a modest knowledge of the genre and the images that are usually conjured up is cheap, over the top music numbers that are endowed with costumes that make Vegas seem to be a bastion of conservatism. This perception does not help the breath of condescension that penetrates most of the films that have come to Bollywood from outside. Willard Carroll is a romantic comedy Marigold, but has a different direction. It's not a dull blink of blinking glance at those stupid people and their clueless antics, but honest recognition of Bollywood for his vitality, his lack of irony and confidence. Obviously, the director has a great affection and respect for Bollywood, while at the same time being impressed with his cheesy aspects. And if you're familiar with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he's doing here by making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, memories of Salman's character as a kid at the seaside, talking to Grandma (played by Helen! - how many Salman's movies start with this same assumption?) To the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the film that Marigold and Prem filmed, each Who saw enough Bollywood movies will recognize these links. Does the story itself include the tried and true conventions of Hollywood and Bollywood? fish from water meets the obligation of the family - at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film builds on the typical Bollywood line of plot of the more comic set of the first half, which gives way to a more dramatic solution to the other. Ultimately, however, the film's sensibility of the Hollywood film, with its underrated humor and its story of how a woman learns to believe in herself, is to achieve her own confirmation. You couldn't have a Bollywood-inspired movie if there were no music numbers and this movie won't disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, songs do not look out of the blue and transport their characters to a European location or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film, which is made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as part of the scene show. Or will they come out of a situation where music has reason to be there? sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or beach scene where there are musicians (including a portrait from the singer Shaan) playing. They all reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at this point in the film. Music often takes a conventional song from one genre and puts it on the other side. So in one of the highlights of the movie, where Marigold comes into his own, is the song picturazation quite typical of his genre? a female star singing and dancing among a number of women? but in this case it is blond Ali Larter, who looks like a completely natural Bollywood movie star, emotional and synchronizing lips with Hindi lyrics without subtitles. thanks to some of the best talent working in Bollywood today. The cameraman is Anil Mehta, who was also a cameraman for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this movie? in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the figures was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which consistently has an embedded Marigold pattern. As far as the cast is concerned, Carroll is obviously keen on spotting the acting talent as shown by Playing by Heart ?? one of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this movie he will hit Ali Larter again. One of the main reasons why a movie works is bigger. She makes a scathing, unnatural character sympathetic and her subsequent transformations believable and she is smart, funny and sexy because she's smart and funny. She and Salman share great chemistry, and that's one of the greatest powers of film. Salman Khan plays Prince Charming, which is filtered by his iconic Prem role. It is the old school of Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar can be disappointed? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive performance from him, which is marked only by a misrepresentation of his English lines. With a refreshing lack of cynicism and a shameless embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter from Bollywood and Hollywood from ancient times.
