So it may not be completely accurate historically. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (Ridley's son) Scott's first try, it's well worth the ticket price. Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller looked as good as ever) could be a gentleman, but he got money or clothes to do it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes) is a pharmacist who turned to outlaws. The circumstances of their special encounter include dead body, ruby, and finally a partnership as a gentleman's highway. As the mark says, "they rob the rich ... and that's it." There is not really much background or development, but the goal is to rid the aristocracy of enough money and gems to pay for the passage of two highways to America. One small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With Chief Justice Chief Rebecca (Liv Tyler). Who happens to have also caught the eye of the thief Taker General. The action is pretty original, casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as drag-queen Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also together in "Trainspotting" have not lost their momentum), costumes are fantastic, make-up is Outrageous and music is a tough techno with a strangely classic undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good balance between show and conspiracy, and he's not capricious about showing the unpleasant side of the 17th century in London. And luck for us, he likes close-up faces, especially eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And Liv Tyler, too, but hey, what's the movie about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett and MaCleane. But there is more to this film than just pretty faces. With the risk of clich√©, it is a fast, furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the noblest builders since Robin Hood. Decadent, slim and violent, Scott's debut film is for a fun evening in movies. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was amazing, and it was a bloody good laugh!"
