After reading some earlier nasty notes, I had to give two cents. This show is NOT, in spite of what Goon thinks in Essex, the worst thing ever on television. I think most of today's televisions are much worse (when it's a stupid "reality" fad ever ends up?) And there's no current show that I could watch. Give me the things I grew up with. I am a child in 1965 and I am not ashamed to admit it. This show was my favorite favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when I originally aired it, and I think it helped me through the miserable days. At that time I was such a misfit and "Fantasy Island" appealed to my imagination. Since I was a novice writer at that time, it provided me with incredible opportunities to practice crafts. What a wonderful assumption! I'm not saying it has no mistakes. Sometimes the scripts were bad enough and some problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a great spell to watch and still is. As for the cheesiness factor, well, I think it is unfair to label a product as cheese every 70s. There were a lot of great things at the time. (BTW, most of the seasons broadcast in the 1980s!) My favorite episodes come from periods 2, 3 and 4 mostly. For those who disrespect Herv√© Villechaize for their heavy French accent and short stature. : GROWTH AND LEARN! It's so easy to make fun when you're "normal" and "perfect". The man did the best that was given to him in life, and if you don't like it, it's just hard. Have a little compassion. He's been dead for 15 years and how easy it is to reduce someone who can't defend himself. It's no shame anymore. <br /> <br /> I love this show. It looks like it's dated. I hate to tell you, but we didn't have splashy special effects and Blu-Ray discs. We were lucky to have video recorders. Live with him. Accept it for what it is and it's just fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me - escape from my spoiled real life. And it's still a lot of fun to watch.
