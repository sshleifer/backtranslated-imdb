If you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and good comedy entertainment, then this movie is highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer offers excellent performance here. <br /> <br /> The film also offers something you should think about next time a serious sub film asks for "quiet running" .... <br /> <br />
