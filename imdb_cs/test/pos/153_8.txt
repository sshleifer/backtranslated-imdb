Now that I saw it, it wasn't what I expected, at least not to the end. I read some of the other reviews before I took a used copy of Amazon and I was glad I did it. When I was first introduced in Park's work by Oldboy, I was curious about how he would treat the genre and be somewhat pleased with the clever way he did it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work have a very nice and deliberate work with the camera, he has a nice innovation in Bakjwi that I haven't seen in other vamp movies. For example, the scene where Father Hyeon realizes that the "beast" is growing in it, when he always gives his shoes to Tae-ju barefoot and is able to see the blood that passes through Tae-ju's skin and his eye is widespread in blood desire for it. That was a nice effect. I was also glad that Park did not make CG crap out of the movie and in fact there is little CG at all. I came away from Bakjwi, who was absolutely ready to think that one thing would happen and take a journey in a real fashion park. In addition, I liked that Park played with little symbolism and conversion, while we usually don't get to Asia. During the beginning of the film, we see the plot evolve and recognize the characters and feel like an invisible observer of what is happening. Park treats you like the spirit of the Christmas future that will show you, albeit a little boring, what life is out of your world. But then we begin to feel a little affinity for the fallen Father and his growing desire for Tae-ju and the conflict with the priest's duty. We almost start to take root for them until Park closes us into reality and we really see that Bakjwi is ultimately a film about a moral dilemma and the right and wrong. It won't spoil you if I tell you to look at Bakywi from the priest's point of view and think you will leave with what Park wants you to leave. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because it's not what you get here. Very interesting view of the genre. Those who missed many literary elements and religious hints followed some other film, not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi, Watching Let One Right, this is not also what you expect one.
