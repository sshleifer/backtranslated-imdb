An amazing comedy-drama about friendship abilities. Despite being a 1939 remake of the same title, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would compare it completely. The story starts with Mary (Meg Ryan), who seems to be the envy of most women, is happily married, has a good daughter, great friends and a great home. But Marys's perfect life is not what it seems to discover when her husband is cheating on her with Crystal (Eve Mendes) of Zach's. Mary is confused and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) are trying to be for her anyway. I really don't want to give away anymore. But I found it nice and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's nice to see her again on the screen, after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast are also great, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just a nice cheerful comedy.
