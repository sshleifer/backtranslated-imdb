This film is beautiful in every way. It's visually stunning, and that's a good thing, because the dialogue would only take one page or two papers. The effect is excellent; it is gentle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a great job of turning into an animal and mixing that wild nature with enthusiasm and human honor. There is no one mistake, no one mistake, no bad moment to be found anywhere. It's absolutely perfect, but only if you understand what you experience. It's not a movie for anyone who wants normality.
