Cecil B. DeMille conducted a series of home comedies-dramas in late teens and early 20s. His perfect leading lady found these provocative pieces in Gloria Swanson. In not changing her husband, Swanson plays a bored housekeeper whose wealthy businessman husband (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. She is haunted by a pretty roue (Lew Cody) until she apologizes and divorces a boring husband for a new lover. Things will soon get to know each other and Swanson will find that the new husband is just as insignificant first. To make matters worse, he finds out that Cody has a woman on her side (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and comfortable meetings, things were resolved. This was a hit in 1919 and helped make Gloria a Swanson star. Even though she was only 20 when she made it, she's very good as maybe a foolish woman. She looks great and wears some amazing clothes. There is one unforgettable scene that is 100% DeMille, in which Cody attracts Swanson with the promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As she gets along with her, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is the fantastic Swanson scene in the spider hammock swinging over the pool while people dance around. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is dressed as a Babylonian queen as servants bring her jewelry chests, which shes throws aside. Love is a scene in which there is a wooden nymph who loves a forest clearing with a figure similar to Pan (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum, but very fun, and Swanson looks great. Dexter is very good as a bland husband who shaves his mustache and starts working to get his wife back. Cody is also good as a fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Faye is funny because the other woman - named Toodles no less - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn married Ruth St. Denis and together they were pioneering and influential modern dancers (Denishawn schools). Swanson impressed me every time I saw her. It seems she was such a natural actress and yet there is a way for the camera to capture her distinctive face, which is simply fascinating. It's a pleasure to watch. Very fun movie with lots of color shades in different scenes to keep things alive. And a lot of furniture is back in style 86 years later.
