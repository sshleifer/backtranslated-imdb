This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with music, scenery and film reality are quite convincing. Let's look at the truth, say it is logging, a mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. The Horseflies music is very unique and gives some scenery a mysterious quality. After I first saw this movie, I had to go out and buy a video and a soundtrack. Overall, calm type of film with panic explosions. Both Torn and Cardinal are very believable in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People with another favorite, Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis.
