Slausen's lost oasis. . . place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After disappearing the guy on the way to the gas station, a group of her friends set off to find him. They come to the wax museum where they think their friend is over. Unfortunately for friends, the owner of the road attraction has the power to control his wax figurines and use them for evil. One by one, tourists are stalked down and killed Slausen and his legion of wax figures. Can friends escape or fall on the same fate as their lost friend? In the footsteps (and twisting around) of the great classic wax films, the Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style. As for character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic slasher movie. But he goes further than the director controls the plot and moves him to the supernatural thriller. Acting ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from the backwoods-showman Mr. Slausen (played by western-legend Chuck Connors)). Writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but some flaws appear in the logic because the film becomes deeper into the story. Also, some scenes are a bit silly, like a moaning-mannequin attack on Becky. It's nothing that reflects the effect of the film. As one would expect from a wax film, it is full of the endless scary of the dummy delivered. It's strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just sit and worry about it. . . maybe it's a human form, or a blank look, or the fact that you know he's going to attack. . . No matter what it is, dolls are very scary and this effect is used very well throughout the movie. As for slashes, it's one of the best and it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Obligatory Slasher Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The film is full of cold deaths. Gore is not exaggerated but it is good and leaves it as realistic. Sex / Nudity: There is a widespread scene with lean immersion with very attractive leading women (albeit very attractive) "Tanya Roberts is barely beginning to describe the future future angel, but he's just a tease because girls mostly stay under water. They remain modestly clad in the entire film, however. Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his dummy. One of the best killers in the slasher. Scares / Suspense: From the opening scene on which the film unfolds, the film retains a brilliant blend of the horror of the dummies, the frightened jumps of attacks, and the strong tension in the stranded situation. . . It's very well done to make a really scary movie. The Secret: Well, the secret wasn't really the meaning of the movie. . . just the meaning behind it all is what matters. Scary Dance Scene: All these cute girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. Check out this creepy slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
