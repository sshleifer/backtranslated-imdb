I enjoyed this movie and after you have finished, you still think about it. I believe that Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, though his "death" was a bit over the top, but I didn't mind his Jeremy Brett. This is a good piece of drama and does follow Oscar Wildes' novel very closely. If you like this movie, I also recommend watching "Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. This film gives a great look at Oscar Wildes' way of thinking. It is recalled how Dorian Gray is in a way Lord Alfred 'bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
