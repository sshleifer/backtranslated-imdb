I really love this movie !!! I didn't play Final Fantasy VII, but I still loved the movie, it's really funny and I like the work that the actors performed. The visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done. I have to admit, I have a pretty good imagination, so I was able to fill most of the movie gaps I introduced and suggest you watch it twice because a lot of "suddenly" makes sense. Also (that's pretty funny) you should watch it with headlines because of what they say and what the participants say are sometimes completely different. It's really usually pretty funny, but sometimes it helps u understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> Watch it !!! I love Marnie
