In New Orleans, it's a pretty nice bearable chapel, but in my opinion it's a major downfall that too many political intrigues and double crosses are wrapped up, not enough sexy young actors, vibrant color scenes, original cinematographic style and biting. humor. These aspects unite to provide a refreshingly courageous cinema that makes many recent things unbearably boring. Hopefully SÃ©bastian Gutierrez continues with such an atmosphere - he looks like a talent to be careful about. An incorrect bunch of small scammers in the film is overshadowed by Emma Thompson's and Alan Rickman's investigative partnership, whose humor is very important to making the film a thing of the matter. The pair push aside their mandatory South draws as well as the Yanks, and it is a pleasure to hear these two devout British cinematographers fade to each other with the Lethal-Weapon style ... just a pity that the only scenes they can steal are exclusively theirs. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!) Would the movie be almost perfect, so I'll give him a healthy 8/10 and hope that a few people will remember something better than the box office.
