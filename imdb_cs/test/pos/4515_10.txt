Kite Runner was beautiful, engaging and very mobile. I especially loved the two children's actors in the film, as well as the actor depicting the father. He really wanted to come back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the movie. If a soundtrack is released for a movie, I'll buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. It's also a visually stunning movie. Cinematography was beautiful and really added to the experience. The Brazilian word 'saudades' is very descriptive as I felt at the end of the film ... "it is a deep feeling of desire for someone or somewhere that is very sweet but also tinged with unbearable sadness" the definition that Antonio Carlos Jobim provided years ago.) I would like to see it again on a really big screen with a burned sound system. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the official release.
