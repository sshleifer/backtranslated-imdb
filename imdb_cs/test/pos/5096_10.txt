"Chips" is a brilliant blend of music, light comedy and drama with the perfect performance of Peter O 'Toole and effortlessly romantic accompaniment by Petul Clark. Toole is able to show a shy, non-communicative teacher who wishes so much to be loved by his students and is able to express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). It brings him the world of "What a lot of flowers" and he is changed forever. He becomes beloved director of Brookfield through tragedy but knows that he could only achieve his goal through the love of Katherine. Songs (except Music Hall) are all "thought songs" that come from the emotions and thoughts of the character, and the more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become - "Walk the World with Me" and "You and Me". O'Toole's best moment is the closing speech that gives students (that was the reason for being nominated for an Oscar). As a teacher, we ask what "learning" is going through - but as Chips says, we taught them how to treat themselves, and that's what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly arranged by John Williams and one of the most moving movies about love and how he can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" boys sing their school song. By the end, Chips will realize he was able to do it - but just cause Catherine to be there.
