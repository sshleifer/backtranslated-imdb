This little film resembles several other films, but it can keep its own style and mood. "Troll" and "Don't Be Straight of the Dark" come to mind. Tension builders were good, and just across the line from G to PG. I especially liked the non-classical elections with my parents; In other movies, I could predict the verbatim dialogue, but writing in this movie made a better choice. If you want a movie that is not rude but gives you some chills, it's a great choice.
