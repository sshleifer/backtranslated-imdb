Dead Gentlemen Productions produced a film with amazing production values ​​for their budget. Anyone who has ever played a role-playing game, especially any fantasy RPG (playing Dungeons and Dragons), will love this movie. Brilliant performances all around - especially with regard to the dual nature of the principles, playing their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever made or acted in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they have put into the project. This film (and its prequel) is for fantasy films and role-playing games what Blazing Saddles is to Westerns - a high order parody. I have only a few minor complaints about the movie myself, none of them will prevent me from buying DVDs as soon as they are available (only 6 weeks - counting days): 1. When Lodge talks to Joanna about joining the game a group, give her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook, and say, "This will tell you everything you need to know." The camera floats too long for the book, and it looked like a commercial. 2. Jokes are cheerful but seem unevenly spread throughout the movie. The last third of the film, after an almost continuous overcrowding of visual and verbal humor in front of it, slows down a bit, as if the story caught up with jokes. Odd, but Blazing Saddles always hit me so badly. . . and I love the movie too. One of the narrative powers of the story is the unsolved character of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna Become a GM Girlfriend? Will he come back to Cass? Or do the three retain a platonic friendship, deepened by the role play? (Yes, it sounds smiling, but there are a few saccharin moments, especially when Cass and Lodge "make up" at the end.) But the film lasts for one week: in terms of human relations, these questions could not be answered. week. The fact that relationships between characters remain undefined will hit me better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, like a girl gets her prince and moves to a castle, or a prince dives into the North Atlantic after three banal, boring and predictable hours. It seems that writers have an understanding of the character psychology, and you can see the characters (both players and player figures) that change during the movie, but not suddenly, and not incredibly. I'd like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man in the dark is ... fluorescent."
