I cant see how some people cant find this movie funny I've seen the end of it on Sky Movies in 2001 thought it would be on DVD since I laughed my balls with lines like Rik Mayalls laughing "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies "Hi Night Porter "If you never get any phone calls, I think this movie is very funny."
