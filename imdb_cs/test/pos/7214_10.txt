I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said that the best films include either the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies. This movie is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Julie are pleased to watch from start to finish. Zany's zeal that supports this Shakespeare shenanigan is contagious. I don't think I laughed so much because I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It is alright like this!
