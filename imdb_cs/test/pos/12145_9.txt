Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I watch a film by Jean-Pierre Melville, which I had to watch him as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and seemingly worked in his filmography, it would be easy for me to consider it one of his films, but was made in 1960 by Claude Sautet before Melville arrived and claimed his claim . French neo-noir. Classe Tous Risques has two of the top leaders, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two children who want to return to Paris because the police are closing on him. After a swift and quick opening, with great surprise, Abel finally joins Eric Stark (Belmondo), who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventually the only friend in the underworld to turn back to Abel after all he has done and gone through. The film shows the duality of the two men, Elder Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy, and the younger Erik, who begins as Abel, fell in love with a beautiful woman who keeps her husband despite being part of the world. They never end pretty or their loved ones for them. His only thing to see an individual criminal comes to his demise, his different when he has a loved one who runs the risk of coming down with him. Like Melville's film, a seemingly simple story becomes somewhat more complicated. it goes on. As usual, like what I feel at Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good sense) and dying to watch it again to take what I missed for the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a unique goalie.
