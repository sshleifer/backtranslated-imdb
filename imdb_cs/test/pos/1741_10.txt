I loved this show. Such talent; And I am so disappointed that it is canceled only after I started. I was looking forward to this show all week. So I apologize to the people who hoped to be The One. I'd like to see who would win. It just started and in my opinion it should not be lifted. I hope these young artists have been seen by talent scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat and waited for it to come; she never knew she was canceled. And I couldn't believe it was. I'm impressed that he had a low rating; because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on TV.
