This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities to the Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are some other very similar action movies, but this movie has a much better action than Death An order or even an island of fire (that's true, Jackie Chan's film). Rarely American action movies have such great action sequences, although there were many negative reviews on this movie, easily outperforming most of the action movies of that time that were more successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was quick as Bruce Lee in this movie and what else was good that the fighting scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts movies. The footage of the filming was similar to John Woo's films, maybe not as good but still very abandoned. There were also many impressive blasts and one big chase scene. I've seen some other films by David Bradley, but this is the best in action. OK, this movie has some kitsy moments, but which movie does it have? Acting was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was really tough. Adam Clark, who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main bad was also very good. The other actors also performed quite well, though this is not important in this type of movie. If you're a fan of action movies (I mean a real action movie fan who really appreciates good action), you need to see this movie.
