"I was struggling with death. It's the most unrivaled contest you can imagine. It happens in a messy grayness, with nothing under your feet, with nothing around, no spectators, no horror, no glory, no great desire for victory, no great fear of defeat, in a sick atmosphere of lukewarm skepticism, without much faith in your own right, and even less than your adversary. If there is such a form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a bigger puzzle than some of us think it is. " Joseph Conrad's Marlow in "The Heart of Darkness" It is difficult to make a lyrical subject of death in every work of art, but films have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is accepted as part of a cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislative. "Chosen" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar's sea within, loosely based on the true story of Galician It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudices dressed in love, poetry and friendship, if it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancer professor says he says goodbye to lifelong friends and loves to take his life. then you are right. In fact, the sea is better because it spends more time with the protagonist than it is, which is a remarkable performance that has neither of those moments in the least boring or uninteresting. Javier Bardem as Ramon has distinctive eyes and a commanding voice for a romantic quadriplegic, a combination of harsh realism and poetic suffering. Belen Rueda plays the disabled lawyer Julie, who becomes an imaginary lover for Ramon, and his glow increases as her life degenerates with disease. Added to the already almost soap opera circumstance is Lola Duenas as Rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially attempts to repel Ramon from searching for death but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romanticizing disability? This guy has an incredible happiness that attracts substantial women, and can't move his finger. But he can talk, which proves the ultimate argument about what women want: a love that speaks, not just does. I'm not going to mention that the main movie is now for the Oscar, which is its culmination. not to damage the experience for the first timers. It is enough to say that both films are successful in opening both sides of the issue in question without forcing a particular point of view. Religious law has the right to complain that the former film and Barbarian invasions celebrate suicide; he has no right to blame the beautifully balanced Sea within the same. "Life in this state has no dignity," says Ramon. The irony is that it is conducted with the highest dignity that challenges anyone's determination to end their lives. "The Sea Inside" is an impressive entry in the 2004 Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.
