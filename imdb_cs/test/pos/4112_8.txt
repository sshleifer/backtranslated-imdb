At that time I was 19 or 20 years old and lived in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new dome theater, called the 21st Century. screen and packaged theater. We felt excited about the new movie preview. I can still hear the opening music ringing the trumpet and the cymbal crash. I loved the interplay of the characters and the shooting views. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some sink problems, but hey, this was a good feeling, go feel better about movies! I'm sorry to cut the meaningful heart out of it, show the version, and then call it a flop. I saw the version of the cut and I see that he lost sight of the vision he had in the preview. Yes, I will do a bit to make Peter try to love through music, but you know I didn't see it when I left the theater. when they examined us when we left, I regret any comments I made and which could change the original. I liked it and I still see it when I listen to music on my LP. Most of my family have heard me sing a lot of sound and I can use movies of monologues in our "what is film" games. I wish the director's cut on DVD was available. It's available on VHS, but it's not the same. Especially I would like to give my full attention to the comments about his beginnings, matches and triumphs. Disgusting people should leave things well enough. Bring it back !!!!
