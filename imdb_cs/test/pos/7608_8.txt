Of course, really experienced reviewers who like things like Star Wars and professional crap will definitely drag this movie and say really bad comments about it. But indeed, it is a fun teen comedy with an amazing story and good acting performance. ') Jobs - They have to go back to school and find out what the teens are these days. Well, that's fine until Josie remembers her horrible high school time and falls out. But she has never been a hip, has never been cool, has never been popular today! Sit down and enjoy Never breastfed!
