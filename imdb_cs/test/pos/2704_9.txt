Watching this movie, I was amazed at how the perception of the media could shape the opinion of celebrities. Karen Carpenter was a carefree but unwavering young lady whose amazing voice helped her and her brother Richard hovered with beautiful songs. As with all today's personalities, they were often criticized for their music, as well as for their appearance, style, etc. This had a huge impact on Karen, who raged against her food and lost weight drastically, eventually causing her death. This felt-heart movie wasn't something I thought I'd watch. But when I started to see it, I was addicted. Just like Tina Turner's story, this film enlightens you and gives you insight into the lives of young artists. Acting was excellent, and even almost 20 years after its production, then direction and dialogue are still fun. <br /> <br /> I'd like to recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. It's amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.
