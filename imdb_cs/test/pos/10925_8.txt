I just saw the movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two brothers who have fallen in love, and I think it's a good idea, especially for those looking at it. I loved the short film genre after seeing a couple because they must impress you so quickly, and I must say that this is definitely a mark. They've described some of the things I've never thought about like this, incest to one. I must admit that I didn't care much about the end. Only once would I want to watch a gay movie without wanting to kill myself in the wards. It almost always ends in tragedy. It was "cute" how they had to be together, even though it was in death. The inner view of the world that this movie allows you to enter. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening, joy.
