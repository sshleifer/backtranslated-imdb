Countless TV displays and an unforgettable performance from 4 today's megapixels (plus Hope Davis debut) keep the Flatliners cautious. The story is about the non-academic research of five medical undergrads who are watching the crazy idea of ​​discovering the secret of death and learning what is after death and then returning to life. But the story was not designed as fascinating as the conspiracy idea. There are popular stereotypes to create a regular teen-slasher script in Flatliners. There's Nelson, who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, nice, but introverted, Rachel, David, who fortunately cuts the Gordian knot out of school, ladies Joe and finally clever boy Randy ("I didn't come to school to murder my classmates without No matter how they might behave. ”They combine together in an experiment where Nelson's heart is stopped and rerythmed, then decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night on the campus. a race that has the wildest and longest experience of death, risking their lives one by one, but they soon realize that their everyday life is influenced by the experiences they have had, the afterlife visits bring back their delicate feelings of childhood memories. their deep subconscious alertness, they begin to have somatic delusions and vi When it comes to the point where an explanation of the subconscious, director Joel Schumacher skips that every humanity has a subconscious person who he is not aware of. . This inner personality keeps one from turning into a loss of identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious person, you will lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add it as a film mistake that has already been mentioned by film critics in the 1990s. Obviously, in this movie Schumacher made the actors the least affected. So why are they hesitant to continue the experiment after learning their lesson as if death were designed by God who is undetectable? David was introduced as an atheist, now it turns out to believe in God when he remembered his childhood memory. Having witnessed this 180 dissenting change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was so conservative and lily-livery; that is why it is never classified as a science fiction work. Alas! She had good potential. She even tried to tell the unconscious maturation that she had experience of death and began to believe that death was so natural and it was only part of human life. More than what's in the movie, it was also unforgettable to recall what's with the movie. Jan de Bont, as a cameraman who has worked with Schumacher almost every time, creates a dreamlike atmosphere as if it were a Gothic horror movie. The blue color schemes on the walls reflecting the actors' faces bring the first class of lighting that perfectly matches the film. Close-up shots of gargoyle sculptures in campus buildings, Catholic frescoes in walls, stop-motion cameras and dynamic camera speeds were Bont's skills. Flatliners has become a cult film over time with its sociological pen-portrait of X-generation teenagers, especially through a futuristic editing style with a sequence of script connection, as part of the video clip aesthetically pleasing. These were times when fast-paced video clips and multiple sequences grew. This style was very rare to come across in those years after its pioneer Tony Scott's "Hunger (1983)".
