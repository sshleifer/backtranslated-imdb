I remember watching this film in 1981 when I was 7. It was absolutely great! I found a DVD a few months ago. I almost jumped up and down with joy !! I bought it and showed it to my children. They loved it too. They asked what words the sea horse sings (I didn't tell them because I don't think saying "gay" and "ecstasy" to 6-year-olds is a very good education). Songs are brilliant. I still remember them. I'll still remember them when I'm 60! There or near. Tommy Pender is (was) such a great actor. It's a shame he gave up. <br /> <br /> If you find a movie, BUY! You'll love it!
