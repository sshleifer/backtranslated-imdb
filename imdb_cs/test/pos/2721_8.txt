After Mrs and Mr Iyer, this is another very good movie, Aparny Dream (mostly in English). In an earlier film, she dealt with the current political environment and its effect on the individual. In this film, it is the impact of a mentally disabled family member and its impact on the family. As a parallel subtopic, he understands the philosophical concept of "reality." It's a movie that leads to thinking after watching a movie. Mithee's younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, daughter of Aparna Sen) suffers from Schizophrenia, which is dominated by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). After his marriage to Jojo and separation from him, Mithee believes that he is still with JOJO and five children on 15 avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta - it seems to be one in New York) and intense in his faith. It's almost like an intense religious belief. Finally, what is reality? In one scene, Anjali says "if you tell me you're not a professor, but just imagine you're a professor". The open end reflects this reality. In allegedly looking for her home in avenue park, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is Mithee looking at a group of five children playing and looking at them with pleasure from returning to their family and then being lost. This concept of reality reminds me of another film of the 1950s called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that the great rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him and he always talks to him. Finally, the doctor believes he is perhaps Harry. What is reality is what the protagonist believes or what others believe Shabhna Azmi controls the film with its performance as a strong elder sister with a frustration undercurrent. Konkana Sen Sharma gives the same performance as schizophrenic. Yet the film is not as tight as Mrs and Mr Iyer. There seem to be some free ends. And maybe there are too many of them. Those who want to have a closed end may not appreciate the open end. But the end fits the movie theme. One more good Aparana Dream movie.
