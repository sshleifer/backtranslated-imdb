Brilliant Chuck Jones, master of comedy Warner Bros., brings us the first (?) Pepe LePew cartoon. An alien cat, tired of being pushed around, painted in skunk colors and with a healthy dose of Limburger, turning tables to his torturers. Then comes Pepe, and you know the rest.

This 1947 toon is one of the few examples of Mel Blanca who put a totally crazy voice in Pepe's mouth. But the kicker is the end where Pepe is revealed as an American "wolf in a skunk suit"! You must see! Classic Warner Bros ...
