War at home is a great TV series and I don't understand it because it was canceled. Please, fairies something that will continue with this beautiful TV series, with excellent and amazing actors, good recitation and good situations, please, we want a third series and even many new episodes. I pray you !!!! If possible, I would like to do this and send a forehand to those interested, because I can tell you that here in Italy this series is very popular, as in other European countries a dresser such as Spain. In the effects I wrote about what the strike of this TV series is, it is a good reciting of actors and also honest with many things of real significance. I think both of the best American TV series will arrive on Italian screens in recent years.
