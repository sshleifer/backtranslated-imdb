This move is certainly one of the greatest films of his or of another genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be inserted into a time capsule and never forgotten. 2001: The Space Odyssey is a way apart from everything I've ever seen on screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can draw you and keep you from start to finish, even in the absence of widespread dialogue or conspiracy development. Only with visual imagery, 2001 is able to present an image of the future that is amazing and scary. 10 out of 10, no doubt. It's not much better for my money than in 2001: Space Oddysey .... now, sequel, 2010 ... that's another story.
