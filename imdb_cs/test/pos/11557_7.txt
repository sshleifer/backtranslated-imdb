Sometimes I really care? when I look at the comments, it seems as though most people saw a completely different film than me. I saw it ... and I liked it. It's not that it made me happy, but in the way I saw a good movie! The film needs patience, yes. And yes, the main character is really annoying, but I'm sure it's the intention. Maybe it's really a difference if you watch this movie in the movies or at home. Most people watch movies at home, as if listening to elevator music. This movie doesn't fit in the background. <br /> <br /> And no. Good direction doesn't mean you have five laughs or blasts per second. Good direction means watching your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And although it doesn't work perfectly, at least I think it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> I liked taking pictures and sets, though sometimes they got on surreal outlines. The opening scene is really special. Also I liked acting? Guillaume Depardieu is not playing Pierre. He works as Pierre, who plays a role! Pierre is not a romantic hero who is so hard to be, he is a pretentious and confident idiot, a downright weak man who damages all the people he claims to protect. That even his love of truth is simply a position, he is beautifully demonstrated by his continued lying, not once asking questions or explaining himself. People are wondering where that person came from and other things: Not a character that is seen for more than two scenes is left inexplicable, there is enough information available throughout the movie. And even a strange building starts to make sense as soon as the goal of the exercise is seen: Remember that Isabelle has fled the war zone - and this is apparently a refuge for civil war fighters, most likely Bosnia ( still doing when the movie was made). At least it is described by Isabelle's story tells Pierre when she first meets him and later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle's book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books about Bosnia.
