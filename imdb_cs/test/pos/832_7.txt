This film is good in its genre and this genre is naturally a small / average budget event. It looks like Van Damme brings a lot better performance when a good director leads him. There is your basic bar battle, alley scene and mostly a lot of fighting weapons. Some basic drama but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs the action OK if you ignore the weak graph and holes in it. But the one who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. How come this guy is not a massive star of action Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine and Scott Adkins made a film called Special Forces (2003), which has an incredible talent for martial arts that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu. Another amazing feature of Scott Adkins is undisputed 2. Look at this guy and make a noise, this guy has to get a super action star status and needs to get it right now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about the movie? It's Van Damme, who has accelerated some of his recent work. There aren't any Oscars here, but you already knew. But never less has a nice little town and I could find worse ways to spend time. So I give it a solid 7 out of 10 in his genre.
