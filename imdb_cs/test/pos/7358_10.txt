It doesn't have to have big budgets, celebrities or Scream, Urban Legend or I Know Last You Last Summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing these three movies were missing: a real horror movie. This film, one year before it was aptly named and less than the enchanting Urban Legend, dealt with the theme of urban legends. It was interesting, masterfully written and logical as I knew what you last did. Finally he concentrated and finished with a whiff while Scream went out and died. What is most exciting about the film is the horror that writers and directors have achieved. The overlapping story of teenagers around the campfire was a classic fear of the unknown (but certainly expected) fate that was waiting for them in the woods, but the stories themselves are where the film really shone. a clean, rapidly changing urban myth. Based on popular legend, the director plays the style and pace of action, making it more fascinating because we know what will happen. The first camp story is a straight forward thriller. In fact, based on another popular myth, we do not realize this until the end, both because it is so well mixed into the story and because the action keeps our attention. Being a thriller of trilogy, this one will play our fear of the unknown and include several well-executed "jump" sequences that don't feel almost as cheap or dirty as in movies like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more exciting. This time, even though the characters still do not know what is going on, we do, and that provides horror. No need for cheap excitement here. The final story contains supernatural elements and uses a spooky / triple atmosphere to frighten the viewer. Because we can so easily stand up to the characters and their situation, our fear is based on their intensity and what they can't explain. This is the true spirit of the trio. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect to be enjoying Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought if I didn't like his more recognized, larger budget counterparts, how would I like it? The truth is, this film succeeded where others fell far from the mark.
