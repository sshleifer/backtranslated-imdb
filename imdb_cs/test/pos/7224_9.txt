Tromeo and Juliet are perhaps the best Shakespeare upgrades I've ever seen, not that there's a lot of competition, but still ... with a pile of manure. It's a funny, action-packed, gorean story about the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as faithfully as possible, except for this kind of film. Well, to the end, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Julie's offensive father and live together happily in sunny suburban areas for the rest of their lives with their terribly mutated children. This is a school classroom class instead of showing poor students to read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
