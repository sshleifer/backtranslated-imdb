Bergman and comedy don't come together. Some of his comedies are so bloated. This movie has a special naff moment - the last 30 seconds is nadir, but on the whole it's a charming (rather than funny) piece, pleasant throughout. Bergman casts some of his usual suspects who are performing well. It is a great scene on the train between David, Marianne and an unofficial salesman who will keep in mind. Some of the marriage material is typical, cynical Bergman, but it is Bergman in light rather than dark mood. This movie has its moments and is worth 90-odd minutes. Not one of his classics, not a place to start if you want to fall on Bergman.
