I have enough free tickets through The Times to see this Irish Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing' ... I didn't know anything about it, so I had no prejudices before I went inside. The film is about two guys who are confined to wheelchairs and live in the house. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Pals and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse spelling mistakes!). They form a bond because Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying. They eventually leave home to live in an apartment in Carrigmore itself. They immediately use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to take care of them. In the end, both friends fall in love with the same woman. This is a story in a nutshell, but there is a lot of laughter and tears along the way ... in fact ... being unprepared as I was .. I found that tears flowed too often! Actually! I don't think I've watched the Elephant Man movie so much !!! This movie is a great deal of emotion ... in both fun and sad things. Playing is absolutely in place! James McAvoy is my size tip ... he's a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also great ... and to this day, I found out that he didn't suffer from Cerabal Pals and it was just a few great games! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie, and plays the role of home manager very well. The second big part has to be Romola Garai, she was amazing as a love interest and I think we'll see more on the big screen in the near future! The thing that makes this film work is not just a synergy between the two leaders, but a scenario ... which is just as funny as it is literally on fire! I still can't help repeating some lines in my head now. The photo is good, though very bleak, but then captures a certain type of region of Ireland. The music is great in this movie as well as the choice in songs ... use of Johnny Cash cover from Nine Inch Nails track 'Hurt' is inspired !! If I had to summarize this film in one word ... it would be "emotional." This movie is very funny ... and then at the turn of the coin it's very sad! I still can't believe that two days after I saw the movie, I look at him laughing and crying! This movie is amazing ... and I hope it goes far! Although I don't see his advertising budget probably very small! <br /> <br /> Take a look! I urge you ... you will not regret ...
