I love B-horror movies. However, I'm generally not a big fan of "so stupid it's funny" movies. I rated HAD so easily because Death Bed: the bed that eats is so of its kind and so original. There are lots of question marks, lots of hole holes, and the WTF factor is wrapped up to 11, but I really wasn't bored for a second. I really couldn't say it's scary at any moment, every minute I thought, "what the hell is that bed / movie going on!" I watched it with a friend who was by no means a fan of horror movies or B-movies, and she was pretty good at it. the effects were really very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. It keeps a very consistent and even tone in most of the movie (though incredibly ridiculous consistency) and acting wasn't TERRIBLE. I see from the point that there are some inconsistencies in bed activities that make the suspension of faith almost damn impossible, but the film itself was so unique and bizarre that it didn't bother me. Seriously, for me, this movie hit that empire one I will never forget but also a guarantee that I will find myself thinking back to certain scenes in the future. Does anyone else know about other films in inanimate objects that eat the genre of people? absolutely fantastic.
