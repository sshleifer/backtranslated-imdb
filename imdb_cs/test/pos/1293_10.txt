I saw this episode of the Master Theater and immediately came to the IMDb to find out. I was greeted by a comment from another user who believed it was nothing special, 6 out of 10 and imperfect. If I disagree, I would feel morally impatient. Now I am a passionate fan of the Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories on TV can be a little silly, for example: It was right, it was absolutely terrible. "Carrie's War," is probably the best I've ever seen. The whole cast has a great job, and it caught me more than any other piece I saw recently. Mr Evans's character is particularly interesting, and with his fine images, such as the untouched birthday cake or garnet ring, my opinion of him has been from bad to really good. Really. His ultimate demise and the story of how everyone around him left him a cool, hard man is what has given me a bitter taste in this story. The end is pleasing in every sense, but one; that everyone didn't get what he deserved, but overall it turned out. I recommend it to everyone.
