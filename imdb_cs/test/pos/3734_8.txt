Look, you don't see this movie to change your life! But if you are a woman separately and have always had a little bit for Richard Gere; This movie is right on the street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere are back on the chemistry screen. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar-winning movie and will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later, but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully-shot love story between MIDDLE AGEDs good people (don't stomach and even when Gere is "up" that doesn't look too sharp) ), then it's a movie for you. I loved the story and it was important in many ways. Of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way, overlooked and not really dealt with ... I think I'd like to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that big love can change you for the better; Whether it is a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is love and its mysterious ways. I was a little surprised that James Franco took such a small part in this film, but it is always good for a few minutes of the screen. I really liked this movie because it was moving and sweet.
