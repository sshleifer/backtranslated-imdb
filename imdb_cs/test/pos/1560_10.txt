This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It represented culture in a true godless manner. They must see all who love India and those who do not. I think this film will be more drawn into the Indian scene. Acting was first! Alice's character was so well portrayed. With perfect avidity. This movie should be brought into the mainstream! I think it would be phenomenal! ALICE is the most real look at the element of our culture that I have seen from GO ASK ALICE. A look that is untouched by Hollywood hands. Such films show young people that these things are not charming, but that they are real and convincing. If you liked PIECES OF APRIL, you will love this!
