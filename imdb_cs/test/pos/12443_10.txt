From the golden era of British films, this is my voice for one of the funniest of all time. Yesterday I screened in my film club to share the audience, and I was amazed at how well the comedy lasted (1950!). It's really on the professional timing and inimitable playing of the two best actors that Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from John Dighton's play, this farce is sharply processed by director Frank Launder. The storyline is simple: The Ministry's error shows a girls 'school at a boys' school. I'll always laugh when I think of this movie.
