Brett Piper will once again make a very good film, which is destroyed by so-called "film experts". This is a low budget but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irena Joseph. Good entertainment. I bought a DVD and enjoyed it. Special effects are motion stop animations and much better than computer-generated crap that they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you like it, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he did. I look forward to seeing more of his work and more Mrs. Joseph. I don't understand why the woman wasn't in more movies because her performances are excellent.
