The astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds itself on the road through an unknown territory aboard a living spacecraft accompanied by a group of extraterrestrial outlaws. This incredible cartoon and pleasing television installment comes as a positive fantasy. Individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn with each other and eventually evolve into a powerful group. Most of the action takes place inside the womb of Moia, a living spacecraft (which even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasy (looking at 'Alien-films for example, especially the fourth part of' Resurrection ') this comes as a surprise. The absence of a military hierarchy aboard the ship and a positive attitude towards sex and the human (and extraterrestrial) body are also pleasing. One of the female characters who is actually a plant is experiencing "photogas" while exposed to sunlight. The crew even has to go to the bathroom. Wouldn't it be possible in Star Trek?
