Crackerjack is a simple but sensitive movie where good guys are very good and bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides. The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central setting of the local club baskets of clubs drew an unusually wide crowd ranging from large numbers of teens to large numbers of seniors - and all laughed at comedy. As expected from the movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was quite a lot of curses, but it wasn't an exaggeration and the audience was sitting with surely enjoyed it! Mick Malloy has done a good job as a lazy guy who has joined the bowls club (three times) to simply get parking spaces (one for himself and two for leasing to others for the premium), but who has everything to fall on him when he is required to play or lose his membership. Judith Lucy does a great job as his local journalist / love-interest, and there are great performances by Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many more. Dolar's role of John Clark as a bad guy isn't his fun, but he gives a solid performance. <br /> <br /> Not so subtle subtitles on pokies provide a little serious comment on this otherwise light comedy. I'm sure those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish could also enjoy this movie.
