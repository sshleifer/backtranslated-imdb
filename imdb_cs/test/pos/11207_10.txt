For those who are like me and are accustomed to watching and enjoying high budget movies on huge screens with surround sound, this film seems so remote. I was surprised, however, how close it could be to every person watching him. It is so natural that you feel like no one has written the script, or no one has. You are a director and you write the script when you watch it. The time I spend watching the movie is the only time I go to another world. This film is the first show for me that shows that it is not always necessary to watch millions of dollars of budgeted movies, spatial sound skills go to another world. These movies send you to another world (or maybe return you to yourself) without a million dollars budget or technical options. I felt like reading L'etranger from Camus.
