The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, he naturally becomes the musical of Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim consequences of poverty in the industrial revolution and the break-up of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, a composer who can adapt to any style. Sure, he had his achievements and failures, but one thing about his shows can always be: They will be unique. Who would have thought someone would write a barber musical that cuts people's throats and makes them meat pies? Sondheim did it and did it amazingly. The show takes place in a factory to indicate the ever-present catastrophic consequences of the suffering of those who are at the bottom of the show, perfectly suited to the needs of the show. Footbridges and railings move around the city and design streets and sidewalks and bridges. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual stagehands and set changes. Then, to overcome this, he cast a great Angel Lansbury as a very practical and witty Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn with his operatic baritone voice, like the murderous Todd, and you became a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves smoothly through the love story cliché, with the exception of Johann and Pirelli, who sound a little too much. If Johanna and Pirelli could be from the Broadway show, it would be perfect. Hearn acts while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents don't sound like forced. Throughout all this, Sondheim's score can never underline the darkness of the story. As I said, he can adapt to any style. In the Follies he imitates the '30s' 40s style showtunes, in the Pacific Overture he captures the fine art of Asian music, into the forests collide 32 bars of Disney song style and Assassins cover the history of American music. Here, however, he does wonders in making his score distinctly English, from saloon songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to waltz society to Gilbert / Sullivan style patter. And yet, the show remains deadly serious, though it provokes more laughter than any musical comedy. There is still a grim warning of evil revenge. Here's where this movie makes a mistake, cutting a judge's solo in which the whip gets rid of its crimes. Without her, the judge is just a conventional villain, and this movie is the point is that there are no direct villains. As Todd and the judge learn late, they must accept responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is well evoked from the freezing reprise of the grim but still moving Ballad of Sweeney Todd, ending the show with Todd and Lovett coming out of the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, only slander revenge. “Take part in the story of Sweeney Todd. He served the dark and vengeful God. Trying to get revenge can lead to hell, but they all do it, and rarely like Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, Demon Barber Street Fleet Street. ”\ T
