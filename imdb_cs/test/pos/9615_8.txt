The skeleton of the story is that the main character must win a public high-stakes kung fu tournament. The body of the story consists of LOTs of struggle, a love triangle, betrayal, rivalry and revenge. There's a lot to this story. The main character is very sympathetic as a balanced, slightly educated and very hard country boy. The good versus the bad movie is just as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and clever, not to mention ugly, insidious and complex. If there is one weakness, it is the scene where the main character's fianc√© imagines her and the protagonist runs together in the flower field and hugs each other when they meet. I thought I was looking at The Sound of Music for the second time, and I almost lost the hope of a movie. Fortunately, the film quickly recovered from the battle scene.
