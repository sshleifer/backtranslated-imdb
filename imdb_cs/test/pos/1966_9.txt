The river's edge is not a PLEASANT movie to watch, but it's incredible. When I looked at it many years ago, I think it would still have the ability to shock if it was reissued or reworked or something. Maybe no movie ever made has caught the nature of a young suburban inertia like this disturbing scary movie. As it is a real story, it is even more worrying. He behaved very well and UNPLEASANT had many times seen, but also a little known masterpiece and a really important film. It should be mandatory to view the nationwide display in all high schools. Fantastic.
