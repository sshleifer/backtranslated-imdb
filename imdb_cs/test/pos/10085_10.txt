This is one of the best movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so full of detail and every time you see it, you'll find new things ... but it just hears one voice and when the girls flute, they can't do it at the same time, then there would be two girls, and they're not there. <br /> <br /> I have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their "uncle" visit them, but why does his wife go crazy?!? Otherwise a fantastic movie. !!! Best Asian movie ever. <br /> <br /> I hope people will enjoy it. There were so many movies where the main character is skit-so (Machinist, Secret Window and so on), but this movie is much better than they !!!
