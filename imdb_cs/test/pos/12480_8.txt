Henri-Georges Clouzot is a silent example of the French cinema transition. A film between the realism of the post-war cinema and full of magic and symbolism of the hazy. With some spots of American classical films (but not imitation), the director tells the story of love, crime, and the importance of viewpoints. We can also find great actors (Suzy Delair is perfect). It is also interesting how we can find aspects of this film today. The heritage of the Quai des Orf√®vres is tangible in Woody Allen's tradition. Violation of the crime situation in a picturesque setting. The naive ending is also typical of Steven Spielberg's good films. Finally, I would like to point out that during the photo shoot of Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dory Monier (Simone Renant), in which the first one admits that her husband is unfaithful and precisely with a woman, it seems to be raining voo. who takes pictures. That scene is exactly that scene between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
