I saw it at a test show in Chatsworth a week ago and I went with a bunch of my friends. we all really loved it. James Franco is amazing and so hot, I would see it just for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also really good and plays an elite girl who is so in love with him that she can't let go. David Caradine, who was at Kill Bill, plays a cowboy and is ideal for that. The story is a bit strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magical things, you will love it !!! It is really original and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but in the end it will be more serious and we all ended up crying. I'll see it again with my friends, once it works out, it's really good !!!!!!!
