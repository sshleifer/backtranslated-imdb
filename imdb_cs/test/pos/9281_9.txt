I agree with GarryJohal of Singapore about this movie. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singapore does not see what is a big deal about this movie. Some of the links in this movie fly directly above the head of foreign viewers, and most of them are Singaporean, who would actually "get" it. It's still not true, and like Malaysian-Chinese, I 'get it' even if I don't speak Hokkien because we have similar 'problems' in Malaysia too. I know it's hard to understand and accept as REALITY, but it's definitely not "no real story." I was glad to see this movie outside Malaysia because it will be and will be banned in Malaysia. Which means you get it in "illegal copies of VCDs or DVDs" or you hope someone will be kind enough to "share" it on the Internet. This is not another violent teen drama ....... 'because it shows the reality that exists in Singapore (and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). I was just a little sad when I knew this film had about 20 censorship cuts. What a shame!
