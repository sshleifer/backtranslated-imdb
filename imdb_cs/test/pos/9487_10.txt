This set of two discs is incredible! If you're just like me and you've never really seen the band, it's the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who, in my opinion, is the second best guitarist ever to go out on the ground (the second only to Slowfingers himself), in every movie in this film shows an amazing show. John Paul Jones, though not as the front as a party, puts on one hell show. Although in a vibrant atmosphere, its rhythmic bass lines are not as defined as they are on studio recordings, except of course in songs like Dazed and Confused, or what is and what should be never), but its wide array of talent talent is well portrayed on these DVDs. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, his strikes stand out as no other, and this DVD is proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant laments like no other can lament. If you've ever read Hammer of Gods, you'll think about the same thing as Page when he first met Robert Plan, why the hell isn't this famous anymore? So concludes my assessment, sorry for spelling or grammatical mistakes, Zeppelin Rocks.
