This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite that I try to catch every year on TV. It revolves around Martha Stewart as a journalist named Elizabeth Lane, gracefully portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, unlike Martha, this lady is fake without home skills at all. Other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married housewife with children. In fact, she is a single woman living in an apartment in New York and can't cook eggs. Her recipes were borrowed by her Hungarian friend Felix. Elizabeth gets rid of her scam until her magazine's publisher, Alexander Yardley, decides she wants a nice old Christmas Christmas, and invites her to bring the returning war hero Jefferson Jones, a sailor who has failed. . Yardley demands the full honesty of his staff. To get out of her trouble and save her scam-based career, Elizabeth borrows Connecticut's country home of her longtime suitor architect, John Sloan, a boring, cunning guy who has long sought marriage. She also lends a neighbor's child (actually, several) to dismiss as her own and her 'husband' Sloan's. Of course, he does this scenario for a lot of fun. This is a screwdriver comedy and charming romance with added Christmas atmosphere. Every time I think this movie, I picture falling snowflakes, a tree beautifully decorated, a fire roaring in the fireplace, baking turkeys, and Christmas cookies baking. Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand that in 1992 he is directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and plays Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I didn't even see this modern adaptation. This old favorite is perfect just as it is, and the holiday "must see" along with "It's a wonderful life, White Christmas, a miracle on 34th Street and of course all versions of Christmas Carols.
