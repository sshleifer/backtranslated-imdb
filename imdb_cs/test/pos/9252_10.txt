Not only was this film better than the last H: LOTS season. But it was better than any movie made for television I've ever seen! Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only one small movie did it: How Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I'm just glad I could re-enter the Baltimore Homicide Squad!
