The opening scene of this movie is incredible. I saw a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at myself after the opening sequence and he said clearly, "sensory overload." The storyline of the movie is quite simple, but the nice thing about this science fiction movie is that it allows the audience to find most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time "gently" explaining it. Creatures in this film are also very interesting. You don't really have to look at them up to two-thirds of the way. Very funny movie in general.
