Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Sky? Hell? Parallel Universe? When an annoying man exits the subway platform and meets the boarding train, his next conscious moment occurs on the bus; riding a solo, the latest coming, in a dead underworld where all suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the body biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man who processes and transports annoying man from barren plains to the city, if the eyeballs are functional, the dead bell is a kind of urban land that he once lived, if memory serves him. Andreas retains the appearance of a sleepwalker in trance, a man stolen by people and objects, trying to find his bearings; at home, or rather his assigned apartment; or at work where an annoying man is randomly appointed as an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, "You get used to it," which covers more than just crunchy numbers, we suspect in this world as well as the old world. If life is insignificant, as the French existential philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death. The subculture of office life can be heaven for one man, but it seems to be like hell in the context of "Brysomme Mannen". To work in the afterlife is basically working for the rest of your life. Social intercourse between Andreas's office mates may go as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that causes the viewer to be alienated because he now recognizes the drunkenness of white-collar work done by white-collar workers. Killing the clock with their inconsistent small-talk and determined work they perform during the day, like automotons, every day, seem irrational in their self-evident absurdity. "Den Brysomme mannen" to see everyday life replicated in speculative light makes normal human interaction as a dead comedy because women's life becomes a performance that alters the meaning of "theft" of Karl Marx, because here, men and women in the office, "do "Align with their work, as actors in the game who conspire to make their fictitious self appear real. Annoying man, however, never fully participates in the facade. He is always aware of cracks. From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a ski jump that plunges onto an iron fence while people at lunch break go to him, indifferent to his gut escapes that make red splatters on a clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same disrespect from his own co-workers after deliberately cutting off his own finger, hoping to feel the pain of a paper cutter. He didn't. It's just another feeling, besides being able to taste and feel lost to annoying man. This inability to be able to take comfort in simple pleasures reinforces the need for love that is unpleasant for a man, where simple pleasure compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner held by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They hit it. He goes home. He invites him in. They become a couple. He's moving in. When they have sex, it's not good either for Andreas or for Anna, who seems more pleased with the interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another feeling that is unattainable in this world, but love is important to annoying man, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by introducing its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances as man and woman. When Ingeborg does not create the same feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film will reveal its secrets about a prosaic, but strange city, with an open end that is solvable and offers multiple interpretations. Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy for his love for her, annoying man travels to the same subway station, stands on the same platform, laments on the same couple aggressively and jumps. . This time he can't die. How can you die when you're dead? Repeatedly hit by train after the train, Andreas's face turns into ground beef; his body twists at angles that were previously seen only in art. When an annoying man realizes that love and death are out of reach, he is looking for a man from a club who was willing to say dead in the city. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning. We get to the bottom of the mystery of where Andreas is located, and it is said that the film's mystery is satisfactorily solved in the scene. She recalls Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich" when Andreas walks through the tunnel to get into a world like a newborn baby who resembles Malkovich's brain portal that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl. Andreas's attempt to go through the great abyss is a charming paradox. Given that heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border acts as a perfect encapsulation of atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of hell; a place where Andreas is sent after being deported from his destination city.
