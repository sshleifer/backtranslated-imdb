The sequel is exactly what you expect. And it's good enough that anyone who wants to watch this one should keep him happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that will win the Academy Award. But it does what made the Jackass TV show and the original movie a success, and it turns it notch. It is more fun, brutal and disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute. The original had several notorious pieces, and there is at least one piece that this movie will remember. You will be wince, cringe, look away, and laugh very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably won't have to read this review or others to know if you like this movie if you've never heard of Jackass.
