The Golden Boy is, in my opinion, one of the sleeping / lost treasures. A sexy comedy about a young man searching to find his nitch in life and he's mistaken for all sorts of weird work that somehow has this somewhat sexy girl who eventually falls on him, but he doesn't really realize it! It's really something you can easily miss if you're in the name, but as soon as you look at it ... it falls on the comedy / stupidity that lies inside. Really a crime that produced only 6 OVA episodes and a pilot movie. But it is unique. I was surprised that she survived to make many. If you want a good laugh, with a high quality anime that is (100% CGI free), check this anime out. A boy who can one day save the world .... or maybe not.
