Speaking relatively, if one was only to see now Hector Babenco's "Pixote" (1981, Brazil; pronounced as "pi-shot"), after seeing quite a number of movies dealing with street children, teen offenders, troubled children \ t t (Truffaut's "The 400 Blows", Bunuel's "Los Olvidados", De Sica's "Shoeshine", Nair's "Salaam, Bombay!", Bresson "Mouchette", Nugroho's "Leaf on Pillow", etc) One might be afraid that the unfortunate situation of the boy who is shown in the film may no longer affect them because she was "de-synthesized" after she had gone through the emotional ride on the roller coaster, which had been cited by the previously cited films. Fortunately, it won't be the case. For Babenco, she tells her film in a matter-of-fact way ("blankly" as one reviewer said in a positive light) and that his central child performer, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years old and street boy himself), gives such no-frills, wounded performance, raw in its simplicity (that hardened cheeks, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard to give it not pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can achieve such increased realism when one learns that a child has only been living a short life involved in street crimes and subsequently murdered after the film.) <br /> <br /> About the first half of Pixote and his fellow citizens Children and offenders spend their time in a repressive state reform school where brutalization and humiliation, rape and murder are norms and cultures where they are forced to confess their "crimes". based on the poor idea that under Brazilian law minors are not "punished" for their crimes. For these children, the uncertain freedom offered by the streets is more advantageous than the harsh rehabilitation that these alleged organs do well. In the walls of this supposed protective device, these young souls will soon find that the love and care of the parents are nowhere to be found, if not to the point, that they get worse. The only form of escape comes from the puffy grass and sniffing glue, secretly smuggled inside the reformator.) When children threw themselves into a small "rebellion" to finally express and then fulfill their Collective Desire Return to the outside world - your "home" - the intensity and form of the kind that one cannot avoid thinking about the rebellion of schoolchildren in Jean Vig's influential "Zero for Conduct". It's just that in "Pixote", "rebellion" is made to appear at the eaves level. Once Pixote and his small group are back on the streets (the second half of the film), they deal with robbery, pimping and drug trafficking to take care of themselves, with whom they encounter Sueli, confused, but a kind prostitute. Sueli willingly accompanies the four lost souls in a way that allows them to be robbed by her customers and that she provides more than maternity care (at least one of the children). One would like to think that street children have finally found one person who can provide them with love and warmth that was very lacking in their lives. But just as doubtful as the freedom these children believe the streets provide, this new "mother figure" cannot stay forever. Jealousy, quarrels, differences, and murder just divided children - and well. And during this delimiting scene, where Pixote, fueled by circumstances, gets to shoot not only Sueli's arrogant American customer, but also his Ditto colleague (more than Sueli's son), then he literally returns to "childhood" as he sucks from the right the breast of a disoriented woman, right there and then materializes her persistent desire for parental affection, the image itself sad and disturbing. It's like Sueli, in the likely return to her "senses", lamentably pushes back Pixote from his "nourishing" position and rejects it, well. Pixote, with a young face and annoying eyes (not quite different, though in a different context, with a young boy in El Klimov, who is in the horrible "Come and See"), gets up in a quiet, booming moment. get your coat and take your weapon (yes, weapon!) and go nowhere, walk on the rails of the trains and begin to appear in the morning light. With this scene, Babenco can only make homage (among many other homages found in various movies!) To the iconic final scene in Truffaut's "400 Blows". But while we learned what. three years later, Antoine Doinel in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other feature films in the coming years). since the last film, this is the last time we get to see this street child in real life (regardless of the fate that actually affected him). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be almost as moody as "The 400 Blows" or as hallucinating as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out from movies of similar theme and texture, thanks to its simple strength.
