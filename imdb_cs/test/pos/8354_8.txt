Another good animation from Disney. Sequins are not always so large and tend to follow the same graph as the original. But Tramp's son tries to enjoy the world out of his home and family he knows and learns where he actually belongs. Being a cheeky dog ​​is not for everyone, a dog, but Scamp overcomes adversity. The voices of the various characters were excellent and provided several well-known actors such as Scott Wolf, Alyssa Milano and Mickey Rooney. A fun and well-made family movie.
