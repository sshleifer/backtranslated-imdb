I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and was full of tensions and twists. It grabs you at the beginning and keeps you throughout the film. I've been thinking about this movie over the last few years and I've checked in the video store to see if it is available, but I could never find it even anyone who even heard of it. I think this type of film is timeless, and I know that a whole new generation of movie viewers can enjoy it. I hope it will soon be on the video because it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as in the early 70s. It is very rare that a TV movie can be so impressed, but that was after so many years.
