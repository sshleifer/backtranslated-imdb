I agree with so many other reviewers. That was a great movie and even a better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author died before he saw this film. All performances are highest, with three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) seemingly for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and in Israel, seem to be absolutely authentic and the length of the four-hour miniseries was right for telling this story. Fortunately, I have a DID tape when it was on TV and enjoyed watching it since then. I can say without hesitation that they are still holding up to this day. I gave him a rating of 10. If you didn't read the book, you should really find a copy. This would be an excellent movie to release on DVD with add-ons that could easily include cast interviews.
