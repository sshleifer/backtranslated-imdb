David Cronenberg's "EXistenZ" is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It solves the problems of a culture that is involved in technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality, or between organic and mechanical. The film shocks viewers by replacing mechanical, organic, and metabolic technology. In this context, technology is capable of being part of the human body. After playing the virtual reality of eXistenZ, the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior changes so that violent games can be applied even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that connect directly to the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief, who is a well-known media theorist that computers are an extension of human consciousness. Like a phone's ear extension, television is an extension of the eye, a telegram is an extension of the central nervous system of high-tech virtual reality is an extension of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and is more human than in our world. But as technology becomes organic, people become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their urge. eXistenZ is a virtual reality simulation of human existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book Simulacra and simulation, which all forces to act have been transformed to appear. The world has gone into the simulation itself. In eXistenZ, it is clear that Baudrillard's society is mediated by topics of body invasion, loss of control, and transformation of itself into others. it replaces another identity, its role in the game, which is the reflection of each individual in the real life of the subconscious. Even if you gain control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life will disappear. For Baudrillard, "simulation or simulacra, they have become hyperreal, more than real." Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation, "feels, and for all intents and purposes is more real than what we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game, which can in principle be called "experience", is quite metaphorical. Because you can't even know what an experience is, unless you experience it. As existentialists say, life without an exact explanation is absurd, eXistenZ is also absurd. Cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in play, other roles will remain if you do not ask them for a pre-programmed question. And when you give your aimless witty-looking state of being to the representation of our lives, the revealed absurdity really shocks. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphoric question creates anxiety over people playing eXistenZ. They do not doubt their existence, but they do not know the basic reason for their existence. Essence. Existentialists thought that human beings do not have a solid nature or substance, as other animals and plants do; every human being makes decisions that create his own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher of the 20th century Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes the essence. Therefore, choice is at the center of human existence and is inevitable; the choice is also to reject the choice. Freedom of choice means commitment and responsibility. Because individuals can choose their own way, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility for keeping their commitment wherever they go. Perhaps I should mention, "eXistenZ" also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You make your final role in the game with the right decision. If not, the game becomes untamed and boring. So you start questioning the game, your existence and not your essence. Suddenly you become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position out of the game. As a final word, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse life simulation, ie existentialism. <br /> <br />
