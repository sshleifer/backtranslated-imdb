This production, based on true Danish criminal stories, is an experience thanks to excellent direction, working at all levels and with a nerve that is not often seen in the crime series. Every episode is exciting because the hole team seems to believe that "this is my life right now - this murder or murder is my responsibility to deal with" and the output is brilliant. As a viewer, you just have this beautifully fun, because they feel like their focus, deliberately or not, lie on you to have fun ...: o) Don't miss this, it's right Under the 'Band of Brothers Quality' and 'Must See' Experience - What is a wonderful time of crime!
