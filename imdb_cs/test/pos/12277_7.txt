You must love the western universe of spaghetti. West vision, where good guys get shot without warning, cartoonish villains chew scenery in extreme close-ups, and anti-hero leaves the girl at the end. Many people call Corbucci films 'depressing'. It seems to me that it's a bit risky when it comes to descriptions. I think the bleak and ruthless are more appropriate, mainly because "depressing" suggests a level of sentiment, almost every European director, Eurowestern, has ignored in favor of painting characters in broad moves. before she can take the right place in the canon of Sergio Corbucci. It's a beautiful movie. And it makes sense for Corbucci to blow away a couple of par with COMPANEROS after the one-stroke hit THE GREAT SILENCE (even though he would later return to his usual tricks with SONNY and JED fouls). There's still a certain amount of cartoon that reflects the overall animosity of the film, imo it hurts more than what's good to include unnecessary inclusion of three kids dressed as hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts when Mario Adorf plays El Diablo on the Mexican bandit because he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> These little side grasps are more than enough here to wet the floor of a spaghetti enthusiast. Shootouts galore, the population of the entire city has declined to crawling naked in the dirt, typical iconic nausea of ​​the laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), a moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the film. Corbucci may never get the recognition of more famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre, but we know that this is a gross injustice for a very talented director. His dynamic selection of shots, in-depth with the objects held close to the camera and retreating in the background, his sense of quick stimulation and feverish energy in the movement of the story, which was not always so together, the way he photographs open spaces, everything in his I'm sure if Corbucci was an American and appeared 15 years later with Manne and Hawks, Cahiers du Cinema critics would praise him as the author of worthy serious critical thinking.
