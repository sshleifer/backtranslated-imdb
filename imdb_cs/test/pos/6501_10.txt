it was this film he saw in resfest and was laid. I've never been a big fan of scratching, but this movie let me get hooked from the getg. it is listed as a document but never felt like one. (she doesn't remember the last time I watched a documentary). it has style and energy that is refreshing, bright and never too disciplined. production values ​​were also higher there. (shot on movie with cool cuts and amazing soundtrack). overall smart, fun and informative piece.
