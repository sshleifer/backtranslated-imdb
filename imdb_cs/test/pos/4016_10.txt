A truly unique and stunning film "For the Flag" by Jules Verne by Czech director Karel Zeman. Although the story is published in a somewhat subconscious late Victorian style, the visuals are discarded. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne, which the reader connects in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dora and Bennet and Riou, which illustrate these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies. Photographed in beautiful black and white top-level animation and not Saturday morning varieties. There are underwater sequences where fish swim about are so accurately drawn they can be used in the wizard field. There are paintings of ships, submarines, flying vessels, castles and machines that are drawn in such precise details that one must have a freeze frame on his VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study a notable detail that went into this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that has never been and will please us in the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If that's not enough, there is also a movie score that is probably one of the best ever created for fantasy or sci-fi film. Truly forgotten classic, this is worth hunting and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, will definitely be one of yours. And don't forget - it was decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to great artists who, of course, put their hearts into it. Shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it, love it - and enjoy it. Excellent success, this remarkable film is always better when you watch it. A true film work of a visionary director.
