Maybe it's just a personal affection for this film version of Mike Waltari's novel, or a fondness for Egyptian things (I grew up loving to visit a mummy in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts), but I think Maltin is tad hard on this pretty good. film. Production values ​​are great in terms of color and cinematography, and some effort seems to have gone into historical authenticity (certainly largely from the novel). Purdom is a bit stiff in the lead role, but it can be accepted as part of Sinuhe's character. Victor Mature is Victor, mature. Peter Ustinov is pleased to watch this role he has always done so well and so funny. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefera is a classic camp, and I find that Michael Wilding is rather a dry portrait of Akenaten to have his own challenge. The historical peculiarity of Akenaten's monotheism, a short detour in the theological history of ancient Egypt, is as interesting as Akenaten itself, and is worth reading; religious wars depicted here have a de facto basis. Interesting footnote about Darvi, whose maiden name was Bayla Wegier: She was a Polish emigrant who produced Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet under their wing (I believe they could even accept it. Her first name) Darvi is composed of Zannuck's and his wife's first names, and continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success, and after a somewhat unhappy life she died in 1971 with her own hand. A nice look at visual values ​​The American film classic sometimes shows it in the mailbox that is necessary to capture the scale and movement of the story.
