Yesterday I saw it and it was much better than the other VH1, too bad than this one, which is quite outdated, but you will see all the staff doing the park in the south, very interesting things. It's so funny that this documentary captures Trey and Matt as selfish greedy snobblers who do not work and spend their time having fun or relaxing (which is a bit ironic because it is quite harsh on the series). It also shows all the animation process to make the South Park episode, an interview with actors who brings characters to voices and much more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the South Park I highly recommend you this.
