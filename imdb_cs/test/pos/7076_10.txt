After I rented One Truth One Night, I learned to respect my family and didn't take their health for granted. I've never seen such a form of real life as a cancer victim on screen like Meryl. He deserves an Oscar nomination, but has some tough competitors in the run. All I can say is a beautiful movie, a great performance by Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep unveiled her unique ability in this excellent movie!
