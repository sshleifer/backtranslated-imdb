This film blew me away. I'm one of those people who only risk movies that don't bother me at times, and I have to say that it paid off. I mean, Wow! Even my young guys enjoyed the movie (5 and 6 at the time), although I'm pretty sure it wasn't aimed at their age groups. This movie was also clean, which is a great Plus. It's so great to sit in a movie that you can enjoy without blasphemy, violence (except one very short scene) or anything else that might be morally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> This movie brought you on the road you are so ready to believe because of the great deal. You feel the huge amount of emotions that are displayed along with the characters. I never thought a golf film would have me on the edge of my place, but I couldn't help with intense interest in how this movie would end up. I have nothing to compare, because I haven't actually seen golf before, but they all did a great job of keeping the tempo and emotions captivating. The score also made miracles; excellent, excellent score. Although you don't think it would be your kind of movie, watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I was definitely.
