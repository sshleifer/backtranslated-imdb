This is a horror this year. "House of Wax" is one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. This version really lists the shame of Vincent Price. I only know a few young actors in the movie. Still uncomfortable Paris Hilton; The pain in you knows what seems more seductive than ever. At least she wasn't trying to copy her shame. If she likes horror, she's better than Vanny White's "Wheel of Fortune". Bije Vannu HANDS DOWN! And the scene where "Wax House" was made was not a joke. The house was made of wax and the victims got out of there before the wax got their friends. The two twins Bo and Vincent (deformed twins) were maniacs from get-go. My parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they were just as distorted. How come the other one in the second pickup is scary, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart, not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this film is one of the scariest in 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
