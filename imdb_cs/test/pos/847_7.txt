Okay, everyone agreed on what's the best season. First. And killing Boone was a bad thing. Killing others was also bad. He blames directors and writers for this. Bad boys. BUT. I still think it's the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys, I can't help it! I can see that the quality of the series has declined after the first season. It's easy to take Liam as the new main character if you're over Boone. It's really ... mysterious. I was most shocked when Lilli was written from the story and how. That was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde named Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you are still interested in real plans to end. Real suspension. Conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. I understand that when you jump on season 3, 4, or 5 episodes, you don't need to understand this show. But when you look from the beginning, you just can't relax! <br /> <br /> Acting is great, special FX is amazing, music is beautiful and the action is interesting. I gotta see it, guys!
