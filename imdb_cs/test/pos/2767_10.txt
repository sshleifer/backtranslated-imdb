This movie was played on Disney Channel all the time when I was a little younger and I really remember it. But at the time I didn't have a great taste (I'm not saying I'm doing it now) so I can't guarantee my nine-year-old too well. The movie was about 7/10, but he had some good music so I gave him an extra point. Yeah, it's worth watching. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what a song is - the one that appears when it's in a car accident. The song is "Play Love Love" by Jaguars and it is very hard to find and get. In fact, this movie is too. I can't find it anywhere online or on DVD or VHS. I'd like to see it again, so I can guess if it was a good movie. Oh, good.
