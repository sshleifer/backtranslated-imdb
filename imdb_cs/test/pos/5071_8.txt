CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) will see his first secret questioning when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of contacting a known terrorist manufacturer. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is frantic about her husband's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> Do you hate it when the movie title sends you to a dictionary? I have to have an old edition because this edition is not a musical work. No, it's a way of government, how to legally take a former citizen or citizen to question him, and maybe use some torture to get the information he wants. Watching this movie, I reminded myself of a similar story on the TV show Crossing Jordan (now out of the air) and I expect to see even more of these storylines. It's inevitable. Events 911 are catalysts. It's hard to follow because we don't like people being tortured and our government is not telling the truth about things. We like the idea that no matter what happens or happens, we can go somewhere to find answers, but when the door is closed for us, we are really lost and hopeless as Anwar's wife was. The performance of everyone was first class and it is possible that we will see more Igai Naor (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because he resembles and can act as Telly Savalas. No fun.
