The tribute of Jean Renoir to Paris from the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways. Not only was it photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, but it portrays the geographical Paris; on the streets that are accessible only by the staircase, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with the product being sold in the uncompromising image of the show business, which is in stark contrast to the Hollywood picture. There is an obvious comparison being made with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", which was made about 20 years ago, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dance feeling, a fresh-faced boy from the poles who came to New York to get into the show business who will save the show when the star fails - "You're out of the church boy out there, but you gotta get back!" "Julian Marsh" Warner Baxter is a director who suffers from his art and is underrated. "Danglard" Jean Gabina still struggles with genital policy, but when she talks about the show, she's more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. It's all about the game, except - for its pointed thing. He has a profitable new business sewn until his lover is jealous of a woman he knows as his next mistress. His prospects go up and down with every coal way he takes. Danglard takes Mrs. 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) to dive into a dive where she sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo Baker, and finds out She is a lively dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to study dance so that she can go on stage. The prospect of money and the glory of magic Nini, and she becomes Danglard the next mistress, as well as the apt cancan student, which Danglard dubbed the "French Boar," catering to the current Anglophile tendency in dance. Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are honors to show business - modern entertainment - that has its own iconography and its own conceit. "42 st." is centered around Julian Marsh, a great Broadway show director who organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual participation. The juvenile male is a middle-aged twin lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, a nice tenor with the secret wealth hiding. On the other hand, Danglard goes from woman to woman, seduces them with a promise of glory and covers them in what must have been very convincing. There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and is quite active. Postcoital scenes abound. Days after seducing Nini away from Paul, Esther, a type of Piaf, discovered and began to prepare her for her work of singing film songs while playing the violin. . Obviously, Nini's jealousy is just as exciting as jealousy about Lola. (And of course, Nini has already been given the privilege of being Czarina!) The whole film is about how Danglard's balance sheet cost him money, but how his unpleasant horror is subordinated to his love of show - how viewers require devotion - - and that is this powerful combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard a hero while claiming that a true show lover will never win as much as men's money. At the end of the movie, Danglard, have outfoxed lenders and jealous babes, approaches to new attraction to watch the incredible (and believe me, this is incredible) cancan performance. "Have you ever thought about being on stage?" he asks and the curtain descends. Meanwhile, poor Julian is sitting on the theater's fire escape and listening to new Peggy Sawyer fans who disagree with his contribution to the show's success. (I won't even go to the central line of "42nd Street", "Oh, Guy, that was GRAND of you, CONTINUE!") <br /> <br /> Next, I won't get one of the legendary Parisian entertainers, including Piaf's short vision , nor the vision of Paris as urban and rural. Certainly there is a pattern of styles that aroused Trenet and Aznavour. But it is a memory of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something invisible in every Hollywood musical that can be compared is a pleasant relief from Androgyn's Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell), let alone the barf renowned MGM in movies as a repulsive "American in Paris". All those fountains! We will save our comparison of this turkey with "Breakfast at Tiffany" and its deconstruction of the American man for the next day. That Danglard can be a promising vision of its kind in post-war France. a hyper-masculine sword that may or may not exist is practically next to a point. That man is a man, neither John Wayne, nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more at the finish. That he is a man who likes ladies is never in doubt. For one, I wouldn't mind living his life at all. I wonder if it was Gabin. At the beginning of this commentary I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I never got that far. Baz is a Moulin Rouge ... well, Paris no longer gives this kind of stuff to the Seine.
