Can the film be too faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging by Khaled Hosseini's 2003 adaptation, the answer is somewhat ironic "yes." Like many, I was fascinated by this book, an impressive first effort by an Afghan-American writer / doctor. Apparently it was director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pays close attention to the most important details of the story within the 127-minute film period. However, the Hosseini novel goblins of heartfelt events often come across episodic and shortened because Forster and Benioff are honestly trying to remain faithful to the full story in time constraints. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide a literary, then-and-now symmetry to what is essentially a story of three acts, a technique that may come across as somewhat fanciful on the screen. However, the creators do the most important things correctly, specifically giving the viewer an intimate insight into the hidden culture so far transported through CNN news reports, ensuring authenticity by speaking characters in the Dari Persian dialect of the Afghan language, and capturing emotional involvement complex story. The first part of the film is released in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the possible takeover of the Taliban. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Baba, and a devotee of Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Joining their mutual love kite kite, the two are thick as thieves, until the tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage that is so natural to his father, Amir is blamed for not having saved Hassan from an unspeakable act done by a trio of local rapists. Forster makes a particularly tangible ethnic tension between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan. On the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops, Amir and Baba flee to the US where the story picks up their story nine years later in Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigrants. Baba is limited to working at a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the most interesting passage of the film, because Benioff's treatment gives a short shift to supporting characters such as Amir's wife Soraya and most critically, Amir is portrayed by necessity as a restrained young man with a falling direction towards his self-esteem. The last section flashes ahead twelve years where Amir, after the publication of his first book, is summoned back to the Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to save Hassan's son from the Taliban, as a means of atoning his cowardice years earlier. True tension and fear appear in this part of the story, because the shocking revelations and old acquaintances return to Amir during his journey. The British actor of Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (leading hijacker "United 93") has the central role of Amir as an adult, challenging role because he must convey a constant sense of shame and diminished self-worth until the end. Other professional actors eat better - Shaun Toub (Savior of Tony Stark Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as a business partner to Baba Rahim Khan, who holds the key to truth; Atossa Leoni quietly intervened as Soraya; and best of all, Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi, who brings Baba pride and dignity. Three young non-professionals were recruited from Kabul's school system to play key children's roles, and they are all pretty good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is at the challenge of the toughest part as young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is crazy as Hassan's almost catatonic son Sohrab. But he's a sad eyed, Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, who faces a lunar face that breaks your heart like young Hassan, especially in a devastating scene of throwing pomegranate. It is fair to say that his performance is on an equal footing with the young Enzo Staiola in Vittorio de Sica "Bicycle Thieves". The technical aspects are good, especially the pure cinematography of Robert Schaefer (Western China's convincing replacement for Afghanistan), the evocative score of Albert Iglesias and even the effects of CGI that show dragons in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid set of add-ons, from staged comments by Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, though some of their dialogues seem to be forced. There are two featurettes included - the first is the 14-minute "Words from Kite Runner", which focuses on Hosseini's connection to the story and the development of the novel, and the second is the 25-minute "Pictures From Kite Runner" to produce. " Supplements are complemented by an original theater trailer, several previews and PSA from Hosseini on how to help Afghans in their present need.
