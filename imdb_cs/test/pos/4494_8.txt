Kite Runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I've read in the recent past. Maybe I had very high expectations of the movie, but still the movie was good, the whole environment looked realistic. nothing happened. dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were right. The film wasn't a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes when it got really emotional and even the toughest man would probably shout. see the movie. But overall a good movie to see for those who are not readers. But the reader-novel would be a better experience, so if you ever want to see a movie, read the novel first and then compare it with the movie.
