This is a funny movie. Bob & Eddie Show feel it could lead to a sequel, but I doubt there will be enough money. Deniro proves that he can once again be a great man with some cheerful and spontaneous moments. Eddie was entertaining to watch people working instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo - just as fun to watch as well and play a great role. Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage scene. Worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and a lot of the movie and great out-take at the end. DO NOT USE credits at the beginning! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
