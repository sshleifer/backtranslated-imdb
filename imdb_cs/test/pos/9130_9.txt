Commissaire Mattei (André Bourvil) is a small pistol single who loves cats and his boss at the Paris Police Department is a philosopher who knows that even the police are guilty sooner or later. That's what the whole movie is about. A jewel robbery at Vendome. Corey (Delon) brings a plan from prison, Vogel (Volonté) joins him and helps him against the two hard guys behind him because he took the mobster Ricos (Andre Eycan) while Rico he had already taken girlfriend Coreys and left him alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen (Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand-made ammunition into the hole. A perfect plan and collaboration, but they have to sell prey and there is Mattei in the role of buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other are shot by cats loving Mattei and his little gun. Melville took 20 years saying to be a robbery movie after failing to get a RIFFIFI contract. Melville wrote and wrote the script in the south of France and in Paris. Great Henri Decae is as usual lighting cameraman. It is one of Melvilles' previous pictures, which died after another film with Delon in 1972. Melville wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he didn't like the Italian at all, but Volonté-Vogel is an excellent refugee and gives Bourville the most convincing performance. But remember: Melville notes that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tiring and utterly impossible on the French scene. He didn't like Melville at all and didn't want to work with him again. Melville is bad. Volonté give the liveliest character in nowhere so many interesting characters. You can see what feels like Mattei and his little dangerous weapon and all the dogs of France in the winter 70. Wild actor. Also, André Bourvil, who died near the shooting time. He was also not the first choice, but certainly a great replacement. He carries the lone hunter's instinct through the film and finally gets the chance to become guilty again. Jansen entered the jewelry shop at night with a rifle and a tripod, but the risks eventually shot. When he first meets Delon, we already know that elegant Jansen has a serious drinking problem. After the robbery, Montand surrenders his part of the loot and mentioned Delon, who looks at him as he only got into the red circle because he wanted to avenge the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon won't catch what he means. Viewers remembered seeing Montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly the nightmare of the creatures coming out of the closet and attacking him. At that time a very rare scene, one recalls long after. I bet it was so hard to get things right and nobody imagined the upcoming days of making a digital movie. Great artwork when art was made by hand. We will certainly remember the crew, such as the actors, it still seems that even after 33 years it will remain less popular from the six Melville thrillers. What's wrong with that? I'm afraid they don't care much about these three actors (with three criminals) and their police hunters. We learn too little about Corey and his deadly 5 years from his beautiful girl (Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a man with drinking water with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon behaves as if he was in an earlier adventure of samourai, Volonté is a man in the trunk of an American car, Delons, and moving great, and Mattei is close by to look, a great actor on the edge of his life. But how could he ever doubt everyone was guilty? In an interview, Melville says there is no woman in the movie. Not in a very red circle, but I remember that a cheerful, good-looking woman, Anna Douking (no future career). We are in the 70's. In fact, the woman is floating from an old mafia bed wearing nothing, and walks slowly to the door to hear the voice of her old lover, Delon. Bardot did something like this 10 years ago. This time Melville drove. Good work. RED CERCLE certainly added a few but not many shimmering gems to the film's history. The Magnifier at Place Vendome and the Theater Theater Montands wardrobe occupants and the Volonté escaped Bouvil in white underwear and carefully pulled their trousers over the stream. That's too little for a great gangster and a robbery movie. But 110 minutes have never bored you and it's a high-level game. And there are probably some secrets that you will learn when you see the film over and over again. No secret is that we are all guilty and that the late Francois Perier also appears. Michael Zabel
