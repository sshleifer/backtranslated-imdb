This film has remained in my mind for several years as one of the best mysteries I've ever seen. Acting is excellent. I've seen it twice and I'm still confused in some parts. I'd like to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can't find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions on how to find it? I tried e-bay, Amazon.com, internet search and I'm completely frustrated. I haven't seen him on the Classic Movies tour, nor on American Movie Classics, and I've even put out leaflets in our community to see if anyone has a copy.
