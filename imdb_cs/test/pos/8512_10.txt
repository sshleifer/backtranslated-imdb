People criticize the NSNA because it is a low-point in Bond God's Sean Connery career, and because it is unofficial. *** CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS * First, this movie is better than any other bond movie with any other actor than Connery, all sub par wannabes in my book. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, no one is close to his hardness, good looks and sex-applause. Yes, this film is a low point in Connery Bond's career, but it's still the best 80's best film ever. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good at older age. he did not become a baggy mess like Moore, but he retained good looks and tenacity, but gained some gray hair. So what? hes is still the only real 007, and is as cool and hard as ever. Sean Connery is one and just 007. And this movie is definitely worth seeing, no matter what someone says. No gun hole, but you can't have everything, huh? great song theme, though.
