A group of unpleasant teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become obsessed with demons that have accidentally woken up. Obedient teenagers are starting to kill others and they seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade), who floats and speaks a really deep voice. The remaining juveniles who have not yet been obsessed are forced to fight demons and try to escape from the house. This is a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects, including Linnea Quigley (which usually has a few nude scenes) pulling the guy's eyeballs and pushing a lipstick tube into her lipstick. There is also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. This is a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. But terrible acting and cruel dialogue will almost destroy him. Overall, I gave him 7 out of 10.
