This film by well-known Czech director and writer co-worker Petr Jarchovský is remarkable for its individuality, but unpleasant and disturbing detail. He focuses on Robert Graves' theme and poem, dealing with a woman with several men and some unpleasant relatives in her life who are trying to survive and protect their two children, Lucina (15-year-old Mrs. Mrvik) and blond asthma. Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem is a lot of evidence, but a topic - a little lost. Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Kráska and Jarda (Roman Luknár) lost everything in the Prague floods in 2002 and they have nothing, but they seem to have good sex, which go with such a revenge in their small apartment that Lucina and Cuba, in front of the TV, must keep their ears away from the noise. Hrebejek relishes such pronunciation and skating at the edge of embarrassment or shock. There is no good explanation as to why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to deal with stolen cars in a large garage adjacent to his apartment. His auto-thieving cohort leaves a classy Volvo, which the carefree Beneš (Josef Abrham) left with the keys in the ignition when visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is involved in watching satellites in such cases that lead the cops directly into Jardy's garage and he and his cohort are gone to jail. "Beauty in trouble escapes to a good angel, Who can count on," begins Graves poem, but in fact, Fracas leads Benes to Marcel when he meets her at a police station. and how to drink wine and throws it on a picture book about Tuscany, where, even though he was born in Prague, he owns a beautiful villa and spent most of his life, he is here to regain a house in Prague, now occupied by a couple of old and sick Benes's gesture is benevolent, even though he does not prevent Jard from leaving prison. Under these circumstances, Marcel must retreat with Lucina and Cuba to rely on her mother's charity, Zdena (John Brejchova) and much less amorous grace of the current husband Zdena, a skinny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer) - who begins for children when he commits a cardinal sin of eating dietetic cookies, like an uncle from the At this point, Jiří Schmitzer can carry the film and never want to go, even on the last scene, he is a threatening threat. It is surprising that the unpleasant Richard does not sexually abuse one or both children. She insists that Marcela has to get out herself, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing, he and Richard become unlikely allies. Unlikely - maybe unlikely. Why would Benes like him? But what is Benes's whole story? Some things give the film too much information and others, not enough. Sure "Good Angel," Benes is an infallibly kind - and polished, good-looking elderly man whose behavior fits his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end that when the overwhelming inhabitants move to the limits of their Prague property, it proves that he is not the one who is not allowed to lie down and walk. It is also necessary to deal with Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova) and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But it's just another wild card that doesn't raise the decks. The poem has been set to music in Czech translation and is sung on screen by accordionist-singer Raduza, first on a tiny scene, then in a more widespread staging on a prison performance that is shown by Jarda and the car thief. If you respect Hrebejk as an author, you can enjoy this sequence; otherwise they feel unreasonable. Also included is a series of Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglová songs from the Oscar, the award-winning Irish music movie 'Once', including the song "Falling". They feel more out of place than they would otherwise be because of their familiarity with "once" - even though this movie came first. Hrebejk's people are arrested; even little Koba has his Shakespearean moments and the riches of magic; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to turn and drag. The property hassle Benes can be useful to show that it has a hard side. But such a complicated demonstration was not necessary. Acting is fine and amazing with unpredictability and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money are lost in conflicts and Marcel's conflicts and how they deal with them are never clear. It's okay that there is no distinction and a true theme and Graves' poem, which Marcela still has with sex with Jarda when returning to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and children. But there are too many questions about what to do with the unpleasant Richard or Jarda's unpleasant mother of gods (Emilia Vasarya). How do we suddenly learn that Koba receives letters from "India", allegedly from his father who is in jail? When did it happen? Interesting details, hurriedly inside. It seems to be a world where you don't see a forest for trees.
