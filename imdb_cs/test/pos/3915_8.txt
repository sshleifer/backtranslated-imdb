I saw this movie at his opening night and enjoyed it. I would probably enjoy it more if I was not sitting at my father's. My father saw the original (unfortunately I haven't seen it yet) and spoke the whole thing. He kept saying that he was sucking the film and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that filmmakers are making fun of the horror genre. Each horror movie always shows a certain character. If they weren't in the movie, you wouldn't like it too much. Trademark Signs are: <br /> <br /> "Leading Character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "Leading Character Friend": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "Soon-To-Be Reformed" Jerk ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The Annoying Sluttish Character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" Characters That Are Just Close To Look Nice ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) > <Br /> With these characters it is easy to predict who will die and who will live. Of course you know who will be with what I just wrote. The film can be predictable (in fact, I had a pretty good idea to die just by watching the trailer), but that was still nice. It may seem stupid (why is there a patisserie in the middle of an abandoned camp that wasn't there?) Occasionally, but it's very easy to follow. Comedies and gore were the perfect amount for the weak stomachs who do it, but they don't want me wrong (less than "Final Destination 2"), but it works very well. as hot as the fire set went up, but the temperature could still burn "wax".
