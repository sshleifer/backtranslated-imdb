This film is undoubtedly the best I've seen in my whole life. Star Star Cast is just a bonus in addition to amazing special effects and deep story and noble choreography. The film is about an ancient love affair that unfolds into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven give the wrath of the great sage and are cursed. Subsequently, the woman was born again on earth. While she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film basically focuses on hunting people who have been linked to rape, its lover who has superhuman strength and mastery of several languages. Son Nigam brings a very mature and profound performance in this movie and all the other actors do it almost the same. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are overwhelming and must not be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
