There was once someone in my family (not to say who it is because of personal reasons) who thinks Mr. Bean is always so stupid in what he does on a comedy series. Imagine how I felt then. Shocked instantly. There are more reasons than one, why I love Mr. Bean's observation. Being one of the oldest shows on local TV here in my country where I first grew up is just one of those things that got stuck in my head. There were even once my friends and I talked about a few selected episodes and we laughed together. Though lately it may sometimes show some of the repetitions here, it never succeeded in bringing back those memories of my childhood. In fact, I can say that this is the first performance ever to introduce me to the kind of shows that come from the UK when I grew up. <br /> <br /> A comedy series ... definitely bad, as the British say.
