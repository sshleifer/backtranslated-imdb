This is a great movie. I found it full of wonderfully unexpected pain that I was a free father of a teenage girl. And it is set in a tropical island paradise. Gerard Depardeiux brings his story to a divorced father of a teenage girl. They are on vacation together and she begins to add to the excitement of the island in many unexpected ways. But you'll have to see the movie for yourself to see all the cheerful situations that they find for themselves. There are several cult classics that all teens should see. This movie should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Off Day, Bill and Ted's Great Adventure, Picture Show and Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, my father should be asked to film a film. Look at it as if you had a teenage daughter and you laugh laughing. Watch it with your teen daughter and get ready for a few months.
