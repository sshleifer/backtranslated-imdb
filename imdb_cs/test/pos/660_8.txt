He saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find a pleasant and romantic movie that captures the time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of time, which is long gone, is truly captured in this little film. Acting is above average and Richard Gere's short appearance as a war hero Raider Marine, who is shocked by the shell, is very interested in the film enthusiast or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his first-class design and looks like an All-American boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was charged as B. Kirby, Jr.) has a mass role as "Pop", Peace-Love, Marine Corp refuse, dreaming of returning home to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for action and adventure, the same is true. But if you want to recapture innocence, honor, romance and love in America, then Baby Blue Marine is for you.
