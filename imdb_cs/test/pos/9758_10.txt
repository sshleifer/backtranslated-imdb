I can't believe it was 25 years since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered that I touched her very much and was lucky to get a VHS tape a few years ago. I haven't seen it yet. I've been watching him ever since. I had to watch it ten times in the last two weeks. Acting is excellent, the story is convincing and I am embarrassed to say that I have not yet known actor Bryan Brown's talent. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean a stolen medicine in Malaysia, there is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous tongues, which are shown in the second half: in their first drink together in Kaines and the homestead tour. We have to wait for the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene, to see his open show of affection for Jean. Same dance eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaya. Who wouldn't want to be his Mrs. Boong? While Joe changed from an oblique, almost larger than life figure in the Malaya jungle to a somewhat confident average Joe in his own backyard, Jean embarked on the opposite road; Her war experience seems to have given her new confidence. She didn't waste any time and went after what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - just as Joe had once told her. All these transformations help me show that it's more than a love story. the story of growth, courage, and instability of life. Attorney -Noel is both a sweet and a sad character. He also gave a lot to Jean - he gave his last hope of love. Finally, he did what true love requires - he gave his happiness to himself. <br /> <br /> I liked the fight between Joe & Jean who wasn't in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition to helping the surfaces of internal struggles that both of them had to deal with to put their lives together. Now I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. However, I am surprised to see that B. Brown has blue eyes in the promo photo on this page. He certainly didn't do in "City as Alice." Well, 25 years is a long time!
