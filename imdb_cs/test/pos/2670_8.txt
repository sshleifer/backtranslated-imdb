This short subject has gathered the way out of all kinds of places for its plea for religious tolerance. After sitting in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and comes to a group of children who beat each other because he was Jewish. He told them that only the American icon could speak of the importance of prejudice and what we were fighting against the Nazis. Meaning could not be clearer. Both songs from this short theme have been uploaded and sold for Columbia Records. But if you're a dream and a song written for the movie, the house I live in. He is one of the best songs about the idealized version of America, we all want to strive for it. Sinatra actually recorded The House I Live In Again during the 1960s for a joint album. did for his record company Reprise. The album is now a rarity and it shouldn't be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians conducted the orchestra with Nelson Riddle. Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's primary music conductor and arranger during the 1940s. When he died he finally got to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl makes an orchestration for the short and Columbia record, Riddle for Reprise Record. Sinatra aficionados and others should listen back to back and compare. And catch this valuable movie whenever it is displayed.
