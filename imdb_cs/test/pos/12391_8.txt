Emilio is a successful business man, a perfect father and a good husband. Or that's what everyone thinks. The perfect story he has built up over the years has suddenly closed around him. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well-structured drama, with great acting and a stable direction. Although the plot is pushed up to increase tension, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we deal with? Can we be so sure? The story is developing at an ever faster pace as it reaches a point where Emilio no longer has control over his lies. Many Spanish films have interesting stories, but they are far from being technically proficient. Perfect rhythm and well-shot scenes make actors so trustworthy, we get inside Emilia, we hate him and suffer for him because his situation is becoming more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor this attempt to create a Hollywood-style movie. This is real Spain, 2002, and despite the apparent improbability of Emilia's existence in reality, there are good chances that someone we know is not quite like the person he claims to be. Not only is it a great commercial product, it will allow you to think about where lies can get us. Can we keep up? <br /> <br /> Good work.
