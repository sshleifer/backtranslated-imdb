Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time I have had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror enthusiast and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty bloody. I'm not a big fan of matches, but Kane was really pulling this monster. I have to admit, I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but I'm very glad I did. During and after the movie, I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake of horror movies enough. I think that's why this movie gets some good reviews. It's a refreshing change and takes you back to The Texas Chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no CGI crap.
