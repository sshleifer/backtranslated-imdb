Very nice movie! I went through the channels on TV and usually ignored the channels that broadcast the drama movies, but then I saw this channel that broadcasts movies from the old schools and where I saw this movie. Initially, when I saw the title "The Cure", I thought it would be boring but then I was addicted to seeing Brad Renfra in this movie (because one of my favorite movies of all time is "The Client" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes improved and improved. The story is so beautiful and touching! I screamed in this movie, which I usually won't do. Great Casting! And there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that is very noticeable and made me cry hard! Now I bought my own copy on DVD and always recommend it to everyone!
