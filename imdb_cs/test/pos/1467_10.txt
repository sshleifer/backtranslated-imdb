This movie is a very beautiful and slow movie. There's nothing about Hollywood. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film to deal with this transsexual theme. It's really about love that has no sex. I wouldn't say it's about lesbian love, even though the two main characters (Transsexual Veronica and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It's a story about love and life. The story takes place in two apartments. There is hardly any background music, making it more realistic and intense. Both actors playing the main characters are great. They really seem to be real. They are not archetypes, but real people you can meet on the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual portray this well. Very good.
