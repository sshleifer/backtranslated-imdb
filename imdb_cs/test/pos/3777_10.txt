Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. Michael McGuire was a dad. Tim Thomerson was a plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Did you even see this movie? I doubt it! Blankfield was quite popular at this time for playing the doctor on Friday. Thomerson was funny in anything he did, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie from HBO back in '82 and largely worn tapes. One of the funniest is the Jekyll & Hyde theme at all. Of course. with all cocaine references in this film, it would be panned as being too politically incorrect today, as would Cheech and Chong. Too bad because it's FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!
