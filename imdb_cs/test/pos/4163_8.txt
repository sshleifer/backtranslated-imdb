I never thought I'd say it about biopsy, but there is almost an excessive abundance of characterization (especially when it comes to Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little in the literal events in his life - in the end, I'm not sure if he dies, or if his sister finally dies (he's got it) or if the director spent too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inner joke, if you missed it - Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). However, this insight inside the mind of a writer who "sketched poetry and fairy tales out of his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining and emotionally strong. All this despite the fact that everyone is animated like animals (like in many Miyazawa stories). Some of the visuals are truly stunning, especially given that they were a TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the birds with the left to the blue light) compete with parts of Fantasy. However, I still can't build a computer animation when mixed with cellular animation. CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more than Anastasia's train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
