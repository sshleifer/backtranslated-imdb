I'm a huge fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His films often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Whether it is obsessive love in 'Splendor in the Grass', poverty in 'tree grows in Brooklyn' or racism in 'gentlemen's agreement'. When I was looking for other films made by Kazan, I came across a film based on Arthur Miller's novel. The film called "Focus" plays William H. Maca (who is one of my favorite actors by chance) and Laura Dern. Anti-Semitism deals with a very realistic way. It seems that Macy's character goes along with the fanatics in his neighborhood and his work until he personally influences him. That's the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was bad and he wanted to stand up, he acted because he was now considered an outsider, and he started to look the same, the same notes and the same brutally that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) has experienced. The film is very well written and well done. Meat Loaf does an amazing job of playing a bag of dirt! The performances of Macy and Dern are excellent! It's easier in life to go along with instead of going against. Sometimes, in order for people to stand up, they must have an impact on their lives or on the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
