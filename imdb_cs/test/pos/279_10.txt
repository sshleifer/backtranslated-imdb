In moments of despair, they were willing to do anything to win. I loved how the lavishness of Maple Leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. Acting was more accurate, far from receiving a pig pet that gives the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great cuts! At the end of a short period of time, I felt that it was a bit incomplete, but it is also life, and that was the life and artistic waltz of the film masterpiece. Sorry when I rinsed the cheesecake, but I think it's acceptable at certain times. The two scenes I have to point out are: Bathtub and the scene on the couch. The couch scene for Tess was the decisive moment and the 360 ​​human condition. All the time I saw her as rude, but now we see her real reality. Her mind spoke before her heart. I need to say more about the bath scene.
