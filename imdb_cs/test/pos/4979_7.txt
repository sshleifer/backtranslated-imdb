John Parrish is a former Union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land Wilkison at Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is so low and when they start bullying Parrisha and his workers, he has a change of heart, especially when things are done brutally towards the worse. Originally after watching this I had a feeling of frustration, mainly because of the cast that was involved. When you have Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope to get the story and the scenario from which they will stand out. Sadly, they have no chance of producing Western classics that deserve multiple returns. Well, I slept on it and decided to think about this picture. I think so, it is fair to say that the actors in question deserve a better story from which to work, it is when everything is said and done, a conspiracy that has been milked for everything worth it , and then some. However, violent men are still a very beneficial film regardless of the unused opportunities that are evident in production. Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as an Eskimo's nose and it's always great to see Babs Stanwyck playing a bitch because he's good at it. While Eddie G, when you get used to being in the West, is okay in what's written. The last minute Robinson, when he first decided that Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford was hurt, is the shortest change made by the creators, even with the support of characters such as the evil Wade Matlock, who is smiling Richard Jaeckel} and Judith Wilkison (shining Dianne Foster) leave something. But for what it is, Robinson's crutches toting "bad" guy is at least unforgettable for all the right reasons. It is not shy to action and to play the weapon, it is with the twists and almost Shakespearean tragedy that Rudolph Maté's film rises above the secular, all beautifully framed by the stunning Burnett Guffey cinematography. Lone Pine in Alabama has been used on many Western images (see Seven Men for Now for Another Famous Use), but here Guffey really excels and can dazzle his eyes at every turn. Violent men are not a great Western image, and perhaps a better director than Maté could really give Donald Hamilton the {The Big Country} novel an adaptation that you can take pride in. But for every nigg and irk I personally had with it, I found two more reasons why I really like it so it is, it's recommended, definitely. 7/10
