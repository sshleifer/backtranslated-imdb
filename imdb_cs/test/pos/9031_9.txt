It's too bad to want to deny the reality of Faulkner and Clarence Brown's intentions in creating the story and movie "Alien in the Dust". I assume that the burden of the history of racism is difficult for every Southern to carry, and I understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to rent a big letter) iameracing, there are many many places where blacks and white people in the south are getting pretty good. But to deny the way blacks and sometimes still have to live, the conditions and injustices they had to endure are not imaginary. Some black and white people have sometimes gotten due to true affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as the blacks knew their place. The point is that Juan Hernandez's character (in film and print) is somewhat pricked, not warm and fuzzy, to underline the fact that fanaticism is bad and in itself and that human rights are just for everyone, regardless of whether we like individuals or not. It would be good if we stopped denying the existence of racism and the great damage he had done to the Americans from all the belts. The fact is that blacks (among other things) were not, as a rule, the exception that would benefit from the justice system as well as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing might claim that these things weren't as widespread as some think, and would probably want to justify their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be wonderful if the southern ancestors of the iameracing (if any) never participated in any of the terrible racist acts that are wrecking the country's history, and I hope not. If we congratulate them, this fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others have done it. And while the terrible things that were done to the blacks in the south (and other areas, let's not forget about the riots in the Civil War era) were only half, the number was only a third, making them less terrible? Is the murder of ten children hanging up ten men of sexual assault on ten women less terrible than the same things happening to a hundred? Iameracing asks us to get the "Mississippi Burning" chip off our shoulders before we see "Alien in the Dust", and I'll ask you, are they doing murder of civil rights activists? Why should it be forgotten? Forgiven? Maybe. However, in order to prevent them from recurring, even smaller events cannot be forgotten. The racism depicted in "Intruder In The Dust" is shown quite intentionally here. It's there to make it happen. <br /> <br /> It is so ridiculous at the kinematic historical level that iameracing is reduced from racial angle. Every movie viewer who was filmed sixty years ago knows that black actors / characters / extras were usually intentionally cast. Judging from our film history; wars were always fought by middle-aged white men; There were no blacks in the Old West; it was possible to walk down the street in a big city and never meet a black person; There were no black hospitals, taxi drivers, clerks, vendors, etc. Blacks were almost never occupied with regard to the role if the race was not a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) wanted to tell a simple murderous story, he probably wouldn't have made Hernandez's character black. Racism exists iameracing. I'm sure we both wish we didn't do it for various reasons. We would like it to be the way we want it to be, so that it is not likely to help, but it still does not.
