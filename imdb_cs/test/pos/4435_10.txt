It is a profound and moving work about the creation of art that is uniquely human and cannot be made by nature, the price of genius, and the search for transcendence, and what ultimately represents the family, that is, all of us. The family discussion that Nathaniel and his sisters had about his father's shortcomings as I found myself in the beautiful house that radiated the heat Lou had created was very impressive. And while Esther seems so cold in his discussion of Lou's inability to make money, you can appreciate how she had to counterbalance her ideas in many places of her life. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all the people in Louise's life got involved in it and became part of his work as his genius. Yes, or perhaps above all, our failures make us who we are. And of course there are buildings. I only knew Lou Kahn by name, and his name wasn't actually connected to his work, they were proof of grace. Maybe one day there will be a building where we will all be fit, and it will certainly resemble the Lou Kahn building, perhaps an undeveloped temple in Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
