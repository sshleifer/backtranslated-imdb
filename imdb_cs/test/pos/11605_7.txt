I agree with what Mallicka.b said. The movie is displayed in a way that seems to be a kind of defamation of the original content. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I think that some of the poor performances contributed to his mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would be a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes she looks a little lusty, which is not what the movie should show. I also noticed a little exaggeration in some scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwaryi Rai :) I can't help him; Sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali when I saw the raincoat; I wasn't impressed at all.
