Werner Herzog re-examines the human psyche. In "Little Dieter ..." we meet a brilliant, brilliant man who survived the war in Bavaria when he saw starvation and strange relics, moved to the US and fulfilled his dream of being an airplane. War, food, death, survival, accumulation, airplanes, heads ... ... as one American was born. Again, Herzog sees madness as the plane of existence and surrealistic mixture with annoying, as Herzog himself tells this psychic German travelogue that becomes an American who flies helicopters at the end of the 20th century, when the culmination of technology, pilgrimage and eating spoons can be melted with constant optimism for a person who is redefined to American. As always with Herzog, we are confronted with floral madness, brilliance and what is human in the face of his own excesses, social and personal. Laughing and crouching and being amazed by this man. Where else for this man, but America?
