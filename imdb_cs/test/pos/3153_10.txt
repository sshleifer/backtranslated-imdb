I waved my brain for another movie that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that deal with this subject (war, peace, violence) are in a solid documentary style. There are some amazing, all are better known than the US TM. they should be informative and bring their emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD may seem more intellectual in some ways, but it is not. Perhaps it is philosophical, but it bypasses the information regime and goes directly to the same place that music does. You feel, but sometimes you don't even know why. You're just somewhere on the wave of feeling. When you look at it, notice how well it is together. This may not be for everyone, but it is for anyone looking for a rare film creature that respects you.
