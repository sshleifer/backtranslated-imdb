He loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love characters. Really Really Loved Geeks! I was thrilled to see the stupid horrors that are still honored. It was up with my favs like Saturday 14th and Pandemonium. If you're a big fan of scary and stupid, then it's your movie! She only took one star because I would like to have a better sound. It's not a bad sound, but I'd like to have more. Big Blood Splatters. Big murder weapons. Big costumes! I really like nodding to a great teenager stereotype of 80's ala breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI tension. Really good camera action and light tension instead of cutting on CGI. I'd rather have a false false false false idea. Kisses to actors and creators! oh, he also loved "production"!
