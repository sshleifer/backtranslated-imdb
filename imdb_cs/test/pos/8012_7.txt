I and my college friends alberto lopez, dave hall, alcock (we graduated from uea in 1997, norwich, uk) we're still meeting and watching b-movies once a month. We are perfect experts in the art of poor filmmaking, and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 horrible / brilliant movies. <br /> <br /> so if you just got beer and weed and need a movie to laugh like a drain, DROID GUNNER aka PHENENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is totally aware that he is in Turkey, where is the film, and milk for everything he can! Matthius Hues is noble in his wooden acting and muscular moron (is that the word ??) as he grunts "But I want 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you like it, check out: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything from Charles Band or Fred Olena Ray ... (but be warned: some of their movies are absolutely and absolutely without merit and you will scream for those lost hours of your life !!!?!).
