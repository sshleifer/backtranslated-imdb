If you want to see what could be classified as a "stage" version of GYPSY, it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you like the (ed) listing of MERMAN GYPSY, then you really enjoy watching MIDLER like Gypsy Mother, ROSE. It is my opinion that Midler has volume, vibrato and represents that Merman once had. It's not often these days, while listening to updated versions of musicals that I get that armor feeling that makes hair on my neck armor, but Bette Midler certainly shows her talent in this movie-how to you like apples ..... <br /> <br /> I know you may not like it, but for me Mrs. Midler is definitive "Gypsy".
