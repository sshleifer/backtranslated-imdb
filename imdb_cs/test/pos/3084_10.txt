Cary Elwes has to say she gives better performance than Costner did in RHPOT, but anyway. I have to say that this film makes me laugh mainly because the actors really look what they do and you just sit there and think what the hell it is, but in a very very good way . Accidental bursts of songs were brilliant and good, and I really liked the used music score. so in your roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 of me defiantly <br /> <br /> 'Unlike other Robin Hoods.I can speak with an English accent'
