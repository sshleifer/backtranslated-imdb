I hope Robert Redford will do other movies like this. Hillerman's books are amazing and, as a small child growing up in the southwest, his stories hit home! Adam Beach is highly undervalued and under used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Many of today's movie visitors want to see movies that come to your mind. I've seen all Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, picturesque and have great land. I hope that if enough Robert Redford writes enough people, he may decide to do a few more! Thank you Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great fun! If anyone gets a chance to read Tony Hillerman's last book like that! That's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop by every point and feel the Hillman book setting. Amazing experience.
