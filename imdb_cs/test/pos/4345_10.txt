This movie is really a classic 80's movie! He has to have 80's in all the films! Weapons, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And stick to the classic 80 "bad guy vs good guy" movie - this movie is about something other than the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson chopping criminals and CREEPS with a heavy Korean War 30 caliber machine gun! HEAVY MACHINE FOR LOUD HEATING! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for a heavy machine gun, he runs back to his crib and takes long guns with a long range! This pistol can stop the freakin ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes in the size of the bullets cartridges into the bad guys with him! And if that's not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank grenade launcher that is only good when it can get into CREEPS. ha "great and much out of the actor's walls (mainly CREEPS) will appear throughout the movie! The movie is loaded with unforgettable steamers and scenes! Damn, my favorite scene / line is where CREEP leader faces Broson in jail and explains to him:" Tell you what I'm gonna do ... I'll kill a little old lady ... just for you! "... catch it for six hours of news". Is this movie violent? Damn yes! But you will laugh and crouch all the way through !!
