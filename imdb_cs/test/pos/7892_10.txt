JOE (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who is known to hate "hippies and her". He meets Bill, a businessman who just murdered his young drug addict, Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill escapes and joins the hippie community on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the lightest parts of the city, where the inner hatred and the hatred of men are tested. Criticism: This was John G. Avildsen's first hit, which became the first hit to turn into laughter (including a stunning run). : 'Rocky', 'Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Bernie's Weekend'). The film is quite interesting in that it served to cast the themes and ideas of the turbulent 1960s (Vietnam War, Black Power, Pound Women, etc.). It also has good performance from Peter Boyl as Joe, one of the cinema's first antiheroes. He was always good at playing haunted, bossy heavies whose abstract thoughts are enforced by his intimidating presence (he would play Frankenstein's monster in Mel Brook's spoof Young Frankenstein). It reminds me of a small child trapped in a big, stupid, awkward body. The film has a weak script (for example, Joe and Bill's meeting is a bit random), but it has a particularly horrifying end to the post-Taxi Driver. QUOTE: Title Song: "I saw a fella who was selling junk to children, every time I go through, she's nervous because she knows if I catch him, I'll kick his head and kick his fat $. "
