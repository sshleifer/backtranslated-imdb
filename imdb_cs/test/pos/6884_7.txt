Yong-ki Jeong's "scary part-puppet master" was the last Korean movie Horror, which pleased me to watch. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this movie struck me immediately when I saw it online reviewed, with pictures that made me think of puppet master, Childs Play and other toys / dolls on horror shocks in the past. But for some reason I didn't think .. "Boy, that will be cheap", I imagined it would be scary and fun. Toysome horror did pretty well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly but I like it so it was fine. The score, almost like I found with Acacia, was beautiful and very reminiscent of the classic horror score of the past. I will not give too much, but the story was strong in this, and I would highly recommend that any fan of Asian HORROR. It's not extreme, it's not the most serious, but it's really good.
