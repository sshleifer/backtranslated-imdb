As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (in terms of the HDI index; human development index). This film unveils our future. Our future would be Norway's future because we are all paddling to achieve the best and offer the least. Life that has been proven to be exaggerated, but comparing today's interests with those of our ancestors is far from reality. Watching this movie without any of our assumptions can find both of our faces; the one who laughs on the brilliant scene of Andreas who throws out his girlfriend, and the one who searches for magazines for hours and hours to choose silly chairs among stupid collections. The idea of ​​a hole with the hope of lightness was another wonderful idea of ​​the movie. Mild Glory; The only one and the effort we have achieved makes us feel closer to Andreas. Although I was most impressed by the idea and production of the film, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played quite well and the film's atmosphere was exactly the same.
