No matter what country you have to buy this show, Sure It's an Australian and if you've ever seen any attempt at our comedy, it's almost sucking, but with the chaser there are no boring men who make bad puns. a team of people who talk about topical issues (largely in Australia) are kidding about our ads, kidding our politicians and so on. The boys also had a 2002 Cnnnn show that wasn't as successful as the war that only started this year, so all it talks about is the latest news that is really good, no matter how boring or tragic it is, they try to throw some funny light on some things.
