SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and provocative film and I could watch Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. Places in the English countryside, beautiful London locations, interiors, elegant wardrobes and of course writing and dialogue have become a thrilling adventure with the SEPARATE LIES. It has been said, and maybe it's just an American point of view, because the British are more sophisticated in the handling of sexual escapades, and I find it hard to watch Tom Wilkinson stand out because his wife Hilariously sets off on a journey in a sexual way that really brings her very little pleasure, creating many Desperate for her husband, with a cadre who is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw the failure of Wilkinson's character - his goal of perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson she should look deeper into her true character and goodness, realizing what she has thrown away. Tom Wilkinson makes SEPARATE LIES into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment and despair on his screen as his wife leaves with another man. And he himself makes his way in SEPARATE LIES by understanding his mistakes, embracing his wife, despite everything that has happened, and leading her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
