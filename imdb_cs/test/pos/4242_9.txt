Chucky (murderous doll from "Kids Games" and 2 miserable sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (with "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get in, SHE is killed and has her soul put in another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet, to make Chucky and Tiffany's real people again ... Much better than that sounds. After the last two sequels of "Children's Play" (both were horrible), I was expecting the worst, but this was a lot of fun. The film is not taken seriously for a second (seriously - how could it?) And the lines and situations are actually quite funny. There are also some very bloody murders that have thrown us away to satisfy horror fans, and the movie never stops moving. The film also has a few things usually not found in the horror movie - Gay's Best Friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and did not play for laughter and the sequence in which Stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. John Ritter has a nice portrait as a sheriff. Acting is good - Stability is young, very pretty and likable; Heigl doesn't have much to do, but he pulls it out and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are happy as murderous dolls. My favorite part is when dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for rubber and he says, "But I'm out of rubber!" The special effects are good (no crazy CGI here) and this is one of the few horror movies that humor and violence mix in a fun way. Worth seeing. I give it 9.
