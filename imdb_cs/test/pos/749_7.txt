I found the film Don't Look In The Basement, which is very good, with some big characters in it. She is a young psychiatric nurse named Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) who starts working at an isolated psychiatric institute. While there he meets with different kinds of different characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who takes care of the asylum after one of the patients kills him with Dr. Stephens. My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old lady, Allison, who is a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee) a young black man who walks all day and seems to be in the game . all your own world. The film was a very low budget movie, but it was still a really great movie. I know it was on 'Video Nasties' list back in the 80s, but he didn't think it had a lot of gore in it, Alothough's got some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED !!!
