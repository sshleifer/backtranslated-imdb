I've never heard of Mishima before I watched this movie, and although its parts are a little boring, I'm still looking at me when I repeat the box. At the beginning of the film, we learned about a famous Japanese writer who acts like a fool and commits public seppuku. As the film progresses, you are gently brought into the twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The phases of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a mixture of two contrasting stories, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appears in black and white. The second story is the adaptation of the scenes from the novel, which are staged as a play and filmed in vivid colors. There is another novel in each chapter. Between each chapter, the story goes back to the present, as Mishima progresses to his potential ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension are kept to the end. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many people will regard this film as a boring conceited and artistic house. I respect that this is not a movie for people who want action and a strong story. On the other hand, if you are a person who enjoys the opportunity to penetrate the mind of a bizarre man and watch his life story in the collage of beautiful images Philip Glass has brought to music, you will love it. I loved it. <br /> <br />
