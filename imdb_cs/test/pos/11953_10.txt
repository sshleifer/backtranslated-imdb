I really love everything Savage Steve Holland has done, the writer / director of this great movie. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I Got Into College". Great! In any case, this movie is really funny and brings unexpected things. Where else, but in this movie can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for some old-fashioned slapstick comedy (George with a turtle raft), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (a Christmas tree on the roof of a car). This movie keeps throwing you unexpected things even after you've seen it 100 times like me! Enjoy!
