I'm a new convert you could say. I borrowed a DVD from a local library. I was interested in the samurai because I was watching the "Last Samurai". My father told me he was looking at Shintar when he was a child. He said it was pretty good. We're on line 3. I love it. It takes a little bit of getting used to dubbed English voices over Japanese-speaking characters, but I really enjoy it. It's a little strange to watch tiny pauses when ninja stars are thrown on characters and hold onto a tree or wall. I wasn't used to that, but now I'm. But I suppose it's the technology they had in the 1960s. I have noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, is very humble, will not notice too much of the time (he only says he is better than the ninja of the enemy). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It's really interesting to watch the fencing that Koichi Ose has. That's amazing. This series is for anyone interested in samurai.
