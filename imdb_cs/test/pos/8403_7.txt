When I saw Gone with the wind, I thought there would be no better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he's fantastic. This is a movie I could watch a thousand times and wouldn't bore me.
