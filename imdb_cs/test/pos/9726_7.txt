He had no idea what I was going to experience while watching this old 1940 movie. However, I always enjoy Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer), who plays the role of younger sister Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and also their mother, Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer) . I thought I'd be bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who was too protective of her daughters until they met Robert Cummings, (Ridley Crane), who has a playboy millionaire reputation for having a lot of gals and a heavy drinker who keeps on party. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and continues to bombard his mind and just can't drive his car. It's at the moment in the movie when it becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this movie, which will definitely keep your attention right at the very end of the movie.
