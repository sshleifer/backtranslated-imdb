Not for those adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie, looking after the war, a mental problem, from a different perspective. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. Everything goes to the problem of dealing with the past, with <br /> <br /> Emilion Estevez's character doesn't seem to be concerned, and Martin Sheen's character doesn't want to deal. The protective mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart, but with the idea closed for obvious reasons.
