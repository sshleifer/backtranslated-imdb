The title search for Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is one movie missing from the list you saw. One of the 4 films that Scott produced in RKO during his premiere (1947) is easy for others. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder-keg about to explode among trail-riders who drive longhorns into Trail Street, the city's main street, and sod-busters who feed our belly. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to stand between the two groups and bring the city in order. More I'm not going to say except that Scott movies usually have only one pretty girl and this has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played a man you could watch for your sense of honor, courage, equality and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to Scott with the certainty that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN teammates in this movie, plays a good guy to change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many world war actors who played in American movies. How sad we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes killed in Munich in 1972 and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives its moral compass from too much cocaine and too much determination to go crazy. I wonder how it all plays in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal, after all, wasn't a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
