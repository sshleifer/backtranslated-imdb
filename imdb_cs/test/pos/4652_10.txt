Cheerful, clean, light and sensitive. What else can you want in the movie? This is my favorite number one movie. Since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of having a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. Character clichés in ridiculous situations make this movie so much fun. The wonderful comedy chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up most of my favorite parts of the movie. And who doesn't love the hopeless clutter of Flynch? Don't forget the airport that has León's friends, dressed as Hari Krishnas: dancing, singing and playing a tambourine - unbeatable! Keys are a genius, places are classic and the story is timeless. <br /> <br /> The word wisely, if you haven't seen this movie when you were little, it probably won't win a place in your heart today. But still give him a chance, you can find out that "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
