This is an excellent, little known film. Tom Selleck does an excellent job in this film, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I would like to find out if this movie has appeared on DVD yet, but there are some points that have been clearly removed. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) clearly cut some parts. It would be interesting to see more Japan in the movie. Baseball sequences are far and most realistic from any baseball movie, I'm sure most actors were a current or former baseball player. I love taping this film at least once a year. The best scenes include a lack of hat tipping after Tom gets beaned in a big game, and an intensely sensual scene of Tom with a Hiroku hot tub. Dennis Haysbert is also doing a great job, it is good to see that he has finally gained some recognition, not only in baseball films (he was also in Major League).
