This is a good family movie with a few laughs. I wish she didn't have too many school things like a tyrant in it to fill the film up. Also, it seems too easy to save the site before construction. I mean, it just went too easily. It makes you aware of wildlife. He had a cute way to introduce the land that a fast runner but a little too slow for me. I liked it a bit and reminded me of going back to school. The DVD is full of villi, so don't miss it. 7 out of 10 for 10 out of 10 DVDs with add-ons worth watching. Well worth seeing!
