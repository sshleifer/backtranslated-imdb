Ernesto is the man who makes life from stomping other solid citizens their hard earned money. Together with Mance, an older man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent life, but that doesn't make him rich. Enter Federico, an older man who has more experience in the art of fraud. Together with the younger Ernesto, they proved to be a winning combination. It only lasts until Pilar, Federica's former love interest, appears in the picture. This Spanish film by Miguel Bardem is a light tone and a pleasant fit. More, better made carp films have been made with much smarter plot than this one, but the movie is easy to accept and sometimes has plenty of fun situations. <br /> <br /> This spectator will see Federico Luppi in something, even reading the phone book! He's an actor actor. We had the honor of seeing him in the Buenos Aires stage, where they did a great job before their international film career. As Federico does what he does best. It is not possible to imagine someone better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun when she engages with these men. Veteran actor Miguel Alexandre is also good as Manco.
