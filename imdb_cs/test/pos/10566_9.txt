The BBC is a 3 hour adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in London's Dickensian. Dark deeds lead to scornful dilemmas.Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" provide fantastic performances like leading ladies who ask this question ... ANY OTHER ... while Rupert Evans shines like a wonderfully bad "gentleman". support from Imelda Staunton's "Mrs. Sucksby", David Troughton's "Mr. Ibbs" and Charles Dance's "Uncle". The plot revolves and turns, and I wasn't sure if I could be led to care for characters who could hurt themselves and use each other ... but somehow ... and that's for the quality of the show. Love feels like love .. Hate feels like hate ... Betrayal ... Confusion ... Hopefully you will get an idea and hopefully get a DVD and enjoy it (Elaine Cassidy is great) actually .... I have to say I'm in my fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
