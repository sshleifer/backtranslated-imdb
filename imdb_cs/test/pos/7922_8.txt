(Warning: Spoilers! - although it's hard to spoil this movie by telling the story's details.) Eisenstein's black and white propaganda isn't for everyone. It's very old and it's impossible. What is great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but updated soundtrack. Even better, the orchestral version of Prokofiev has created (my favorite performances are Fritz Reiner and Chicago Symphony). The movie is actually funny. It resembles an old "Midsummer Night's Dream". Some outdoor scenes are beautiful. Some actors are also magnificent. (An actor who played Nevsky could be a superstar today. Ditto for a warrior, Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) <br /> <br /> This can be the best collection in the world, on film, from Russian Russian statements (There are tons of them - most of the spoken lines). The battle scenes really look much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flixes. These guys are so clumsy that their fights will be real peasants. The weapons look ugly, so the actors probably tried to avoid hurting each other. In fact, the actor playing in the German "grand marshall" is very hard to find scary early movies. it looks like he was really a pussy. After being captured, he looks * pathetic. (Talking about the intended audience, d?) <br /> <br /> The really funny touch is that the German army brings with it * the organ * played by a black robe character. Watch the Russians bring this guy * while * playing. After the battle is over and almost all Germans are dead, the best part of the film (and music) is coming, a song sung to dead soldiers who died defending the country. This part is so sad that it's almost an anti-war statement. Ten times as many ladies as ladies rated this movie. Wonder why? Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic - killed more Russians than anyone else. "Those who come to Russia and carry a sword will die by the sword."
