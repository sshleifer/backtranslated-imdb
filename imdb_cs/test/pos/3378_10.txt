I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams for the show was worthy of Emmy. It was miraculous how well he did it. And be as fast and as random and creative as Robin Williams really ... WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say about 20 fast fire lines and make 15 different characters while providing these lines, all while the sounds as well as ROBIN WILLIAMS do these characters ..... well that my friends are impressive acting. His one thing is to make Robin Williams impersonate in a few minutes. It's another thing to do for a whole TV movie. I don't know how I felt about the show, and I don't know how much they played with the facts, but I know Chris Diamantopoulos was watching me. So I give it to HIM 10.
