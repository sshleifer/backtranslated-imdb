This movie I really enjoyed what it is: Funny little movie that is not taken too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere, so I won't go into details. Michael is not about a complicated plot. It just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful trip. Performance by John Travolta as a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-beating, pie-eating angel is just perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? Watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a good time overall. Highly recommended.
