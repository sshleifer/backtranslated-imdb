The first Dead End Kids movies (before they were re-christened "The Bowery Boys") were very fun and well-made Warner Brothers movies. Despite being rather formative, they still had excellent writing, acting, and over time. Don't confuse them with the cheap Bowery Boys movies from Monogram Pictures - despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey, these films have been several times below the quality line of earlier films. The film begins with a tough kid, John Garfield, who won a lightweight boxing championship. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards, he is on a drunken bout and is blamed for a murder he didn't really commit. The problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn't sure he didn't kill the man, so he runs and lives hobo. Eventually, he meets the feisty May Robson and Dead End Kids - just as the lady you just know becomes his girlfriend the time. Where the rest of the movie wasn't all Surprising, but given the quality of the movie, it doesn't seem to matter. Garfield and the kids are at their best, and it's a movie that will certainly please all but the most interesting viewers.
