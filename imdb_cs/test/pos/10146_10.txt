Some people say that the pace of this movie is a bit slow, but how is it different from other Hitchcock movies? They all move very deliberately, and as a point they have a stimulated tension and brilliant mounts. This film gives us the right amount of comic relief that makes the tense scenes seem more exciting. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema, which exists in Hitchcock's collection (preferably probably almost all of the "back window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant that a series of usually small pieces of film fits into a dialogue without dialogue to tell the story visually. This is, of course, the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter stair sequence at the end of the image. Hitchcock is not a lot of slip here and acting is excellent especially with Doris Day in a somewhat surprisingly serious role.
