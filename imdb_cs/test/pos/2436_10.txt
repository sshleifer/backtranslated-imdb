He almost missed it. When visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980s, I went through the channels after everyone else went to sleep. It wasn't just Bogart, he was obsessed; but rather the whole time of those old movies that those of my age know so well. Add to this a plot similar to the Maltese Falcon - where Sacchi has so many different characters - and you have a piece of art to me. Ten years later he appeared on TV and recorded it. >
