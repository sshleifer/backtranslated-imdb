Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. We see her late at the beginning of the film. When her older mother protests, Erika goes into madness, attacking an older woman without regret. Erika, as it turns out, is a music teacher with a reputation in the conservatory where she teaches. The next time we see her, she is a model of serenity, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels she is wasting her time and her. The same is true of Anna, the talented girl Erika hates, perhaps because she promises in the young woman that she is unwilling to support her. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, we watch Erik go to the entertainment area and continue to one of the cabins where pornographic material is displayed. Erika is transfixed as she watches things being done on the screen. On another occasion, Erika arrives at the drive-in where the film takes place. Her attention is directed to a parked car in which two lovers make sex. The camera stays on Eric when she is lost in dreaming and watches what the two lovers are doing until the young man inside her car surprises her. Erika flees scaryly that she was discovered. When a wealthy couple invites Eric to perform in a recital in their rich home, she meets an eager young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's play; the young man himself is a talented pianist. His eagerness to compliment Erik meets skepticism on her part. Walter decided to audition for the Erika championship and is accepted. Thus begins Walter's persecution of Erika, who is taken aback by realizing what the young man's motives really are. On the other hand, Erik, she starts to fantasize about Walter's ways that only her mind could imagine, what she would want her to do when, and if they joined. Walter turns off with a letter Erika wrote to him, detailing the sexual acts that are disgusting to the young man. The end of the film reminded us of Mr. Haneke's recent sequence of the current "Cache". We are taken to a concert hall where Erika will be held. You can see the lobby coming through and looking for the arrival of Walter, who goes to the hall without noticing. Erika's expression to the camera reveals much more of her mind state in the last minutes of the movie. When she flees the hall after she wounds herself, the camera leaves her and focuses on the building's fa√ßade, which seems to be on the screen for a long time. "La Pianiste" is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This beautiful on-screen actress performs on one of her finest scenes, led by Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Mrs. Huppert works with economic gestures, yet she develops as much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. The Support Corps does wonders under the direction of the director. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. It seems to be the key to what went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtlety in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast as Walter. This young actor does a great job in the film as a young man, so in love with a woman who is obsessed with demons that he will never be able to chase away or make her normally love him. Michael Haneke's movies are always disturbing to watch, but they offer so many rewards because they dare to go where other men don't. The great music you hear in the film is mainly composers Schubert and Schumann. The film is tremendously supported by Christian Berger's cinematography.
