I found it an underrated, quietly impressive Spaghetti Western (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite a modest commission (in addition to co-author Albert Producer, the only significant crew member is composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (novice Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero). while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan lend mythical quality to the proceedings, as well as an unusual plot (including a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering the strategic cleaning of the city, and a law that finally has a protracted law). shooter against a horde of Mexican bandits. There are several hard action scenes at hand? the film is limited by the amazing climax in which the star trio is surrounded by a flaming cabin? plus a few outrageous moments that are like the Western Spaghetti Western mark: from the center of the street, Cord sees a hidden shooter at the window, reflected in a whiskey bottle; The man who helps Cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli will also make a nice impression as a country girl with whom Cord Cordons is; supportive cast, then, is dotted with familiar (if very anonymous) faces? all basically genre accessories. <br /> <br /> I wasn't aware that the English version of the MGM / UA R1 DVD DVD was cut out: I was confused by the poor running time listed on the back cover; the movie was only 99 minutes long and not 118 ?? Apparently the character of Cordova is killed in a longer Italian version!
