"The Couch Trip" is one of those stupid comedies that set off in the 1980s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a psychiatrist who is a psychiatrist and goes to Beverly Hills to Charles Grodin. Most of the film's humor is based on their satirical view of Beverly Hills and the empty lives of the people (the woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you're watching for a good time. Don't expect any religious experience. But most likely you will laugh as the people of Beverly Hills boast about their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson ("UHF").
