It was a nice musical about creating a Moulin Rouge ballroom. In many ways, it reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the '40s and' 50s, in that it has many clich√©s that led to the inevitable conclusion ("will the show continue?"). While, of course, none of this is new, it was nice and well done. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful. In many ways, it reminds me of the more seductive version of GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite a player but this was disinfected in American film. But in FRENCH CANCAN, characters are fully functional libidos - but nothing really is shown, so the movie is fine for kids. Nothing new but well done.
