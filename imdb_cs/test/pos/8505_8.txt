I first saw it when it was first mentioned, so I'm not too objective. I managed to scare it, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of the entire video footage of the imitated story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadow itself). And the cast was so real. I hardly know Shane Briant of anything else, so it might not be so good to call HIM "well-occupied", but for me it's Dorian Gray. And as for the other male actors, the one who suited him so well was Nigel Davenport (who is as good at "bigger than life" characters) as Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a sort of "repertoire player" Dan Curtis at the time, because of the dark shadows. As one poster points out, this version can include engagement with men in a rather subtle way. The scene where Dorian recites a list of men's names for John Karl's character as a way to blackmail him and look at Karlen's face was very well done. (If the scene was done now, it would probably be done in TOO OBVIOUS in a way and it would be wrong in comparison.) I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was hardly a name for me, let alone more, so more than just a famous version 1945 (which is rightly famous), this is the version for me.
