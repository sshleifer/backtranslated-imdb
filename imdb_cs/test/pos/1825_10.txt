Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I'd say it's definitely the best of the 80s teen-sex-comedy, but that's a back-handed compliment. That's a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place - almost twenty years later it is an amazing picture - but its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus death!) Nicolas Cage is amazing, showing all the premature promises that he turned out to be wasted on a crowded event. Deborah Foreman is a revelation of this film and I can't believe she didn't go to a bigger career; someone reappears her QUICK. This is sweeter and softer than most movies of this genre - the necessary nudity seems to be due to a contractual obligation - and although it is not breakthrough, it is certainly nice to see this kind of film that respects its characters and does not crucify its shallow young girls for fun - even Foreman's crew the best friends who are being put under the pressure of peers are never presented as villains. (Indeed, her friend Stacy, forced to double with Cage's friend Fred, has a good time despite her protests and sets off with Fred in the back seat). nowadays he is holding quite well. Warning for those who are unfamiliar with the film: do not watch one of his seemingly continuous exhibitions of VH1 - go rent it in your untidy glory. Otherwise, you lack some of the most effective, time-specific dialogs. And Valley Girl can't be written and not mention the faba soundtrack of the great 80s - most of them are miracles that are not only an integral part of time and place in this movie, but thematically well chosen. You see it - amazing little flick! Fer shur !!
