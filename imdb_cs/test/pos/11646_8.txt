Matthew Poncelet was not a real man, but a character combination of two murderers who were convicted of BOTH and sentenced to death for the murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read User Comments and responded as if Matthew were real. The character is based on a mixture of two murderers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on one Willie committed. The conflict of both Willie and someone else present, both sides, swear that the other party has been impressed by the story. Prejean's approach is unique in not only serving convicts, waiting for death and helping them to take responsibility for their actions, they also turn to the families of the victims to help them know that the convict really felt sorry over what effectively helped both sides. It seems that everyone who sends here has a strong belief in the Deadly Sentence. It is not my place to say that it is the right or wrong theory that punishes death with death, is some kind of karmic sense, but denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days, though expensive, makes more sense to be imprisoned in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise) for the rest of their days to remind of the cruel thing they seemed to be a more appropriate punishment - they are technically alive but deny life. Say somebody killed someone to get out of the responsibility of the person they killed (like Susan Smith killed her poor children by shoving her car into the lake). I find it rather ironic that they would not get the "freedom" they wanted, and now they would have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned. Prejean's story goes through the story very well. She has my respect - she can find her balance - she does not support the killer, she leads them to accept what they do. If they did not feel any sort of remorse, they would not be asked for spiritual guidance. Last comment, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parents for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered, mumbles something about why he apologized for her death. I think it was that Poncelet denies that he kills both children throughout the film. There is doubt in Prejean's mind that they both murdered - there is a friend who was condemned but not to death - my idea is that Poncelet killed Delacroix's boy and the other man murdered the girl - since Poncelet took responsibility for what he did. If he was responsible for the girl's death, he would probably also apologize for it.
