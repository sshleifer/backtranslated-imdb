This movie fired me. I thought I knew a little about the ruins of Attica. After this I saw that I knew nothing. The story is told through a relationship between a lawyer and a black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men, and the dramatic drama that was developing, were stunning. The flashback sequences in prison were amazing. It's hard to believe it wasn't a documentary shot that was so real. It wasn't just a big piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I'll give it two inches up.
