Short subject RKO. A group of noisy little bullying gets a lesson in the crooner tolerance Frank Sinatra, who compares America to the house I live in. This little film brings a relevant message about the evil of prejudice and bias. Sinatra is the absolute natural in front of the camera; intense and honest, he is the perfect spokesman for the values ​​he holds here. Sinatra sings "The House I Live In" by Lewis Allan & Earl Robinson. This subtle melody, with a solid, pro-American message, is something of a comeback since the horrific events of September 11, 2001. After Pearl Harbor, Hollywood went to war completely against the Axis. Not only did many of the stars come together, or do homework at the front, but the output of the Studies was largely turned into a war effort. Of course, Newsreels brought the latest war news to the neighboring theater every week. Features have shown battle stories or topics related to war. Even short objects and cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda, enhancing morale or disseminating information. Together, Uncle Sam, the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unrivaled combination.
