Years ago, I didn't love and respect Jimmy Cagney's films almost as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films they made with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. The more I watched these films, the more I found myself addicted to these aspects. In fact, I am now kind of and I expect them! Fans of old Hollywood movies probably understand what I'm saying - teens and other teenagers don't! Well, when it comes to entertainment, the owner of HELL will never stop from start to finish. The idea of ​​a shadowy character played by Cagney, who takes over the leadership of a reform school, is ridiculous, and although all the changes he made seemed appealing, it all worked out and provided solid entertainment. The gang of hard criminals was pre-Dead End Kids and they play similar roles to Frankie Darrow and Farina instead of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in our gang comedy and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood. All he needed to give up was named a fruitless name and acted as a pretty stereotypical "black man". He was actually quite good here, and the usual black stereotypes are somewhat subdued than usual. However, some will crouch on a very funny but terribly offensive court scene involving Farina and his father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", don't say I didn't warn you. <br /> <br /> In addition to this small complaint and conspiracy that is hard to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. Children do a great job, just like Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as an evil overseer. Also, as an added plus, you get to see perennial Warner stock actor Allen Jenkins in his first role for the studio.
