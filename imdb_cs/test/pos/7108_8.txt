"House of Dracula" is a good sequel to "House of Frankenstein". It's not so much action, but acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is a benevolent doctor who gets sick after receiving blood from Dracula through transfusion (Dracula was actually receiving a transfusion to overcome his "suffering" but he puts a spell on a hunchback sister and then transfuses his blood into a doctor.). It turns out that Dracula really didn't come looking for a cure, but instead drained the blood of a beautiful sister. Dracula is destroyed and the wolf man is next in line for the drug (which is successful). Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster has been discovered and revived shortly before being burned to death (don't worry, the same trio has returned to "Abbott and Costello met Frankenstein"). John Carradine is once again playing the sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his alias at the beginning of the film and at the "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is a likable Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as a Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill once again plays an inspector who often does in Universal Studios monster movies. Breeder for your collection.
