Mr. Bean was great fun, I loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking guy and his facial expressions were merry !!! The series was so successful that in 1997 they even shot Mr. Bean's movie, which, by the way, was also funny! It's funny to see all the adventures and situations he gets, this series was definitely a classic and from time to time I still watch the episode. Mr. Bean is well worth 10/10 in my book, comedy offbeat fans need to check it out.
