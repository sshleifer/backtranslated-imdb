This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh. It's a goal. No, I think it's ... yes, it's ... BOOB! This movie is all the more fun as Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his last battle scene. This movie is velly vely seekwet like treasha! Congratulations if you buy or rent it. In my opinion, you will never return. I haven't found him in the store since. I once watched this movie and fell in love with the action moves of Kung Fu forever. If you're looking for an amazing movie of great production value, good or even average gaming and good special effects ... that's not the movie. If you're looking for laughter and a timeless miracle, pick it for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. It's a perfect evening with friends, popcorn and drinks.
