I honestly don't know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute faves. The fight with the tiger and his men shook, fighting with the pirates with the axes swinging, the whole parody with everyone trying to avoid each other in the house is purely brilliant ... ok, so it did not have the necessary kick butt of the last confrontation, but the manchus was pretty good. I give it 8/10.
