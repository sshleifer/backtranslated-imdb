It's a superbly created thriller in Washington, which is driven by talented Wolfgang Petersen with screenwriter Jeff Maguire, who has done very little over the years, so he may take care of his roses. Clint Eastwood is an agent for aging secret services and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin against himself in a massive test of wills and ingenuity where the president's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition among competing security agencies makes it harder for the president, an authentic touch. This movie was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were on top. Probably Eastwood never did a better job than here, and it's so easy for an old professional. There are some amazing sound effects huffing him and inflating when he runs next to the president's car as a bodyguard for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else has noticed the humor of those sounds that have been added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this film more than I did, but then bodyguard movies are his thing. Rene Russo was the perfect choice for an Eastwood agent because she's so unprecedented, but so talented and shining. The tension is strained every inch of the way in this story, and the psychological struggles of Eastwood to redeem from earlier protection failures are beautifully demonstrated by its typical behavior. With Eastwood, if he raises his eyebrows a millimeter, watch out! Of course he's a super-cool champion. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge in the paranoid character he portrays all the horror he wishes and capture the central male vanity of perfection. What is good.
