I recently read the story to see how these two matches will come together, and if you believe it, this film improves on Balzac. I think the story moves to come back to the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered a lot and yet returns home, not a hero, but a pariah. As someone mentioned, I was initially confused if Chabert was similar to Martin Guerre's return. No. It is fixed by Balzac that Chabert is a real business. What is interesting, though, is that it is he, but how his wife and society treat him. I think it's the timeless story of the men fighting for theirs and leaving them behind when they come home. Chabert is a tragic character who has been all the more amazing that amazing Gerard Depardieu. I'm not interested in being charming in 1 million movies. Fanny Ardant is horrible in character. Once the prostitute, Rose used her female wiles to climb the ladder. Are her emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are, and maybe even pair with, their social status at the time, and you will begin to feel empathy with it. Fabrice Lucini is slowly moving into my heart. It's as special as Derville. I think if you manage to get this movie gem you won't regret it. French cinema at its best.
