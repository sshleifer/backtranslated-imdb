Forget Easy Rider - Head is a film about the sixties. Nearly Laughing: Monkees will cut his entire career to one minute of dandruff television advertising! You see: 50 feet Victor Mature trying to find out what the hell he was doing in this movie! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his cow on a leash) tell Davey Jones: "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band plays the honest punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: Davey Jones sings Harry Nielsen's song about a transsexual father! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual allusions about her in her film debut! Witness: vain protests against the Vietnam War jump from nothing and disappear just as fast! Watch: Mike Nesmith Spit At Christmas While Wearing A Velvet Victorian Jacket Smoking In A Web Gothic Horror-Movie Sound-Stage! Let yourself be drifting: into karmic bliss inspired by the comic version of Indian mysticism presented by a shamanic black actor while Peter Tork pretends to know how to play guitar! Discover: Oscar directed by Bob Rafelson is the first feature film written by Jack Award actor Nicholson! Pretend it doesn't happen: when the Monkees commit suicide in a group by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take the Drugs - Take a Lot of Drugs: Take as many medicines as they have taken and the crew apparently did the movie! With his head, the Monkees proved to be the dumbest, prettiest entertainers in Hollywood history, no bar. It's amazing to find that they're blaming the failure of this movie on a bad promo. Sure, the promotion was virtually non-existent; but they did not know how angry, how downward depressing, how is this film destructive?! This film is a trip - to the bad acid - to the suicide department of the psychiatric hospital. The only film I know is depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; and like Brazil, this film shows why life in the later 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It is not just that Western culture has suffered from a serious overload of information, but the information itself was only bad, bad, bad and desperate. In fact, it was the overload effect that kept people running because it allowed people to distract themselves with one crisis or another - if the Vietnam news wasn't enough, they could turn the channel and watch the documentary about rising. unemployment rate. "Positive" Response to the Reality Revealed in the Head Was Woodstock - Three Days of Peace and Love and Nudity and Mud and Beetles and Bad Food and Dirty Drink and Poop and Pee and Bad Acids and Peter Townsend Almost Killed Abbie Hoffman. Everything takes place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly attentive eyes of a real NY State Troopers army - which means that Woodstock Nation's "freedom" was just as illusory as John Sebastion thought he was singing while he barely managed to. speak. "500,000 assholes are too stupid to get out of the rain," said one Woodstock critic (I think it was Andy Warhol). One good thing that happened was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years earlier, Jimi Hendrix's experience went on their first national tour of America, as the opening group of the opening for - Monkees. You see, it's somehow connected. You owe it to yourself - no, you owe it to your unborn children - to see the true sixties just to find the film in this bizarre, miraculous and utterly absurd homage to one of the most interesting capitalist scams of the later 20 century.
