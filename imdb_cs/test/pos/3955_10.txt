I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan where he drew a huge crowd and a little intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The event is frightening and the mood of loneliness that movie projects are amazing. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then rode a skateboard through all the striking lights of the city. You really feel that guy. I've never heard of actors, but I liked all three. I think they did a great job on their way to self-discovery. All in all, it is an amazingly cool and exciting thrilling movie. I still have many images in my mind.
