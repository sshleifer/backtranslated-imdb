I would say, "the only film that concerned club / dj / electronic music and rave ... what worships respect". <br /> <br /> Really now. It is a wonderfully fun, fast-paced and fairly accurate display of night raver. Though, his in the club, his in Wales and his somewhat old. The film leaves some of the more sketchy elements of club life, but does not completely disconnect from them. It represents an idyllic but at the same time a serious image of the ups and downs of the characters. <br /> <br /> At the core of the film and the best feature of Justin Kerrigan's script, the characters are eccentric, unique, yet absolutely perfect. understandable and accessible. This simple movie wouldn't work and would be infinitely less fun if it wasn't Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of human traffic as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabes, important hangers in British youth culture around the 1990s, BUT ... cannot deny that they are engaging characters. It's crazy, its brutally honest, it's sober, it's on top, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Raves are a complicated thing, so they are the drugs that are taken at these events, so are the people you meet. But someone who went to parties became tired and still walked ... Human traffic is the best moment to take on a subculture. No matter what you do, avoid "Groove" as opposed to everything that is good about human traffic.
