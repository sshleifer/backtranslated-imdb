I found the story that was just enough of a thriller that beautiful music did not disappoint henry mancici. Julie Andrews was excellent and I certainly do not understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes you happy at the end that everyone is singing. and i love happy sometimes after the end that i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
