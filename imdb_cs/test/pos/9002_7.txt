Now, before people begin to collapse about this movie (those who play rugby anyway) this is a movie! It has been given Hollywood treatments to entertain people, and therefore those who play rugby (myself) are naturally going to pick holes in the choreography of the game in the film. Overall, it is a decent film and brings to mind the morale and thoughts that are worth rugby. The film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work that helps children in the right direction. Towards better people in the future, and is also based on real people who have played for the Highlands team. It is just a typical sports movie with a character who is misleading and eventually finds the way on the right track again through the rugby medium. It is generally a good feeling for a movie that is enjoyable but has drawbacks when it comes to displaying the game. however, as I said, it is a film under Hollywood treatment.
