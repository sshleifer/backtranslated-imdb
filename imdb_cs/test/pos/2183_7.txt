After a few years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart movie, "Two Against the World", it abruptly emerged as a TCM offering under the title "One Deadly Hour", the first national film from 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, \ t a station whose program set loses the listener. Owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass) is a poor executive manager who calls the shots at the station but hides behind his decision by stopping them on Scott. Income, Reynolds has the idea to revive a twenty year old murder case, and offer it as a fifteen chapter radio play. Scott gets help from Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) write the game and introduce it in the air. The Pembroke Murder case concerned a woman who was acquitted of her husband's murder, circumstances not cleared. However, Gloria Pembroke married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to marry (no less as the radio game is to reveal identity of Gloria Pembroke). Martha and Jim Carstairs are about to face the devastating effects of this revelation and embark on a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, Edith's future laws respond by demanding that marriage does not take place. Edith Carstairs confronts the principles of the radio station, vigorously challenging Scott and the rough Reynolds. While Scott accepts his share of the blame for the result, he partly redeems himself by leaving his job, firing his secretary and pulling her out of the office, recognizing it as the conscience he once had. With an unexpected result, the film leaves one as disoriented and dissatisfied as any film that does not end up happy. With about a dozen films under the belt, Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to be here the focus with interesting results. With no names supporting the player, Bogey rises to the opportunity by taking charge in the radio office boundaries, and runs the show as if it were his own. In an interesting piece of characterization he expresses his irritation by running his hands over his bowed head and predicting a half-dozen years of similar effect to what we will see in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans, this is a real treat for capturing unexpected nuances.
