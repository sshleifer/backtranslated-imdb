Deep Blood ... It's one of those movies you're going on here, and you're not saying it would be another Italian jeans! Well, Deep Blood is far away. It's cheap as filmmaking can get and on the other hand it's also creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen or flocked about everyone using fake sharks, well in Joe D'Amato's new approach using all the footage for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons I love Deep Blood so much because it didn't use footage. In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian ghost terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, Joe D'Amato's Deep Blood in Shark Classic. Older Indian elders seem to have once warned a group of young people about this great evil in the sea, and a few years later friends were faced with fears that one of them was killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coast . It only depends on the remaining pairs to make sure that this monster is killed, even if it means to go to the sea to do it. Joe D'Amato Director and producer of this film under his company Filmirage. Published in 1989 and later used in the brutal jaws of Bruno Mattei: Jaws 5, along with many other shark films. Joe D'Amato's Shark Entry is a great movie and every Joe D'Amato fan who has watched the shark movie should try it.
