For those of you who like stand-up comics, you have to hear about George Carlin. He's really one of the best comics alive, so you have to know him. But he has already died, God is resting on him. Or hell. He didn't believe too many religions, so he could also choose hell to live forever. HAHA, just a joke, don't take it seriously! It's bad for you! It's one of George Carlin's latest work, before his death - <br /> <br /> I believe one of his best works, a necessity for every fan almost the best of all George Carlin jokes. It's not the best ... but it's really fun. It has less political and religious jokes. It's just a great time! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. It is not a concert, so it should not have a quick exchange of shots ... slow fading for the next shot was well done. Fading is the best choice for editing!
