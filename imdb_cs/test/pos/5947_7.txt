Fans of Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will surely delight in this farce that won one César and was nominated for four more. Jean Dujardin is an OSS 117 agent, a man who wouldn't know the clue when he hit him upside down. It is also a reflection of the colonial attitude that bears witness to the West. All Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim militants around him are just as stupid, but there is Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and Princess (Aure Atika) to make things interesting. OSS 117 is a miraculous ability to pick up languages, play musical instruments for the first time when it is picked, and sing like a native is all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but is still stupid.
