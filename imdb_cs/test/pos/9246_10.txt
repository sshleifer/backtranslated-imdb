There is a limited number of fans for movies in the world that would like a special genre to go into the depths that this crew did to bring to life something that the original film writer had, up to this point, never achieved. . It is an amazing exploration of the true devotion and love that needs to be achieved in a potentially very successful cult film. Originally, with a blessing from Alex Cox, this crew has begun producing a sequel to one of his films in a totally true punk fashion. Their goal is only to fully capture the atmosphere, as it should be for a complete tribute to the original film "Repo Man". This is a great story about devotion and betrayal that can appear along the way to a wonderful movie. A truly entertaining story and a guaranteed learning experience for the viewer.
