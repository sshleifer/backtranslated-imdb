The "Four Daughters" begins as another "Little Women" clone of the melodrama. The father himself, with four musically talented competent daughters, is busy trying to keep them in line with their rituals. The film revolves around the sudden discovery of a new Hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean shone on the big screen. Ever since the dark, premonition character of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appeared at Ann Lemp's Gate (Priscilla Lane), which was spraying his self-regret and doomed philosophy for the rest of the cast, the "Four Daughters" are much more than just a cub Flick. Although Garfield is the main reason to watch "Four Daughters", there are other flashes of brilliance. Hungarian director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for such gems as "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce," warns his camera of certain images (with the help of cinematographer Ernest Haller from the fame of "Rebel Without A Cause"), which holds in the mind of the audience, for example screeching gate that Ann is the first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), swings so cheerfully becomes a symbol of the exchange of moods and moods of those who use it. That Garfield brings a standout performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast keeps with him most of the way. Unappreciated Jeffrey Lynn plays his part to perfection because of a neglected suitor whose love for his revered Ann never fails even when he is with another man. Claude Rains, somewhat mistaken as the father of four young women, comes with a subtle image of the file on her head, which is lost in random order. Known for their musical abilities, the three sisters Lane Sisters turn into perfect actresses. Vor's supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Maya Robson, and Eddie Acuff, make it all believable. <br /> <br /> As opposed to it, it is part of the trick to touch the viewer's imagination. Ann is an eternal optimist, though they are down and out with Mickey. She always looks at the bright side, and just as much caught in the grip of the Great Depression in those days she saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey recites the whole list of bad things that happened to him when he was looking for a company in his Ann suffering that Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to go out with a thunderbolt that hits him dead when he attacks the corner of life. Mickey has modest talent as a composer; Ann has a talent as a singer and musician. Ann is great about beauty; Mickey is great about personality in a crooked sense. And the differences go on and on. The way everything is reconciled is an important part of the film, we shouldn't miss it. See "Four Daughters" for John Garfield's Doozy on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later when he again fascinated film visitors with one of the biggest movie shows ever, like Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Rings Twice," opposite the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also watch "Four Daughters" to catch important elements that can be skipped if there is too much focus on the star show.
