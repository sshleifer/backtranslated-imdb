When I was a kid, I remembered this show, but I thought the show could be a little old now as an adult. Well, yes, that's what makes the show more retro (and very funky music). This show is mostly well written. I think it's a pleasure that this show was canceled after one season, especially when the show was more popular than the Incredible Hulk. I think fans should ignore bad special effects and enjoy stories. This next sentence includes spoilers: My favorite episode as a child was when there were two Spiderman that the battle against an intriguingly similar idea was invented in the Spiderman 3 movie. I liked the ideas in this TV show that some hate. I believe Stan Lee wasn't a fan.
