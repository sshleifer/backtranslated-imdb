The pace of the film is slow in the works, but if you can tune to its tiny speed and lengthy silence, then it is a satisfying piece of courtly intrigue. The story of the first Emperor of China, his childhood pet and the personal expense of power. The film is a very atmospheric, extremely polite and courteous court ceremony and ritual in contrast to sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cool spaces. The battle scenes are rare and short, with the emphasis being placed on the battle within the individual for what is right to do and whether these goals justify the means. The Emperor's journey from an idealistic peacemaker to a ruthless tyrant aims to be subtle, but gives little background or persuasive insight into the Emperor's motivation, his actions and goals are in fact virtually unchanged; The most interesting performances are Gong Li and the titular Assassin, who reconsider when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China, the Emperor and Assassin, does not rely on hysterical emotions or big battles, but rather on the tense atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to hear that it is just as beautifully beautiful as ever.
