Plunkett and Macleane are an amazing update to the swashbuckling tradition that precedes Johnny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is merry, with a hint of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. We could see almost Erlat Flynn and Basil Rathbone in it. It starts at low speeds, with the introduction of characters and the setting of topics of social inequality and rebellion; But, once the boys hit the highway, it starts digging. Dandruff is magnificent and stylish, with romantic touches such as bread and swashbuckler butter. The actors get involved and help to raise material a little hollow. The numbers are not very deep, but they play with such charm and skill that doesn't matter. Muh was about modern music said. Periodic music tended to be more calm, which seems to be in place. The classic score with Celtic rhythms for action figures could work, but more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add edge to action. Because characters are more legends than reality, accuracy in music seems unnecessary. The pieces tend to fit into the mood of the broadcast scenes, so it usually works fine. I wonder how they left Adam Anta "Stand and Deliver". Don't be wrong, this is not a serious movie. It is pure escalation and an amazing lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual flavors, but I don't think we'll see many Oscar nods in his career. He seems to understand the material and discard the fine film. Over time, it can turn out to be the name that counts. His father matured for a while beyond visual stylization and became a more rounded director. This is definitely one that looks at a fun evening or film festival.
