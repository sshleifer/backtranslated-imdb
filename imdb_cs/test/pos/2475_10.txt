Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now! Ten years ago, I read that a very special film was directed at the polarization of our society. The author was Peter Watkins. Did his image behave with some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me? and more. The atmosphere of the atmosphere has been described as very realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually. Over the years I've realized how hard it was to find. Maybe by accident? Anyway, it's an old story. I saw it a while ago. Totally impressed. My very favorite art room: Park of Punishments is his name. I love this "dock-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "realityshowfictionnal" what ever. After all the shocking movies I have seen, I achieve the best with this strong and intense film experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough information about the film on the internet. It's even buy on DVD, with other stuff. The only word I want to add is about my own experience with this film. Such sincere and committed peace of art can only trust people and people, those who manage, act or pursue. A cinema that is just a real human experience in an artistic adventure? or vice versa. So I'm not talking about all the "torture" we see on TV, especially the "real" show, which is the concept of people who play it, interesting, but used in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park we can see some real people living as they are. We just put them in a very specific context to follow a few lines and let them be what they want to be. It is a kind of therapy, a way of "individualizing" for those inside the movie, as well as for active viewers in front of the screens. In the end, the director's touch adjusts a short and sweet apocalypse film, a desperate scream, 'Death Camp Opera', where some people are on the run after virulent attempts. Penalty Park is for those who want to grow. Check out this movie and you can choose your own morale. Growing up and harmonizing with it! If you feel it! If you see it !! In my case, the punishment Park is stuck in me forever, with all love, consciousness and will.
