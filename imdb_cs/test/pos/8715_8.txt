Most of the movies from Brigitte Bardot I saw couldn't fully take advantage of her breathtaking presence on the screen. Unfortunately, she was given some really good roles in the films of undeniable quality, which was real surveillance. She deserved them and was able to show her full film power when she came. As Genevieve in "Love on the Pillow", we had a clear exception to the trend of light, fluffy vehicles because it was an interesting, artistic film on every reasonable scale, and there was a 28-year-old BB in it. most tempting. "Une Parisienne" is another, featuring an extremely charming Brigitte in an interesting, well-formed comedy that explores how ambitious a lady's man can be persuaded to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young woman. There are some good performances. Her playboy husband, Michel, is one, "Prince," played by Charles Boyer, is another, with a fun effort of good supportive cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way he looks in this film is the way I remember her as a child in the 1950s. She was 23 in 1957 and toured ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other season actress, including Marilyn Monroe. Her crooked, flirtatious sexuality, richly displayed in a few bare bare, narrow dresses, simply jumps out of the screen. She was more hip and cute than the women of America are today, almost fifty years later. They are obsessed with careers and still desperately hold feminist politics and look like a bunch of clueless lesbians. In stark contrast, the sex kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent, and clearly independent before she was fashionable, though she fully understood the power of her exceptional femininity, used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest - believed in loving. Permanent photography simply couldn't do its justice. You had to look at her slim but sensual form (with a 20 inch waist), lightly across the room. You had to see that wild blond mane, look into her big, brown, seductive eyes, and listen to her full, pouting lips speaking French. In detail at the end of this movie she blinks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful balls flashing. What the baby! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is not to be missed.
