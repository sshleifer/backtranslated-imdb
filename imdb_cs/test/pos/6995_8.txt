This film is a variation of the theme that we have all seen again and again - the Posiedan adventure in space. Characters are all stock figures - heroine heroes, Judas, coward, etc. The only question is who is next to the one who paws him. Sometimes this proven formula works - as in this case - but more often than not - as a really mind-numbing "Red Planet". So why does it work? Because it's stylish. The activity is above average. Above all, it is not predictable. The conclusion is not signed. I really didn't know how it would end up and was surprised how it ended. This in itself deserves the best marks in my book. It's an interesting and fun movie. And although it has never been possible to change the face of the cinema as we know it, it will not disappoint.
