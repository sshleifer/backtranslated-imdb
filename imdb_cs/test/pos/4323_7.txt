Woaww Is it only now that you notice the connection between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond, any deja vu ??? Yeah !! He was the "same" guy who gave money to Sayid after he was killed or tortured by another soldier in episode 14th season 2: One of them. Well, actually, he's not exactly the same guy, his name is Joe in Episode 14 and Kelvin in the last two episodes. Twins? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not even sure :) There are hundreds of links like this among all the characters. But it was only in response to Libby's comment. I found these two episodes more interesting than the whole season 2. I felt there were a lot of things that I missed and very few things I learned. Especially at the very beginning, the first season 2 episode is excellent and then the second is the flash of the first episode ... I found that disappointment is, although I'm sure all in Lost tends to have meaning. This was just an example of how I was confused by watching these episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we've learned more new things in these two episodes than in the whole season. But all we learn are small pieces for another puzzle, such as the involvement of Desmond's "relatives" (sorry if I went too bad, believe me or not. So many things raised in the past two seasons are still unclear or have been And once there is new material, as if all the holes in the picture were not enough, of course we all want to see a big picture of it all, but I think we will have to be very patient. that I will watch more than 3 seasons anyway. There was also a lot of action in the last episode. And a good reef at the very end. So basically yes, I loved the last episode ... and yes, I want see the third season.
