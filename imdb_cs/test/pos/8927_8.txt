I rented this movie with very low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is very good. And no one would ever know it was a low budget. Eighteen, directed by Richard Bell around Pip, 18, playing great Paul Anthony, leaving his home due to the circumstances of his older brother died. He is overwhelmed by this event and falls into the hard life of a fugitive teen on drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father watches Pip down and gives him a tape left to him by his grandfather, which he was supposed to listen to on his 18th birthday. The way the entire movie is said is simultaneously being developed by two concurrent stories. The current life of Pip and his grandfather's past life during WW11 which Pip listens to on tape. Three excellent performances in this film are those from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher plays Jason, a young 18 year old WW11 soldier, his grandfather. Also, the role of WW11 wounded paramedic 'Macauley' played 'Mark Hildreth.' All listed in good performance. A few fears and scenes that didn't sit too well with me ... priest, father Chris played 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and pick up a local street cheater in the broad daylight around. And then we have a local merchant named Jeff, the darling who plays attractive "David Beaszely" who wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason he is attracted to a very attractive and slim street cheater, a director who sleeps with just about anyone and most likely it's a poisonous time bomb. Besides, he's not very likeable. This part just didn't win. <br /> <br /> The parts I like most were flashbacks to war. They were so good and very touching. There is a scene at the end where one soldier dies and the other a soldier, 'Jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love when he lies badly wounded and dying. This is such a wonderful and moving scene that left me in tears. He behaved beautifully. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is love, redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
