This film is clearly the best Fonda movie. The fence is amazing, the acting is amazing and the direction is amazing. The classic of all time, it should win the best picture not kramer Vs. Kramer. Although it was not even nominated. Jack Lemmon and Micheal Douglas are also the best. One of the best ends ever. If you haven't seen this movie run, don't let it go. They were supposed to be at the top 100 afi. Take a look not only at the Fund, but at everything. <br /> <br /> **** out of **** 4 out of 4
