An undervalued, invisible gem. Estevez has remarkable work in illustrating the tensions that arise between the son who was in hell and back, and his parents, who cannot understand the emotional scarring left behind, in a tiny, heartbreaking fashion. It is not unlike the birth of July 4 in that it deals with the emotional and mental disorder of soldiers after serving in Vietnam, but while it has focused more on post-Vietnam politics (anti-war speeches, etc.), this deals with a much more personal theme: Family. One man tries to return to normal after a life-changing experience, and his parents' inability to see the change that has occurred. Estevez brings smoldering performance to Jeremy Collier. Under the surface you can feel pain and frustration. There, to be his thumb to thumb, his real father, Martin Sheen. It's a trip that watches these two things reject each other. It is as if the presence of each other is inspired to be as successful as possible, and their performances triumph because of that. <br /> <br /> It is recommended to anyone who appreciates playing, writing and directing. And to every Vietnam war buff. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
