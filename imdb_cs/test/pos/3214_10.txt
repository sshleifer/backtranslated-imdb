This is a really great series. I love the show and I'm so glad it's not canceled yet. He has a really good humor and shows a realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for girls Gilmore! it's very amazing. they are such a sarcastic funny bunch. They do everything together, just like my mom and me. ya for gilmore girls. I'm running out of lines. but I love Luke and Lorelei's relationship. they had to be together. and I absolutely love Sookie St. James! is so amazing. and the show would not be anywhere without Michel. the whole show is humor, sarcasm and life in a very small town where everyone knows.
