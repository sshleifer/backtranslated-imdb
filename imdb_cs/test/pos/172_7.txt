This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it's a great example of a campy eighties horror flick - low budget, no stars, lots of imaginative scenes of death and enough nudity to keep teenagers in their places. The assumption is interesting and entertaining, and three evil children play well. Nice starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown exposes his talent at the beginning of his career. This movie will not be seen by many people, but it is a horror for 80's fans.
