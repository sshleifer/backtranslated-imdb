This film always hits me emotionally at the end. Although the questions of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes way beyond those narrow parameters of graceful novelty and the path of blazing uniqueness. Here we have a true love story, as the woman who took part in this love affair wrote, and said it in a brilliant, aggressive style that praises the virtues and fame of mad passionate love. I "love" this confirmation of the only emotion that makes life really worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace, and William Holden is simply spectacular in his reporter role. A wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet been in love, even the hope that a day of lightning can strike for you, life is worth living - because love is worth it, though, but for a short time - even if you lose - because love is "things" - the essence of life. This movie works for me. Warm feeling!
