The film opens in a stifling British men's club full of lords in leather armchairs where it smokes cigars. This is Denistoun's world. The messenger gives him a small box that he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. In the place of earrings, the memory of the time he spent in the Gypsy Society is set out. The rest of the movie is flashback. <br /> <br /> Gold earrings have long been the most popular and probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here it is dark-haired, earthy and not a bit mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she tower towers of power and vigorously sets out to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach her goal. To make sure he's a truly convincing gypsy, he gets into his ears and wears his dead lover's gold earrings. With his clothes and some grease, he transforms him from a fancy British gentleman to a wild and sexy looking man. When I grew up, I heard the song "Golden Earrings" sung in the movie. I think the melody is a little submerged by Dietrich. / There's a story that gypsies know is true / When your love wears gold earrings / belongs to you.
