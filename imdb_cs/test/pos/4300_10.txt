This is a stunning movie. Rude and unobtrusively moving. It seemed like a very clever, intelligent scenic play (but without too theatrical feeling that one really gets from watching people on stage) playing the horror of a white lie that escalates to monstrous consequences. All major players are fascinating. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end ... and everyone else judged by the amount of groping for the hankies and the hands rising into the faces between men and women. Julian Fellowes won again. It's a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can't he be wrong?! Go and look! This is a movie for real adults.
