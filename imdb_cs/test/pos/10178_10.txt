A SUPERMAN Cartoon <br /> <br /> A huge shipment of gold is shipped across the country. With ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated group of hooded thieves attempts to uncover gold. With the intrepid reporter Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, Superman is a rescue. But now that it has become a refugee train, can he even stop BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another of the great Max Fleischer cartoons made for Paramount Studio. They feature great animation and tense, fast-moving charts. They wanted to show up at the cinema, they are miles ahead of their Saturday morning counterparts.
