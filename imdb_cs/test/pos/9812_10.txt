Simply amazing bittersweet film that portrays the side of life often skipped in good movies. I saw it as a child, and recently I came back to him and fell in love again. As a child, my interest was purely about building an airplane, as an adult who caught me in a dark world and a young man escapes from this world. The image of the king was great, the camera style chosen with low shots and footage focused on action and hand movements I thought I did well, I personally can't remember anything in this style and style added. to the character and portrays him as a power that is not nearly human (which may not be far from reality), which makes interesting development <br /> <br /> It's worth watching every day
