The film "... and Earth Haven't Met Him", based on a book by Tomas Rivera, is a charming film for most people. He talks about the exploitation that migrant farmers go through to survive. Sergio Perez uses Impressionist techniques to display the story of Rivera. He uses sienna and gray effects to display some scenes, and he uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they did in the 1950s. Perez also gives life to the film using time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing. I feel it's a good movie because it shows how migrant farmers live what they do for fun and their beliefs.
