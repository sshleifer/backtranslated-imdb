Christopher Nolan had his goals in a very narrow direction, and in this respect he got rid of something that reminded me of the great films of the "poor series", such as Ullmer, coming back in the 1940s. Only this time he is able to make touches of things like black and white photography (given the budget for the chains, but also necessary for the dark slits that inhabit these characters) and cast actors (lead John Doe, a slick male counterpart and a beautiful female fatale) - and at the same time keeping it in the nineties underground in india where it was possible for several thousand dollars and specific opportunities in places and music. It, and also in the film-noir mood Nolan also links cunning web conspiracy, perhaps even more than Memento. Where the work of psychology developed through a conspiracy enriched by a glimpse of the last inch by inch, here the nonlinear structure serves to show how far someone like Bill can walk like a dark path like Cobb, only in an environment where Do not keep your fingers for someone who is not really twisted and into the deeper Cobb's mind games. Of course, the whole act of following someone will become the main driver of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would go if it could be some kind of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead your character to one urban British man to another. But establishing Bill to Cobb's ties is done in a quick and exciting way, as we see when Cobb approaches Bill in the cafe to ask what he is doing behind him and says almost everything we need to know about both - the first heist he has to him. brings. What seems to be a good score on the horizon soon is really one big setup for Cobb and his mistress (just called 'Blonde', perhaps too obvious a tribute to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that really guessed me, because manipulating the story has raised questions even more, not so much about why. Density is all the greater as actors understand their basic points as characters, while Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his "deep" ideas of what is actually a burglary, and Theobald with this someone's performance who can never be as clever as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in this naive way that he has no chance in a dank environment like this; It's almost too easy for Russell, even with a face to send Ana Savage, shaking her head. Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman who does not keep anything in the atmosphere and tense, with fade-in / fade-outs not too fast to leave a lasting impression. but enough to add to the logic of 'this-could-lead' script. He follows it in a hand-hand form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic in keeping the basics: close-ups when needing to be (one I like is Russell's face in a small mirror), and quite simple techno t track that never dies. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in "today" and seeing something that is eternal as a solid story of low-level criminals with spiritual games and moral ambiguity is not always quite clear, which is practically irresistible to me in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the biggest business cards I've seen from filmmakers in recent years, and hopefully this will be something future fans of Nolan can look forward to discovering. Or even those who think that noir went into fast-cut and big-gun mainstream shooting (even in independent movies) is a clear 71 minutes.
