Because others have complained about putting Sherlock Holmes into the current environment, I won't do it. Basil Rathbone could become involved in this period, with that voice. This is a pretty secret based freely on "The Dancing Men", one of Conan-Doyle's best stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes men part of the Nazi conspiracy. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His adversary is Moriarity, who dies often enough to compete with the central character in the 13th film. She is definitely creative, but Rathbone Holmes is incomprehensible. Watson is on this path. It's not too stupid in this movie and it's a real plus. The land is complex enough to keep interest. There is a closing speech that is almost parody of yourself. But then I cannot be critical of time and nation that was under great pressure. If they needed to call Holmes, it would be.
