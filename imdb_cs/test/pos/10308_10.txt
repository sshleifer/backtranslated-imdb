Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, the Bandit Queen is a true story, its truth, because the topics it deals with today hold as much truth as it did in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and provocative. of flesh and blood whose adversity has made her the best (or worst). Leading subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that Phoolan's young girl figure, 8 years old, who is married to her father to get rid of debt (pun), the gang leader who becomes the leader of the lower caste, has developed into a champion in her own law. Her depiction is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for the massacre. I can understand whether Western viewers are unable to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen must be "studied" in the Indian context, and not just in stereotypes. I must not sell it on my universal challenge, but it must definitely follow the Indian audience, its a pity that the film had a delayed, apparently censored release in India. Queen Bandit is the story of a woman who fought two courses in India, being a woman and that too low a caste, her rebellious nature and her inability to just give up her has caused the most horrible experiences in life that have further strengthened her to the self-proclaimed goddess. She reacted violently to violence and the dint became an obedient woman she wanted to be. Call it divine justice or the failure of the judiciary if it killed the only person she would hang, killed 24 and earned respect, respect and celebration. PS # One who has found his character "psychotic" needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men at go and marched naked. Then they should be asked - how do they feel?
