I've been watching every version of this game I think, including a few on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is the best Hamlet I've ever seen! He has the most beautiful voice for theatrical play, and his distinctive face takes you on a roller coaster of emotions in this game. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey of madness. He (like Hamlet) can be loving, gentle and gentle at the moment and raging against the hell of his life. You believe he's in pain, you believe he's angry, you believe he's not a little crazy. You believe it's Hamlet. Of course, some of the thanks goes to Shakespeare, of course, :) but without an excellent actor who gets words from the page on stage, it doesn't matter how well written the game is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you must absolutely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, you must absolutely see this version. You will leave with a new Shakespeare award if you do. The irresistible performance Sir Derek offers you will leave you breathless.
