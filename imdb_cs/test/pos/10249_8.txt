The COOLEY HIGH is an elegant comedy comedy that sets off for a period piece (complemented by the flawless Motown soundtrack in the early 1960s). But it's much more to make this movie - it gets better every time I see it. The cast of the unknown (at that time) is excellent, and it is remarkable as an all-black-cast film that does not fall into any Blaxpoitation clich√© - at times COOLEY HIGH almost feels like an updated, urban neo-realistic movie, with lots of nervous humor added in. The relatively tight budget turns out, but the limitations actually serve the film well - there's gravel and sincerity emotions here that lends the film immediacy missing in most like-minded movies (like Schultz 'later CAR WASH, which was more popular but largely absurd Warm-heart, but also true-to-life, it could be one of the fries of the 70s - celebrated at the time, it seems that few film enthusiasts know about this today. Their loss - it's a fine, fine film. Pan-and-scan bare-bones DVD (no widescreen !?) is a testament to how little he cared for this excellent movie.
