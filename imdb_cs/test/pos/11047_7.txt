Anna Christie (1930) Anna Christie has some amazing parts and amazing performances, yet she should be even better than her. She has a drama. Some scenes are really atmospheric, and if the shots around the table are boring, more shots at night and at sea are really exciting. Then there are almost historical, vibrant scenes set in Coney Island (even a short nervous roller coaster ride), and an episode where two women are behind the net in separate beds and visitors in the middle can throw balls trying to tip them. and the women (scaly-dressed) eggs on which they are men are strangely sexual. All the time Garbo (in front of the crowd) watches. Of course, Garbo is what makes this movie more than just another very good early talkie. He plays all sides of his character. She is shy and skeptical and in some inner anxiety. She laughs and cries, pulls back and moves out. In some ways, this is a remarkable, remarkable film (directed by Clarence Brown, who has a number of major films from this pre-code era). Although this is a successful Eugen O'Neil play, it's writing that struggles a bit as actors seem to go through the pace at times. Marie Dressler is great in such an exaggerated way as she is almost a trademark. And then there's Greta Garbo, who has a truly natural presence, though she seems to be a little overweight, sometimes (but then everyone else). Of course, Garbo is mainly known as a silent actress, and this is her debut film debut. The audience loved her so much that she produced the German language version the following year.
