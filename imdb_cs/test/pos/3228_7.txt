Gilmore Girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. She is now 16 (in season 1) and lives as sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely. I like The Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and are charming in their own way. There are some funny support characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai, like everyone else, can even make love, but neither of them really does. They have their little moments. There are some other supportive characters, most of them very funny, and with their winning touch moments. <br /> <br /> What I like most is to see the relationship between a young mother and a daughter who becomes an adult. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, witty and sometimes touches. The band they have is beautiful. Gilmore Girls feel good, so try it.
