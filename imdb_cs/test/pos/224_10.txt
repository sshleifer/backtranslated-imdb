I'm counting "Police Unit!" as the most entertaining TV show of the 1980s. I have nothing more on BetaMax, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show that was good wouldn't last and I had to keep it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers did not know that "a police unit!" it was a comedy because it had no laughter! Right! When Drebin has such a line as: "You give yourself a chance to just get up in the morning, go to work or keep your face in the fan.", How can it be a comedy!?!? I have seen every episode at least ten times and I've seen something new I missed before. Even the deep background still has gags. Do not miss if you have a chance to see the episode, but if you read it, then you probably already have a copy that broke somewhere.
