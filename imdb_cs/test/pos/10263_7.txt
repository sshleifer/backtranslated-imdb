Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological questions about the opposite sex, kidnaps one employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men must be "solid" instead of women. Sayer retreats to his palace estate and leads Mary through a humiliating series of games that threatens to harass and kill her. It seems that Sayer's desire is to control her body, mind and soul, make her sexual slave, obey his commands, adhere to every wish and whim. After the resistance, Maria is slowly moving towards her goal, but she has plans for her own. He says he wants to help Sayer give up his sadistic behavior towards women so that he can love and not feel such a desire to hurt. Sayer has a grip on her, agrees with some somewhat embarrassing scenarios (eg, Lotions on the feet, "making love" for a doll, which is in itself fun, often spends time on top, and even jumps down when she wrapped him hard over the face that brought him blood from his nose), which almost broke it, but something happens when a troubled physician falls in love with Marie ... and through what seems to be a desperate attempt to end the madness, Maria gets the top hand, playing with Sayer's lust for his body. More battle of wills, some kind of sexual struggle, where one of them seems to be in charge, when in fact the other really has the upper hand. Through a large amount of film, Sayer is mistaken for Mary and forces her (.. it seems) to submit to her series of psychological games of a sexual nature. Her attempts to escape because his home is such a well-designed fortress .. it's a typical European style art deco palace that is created and controlled by a man who stayed on this weekend's retreat for quite a charm (.. walls and doors opening on his command, with space in quarantine for his "victims". But as soon as Maria ostensibly shoots down a bottle of pills as a result of her anxiety in his hands, the tables are turned and got him where he wants him. She learns that she really desires it, and Maria uses it to her advantage when Sayer wants to embrace and ravage her (and I understand his frustration because he has this attraction that can go crazy). Br /> <br /> I felt that the film eventually worked as a war cry for women, their empowerment and rebellion against men who have the idea that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. "Twist" completes this ideal. I couldn't swallow Sayer's fate because of his strict cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen .. we see how his toned athletic body evolves, and how this mode is part of the routine every weekend before the real mind of the game with his victim start. If he is so well fit and spends so long as he develops for extracurricular activities that follow his regime, how could he suffer the fate that follows his conclusion with Mary at the end when he resists his advances? Maria, who he would later admit, is the first he has actually kidnapped; others from the past, girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer felt the power to control a woman, even though it was all a fictitious charade caused by a deeply disturbed individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so, to make a leap from the norm, costs him more than he could ever know. All this psycho-sexual sub-text is rather fascinating to see the disintegration, but Dagmar Lassander, such a wonderful sex kitten, was my reason I enjoyed it so much ... without her, I couldn't I liked it so much because it is vital because the victim is worth trying. Maybe the movie is a highlight, a delicious dance like Lassander, dressed in gauze (!), Crumbling Wardrobe Exposing Her Breasts Jazz Score .. It's a kind of sexually seductive moment that makes mouth water and forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander had to be a pleasure for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well .. she has this kind of cool, sophisticated and on-screen presence along with her beauty and seductive abilities, Dagmar crosses the part to create an iconic character that would define her career. .If the movie is not well known (.. I found about oral). The provocative nature of the screenplay and the risqu√© theme may not appeal to certain crowds because it deals with sex (... and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue is rather illustrative and complicated. Sometimes I couldn't help myself before Sayer's commentary on the imprisoned Mary thought about looking forward to the fact that women were suffering, and the excitement that got into him in slavery (in an attempt to make poetic words). , it all looks rather hokey). But Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, for me, works on the best of fetish film, on the possible male imagination with this seemingly primary and right idealist, captured and held against her will, forced into an uncertain situation, her fate perhaps at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her surrender and how she reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (... there are times when she develops with a desire to embrace him, to reveal a possible attraction to him, which in itself can surprise some who follow it). most interesting feature of this feature. My favorite scene, besides dancing, is the piano concert with Sayer Cunning Maria when playing a soothing melody.
