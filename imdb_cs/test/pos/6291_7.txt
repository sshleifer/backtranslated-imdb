I didn't expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised that I enjoyed it. Several scenes made me almost uncontrollable. The characters were engaging (no pun intended); however, the story is predictable. The fun of it comes from watching Crawl (Shore Character), a ditzy-still-wise California dude country student bringing home for Thanksgiving, trying out his embarrassing (but cute) way to fit into their lifestyle. I was also surprised that there was a message in all this. If you have a chance, check out this movie!
