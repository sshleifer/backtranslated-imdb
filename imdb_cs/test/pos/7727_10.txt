I enjoyed Carmen, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities and enjoyed it too. I felt the performance was stronger here (Paz Vega displayed a wider range, has more fire and Sbaraglia was also great). Overall, their acting behavior was more bold, more believable (less dreamy than the original sin, and both actors had less "celebrity status" and "pretty face" to rely on film work. Vega definitely szzles as expected. br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (better than Original Sin) that lets you feel the dirt and everyday life of archaic Spain - for example, people unloading goods from a cart on the street, workers changing street lamp candles, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> Although I sympathize with the recent idea of ​​redeeming our femme fatals (like Brian de Palma's Femme Fatale), Carmen is a charming, modern, noir classic Double Indemnity and is a nice pleasure to watch which is another great example of the triumph of a courageous European cinema over the shimmering and safe Hollywood fare.
