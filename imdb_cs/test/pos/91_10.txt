This film made by NFBC was made in honor of Montreal's Canadian dynastic years in 50, 60 and 70's. My 5th year teacher played in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I was a Canadians fan of 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this movie 117. All hockey fans should see it as I hope it will be placed in the Toronto Hockey Hall of Fame and will be exhibited at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton, Rexal Place. Watch this movie with family is a great movie. I also recommend a book in French and English. Go Habs Go.
