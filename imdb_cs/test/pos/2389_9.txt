I was in a friend's house for Thanksgiving and I watched the DVD of Eddie Monroe. I was a fan of India Films for nearly 20 years, (I loved the McMullen Brothers), and was amazed at how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot at Super 16. The photo was so good, it looked like it was 35mm shooting. The music, combined with the direction of Fred Carpenter, was art. The storyline was original and led to the end that surprised all of us to observe ... very cool. The whole cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was amazing. This movie was a nice holiday treat, and I was glad to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
