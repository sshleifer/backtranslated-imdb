Anyone looking for an episode of "Law and Order" or "CSI" would have to look elsewhere in this case because the most basic elements of police or forensic work were completely ignored in this case. Murder instead, and all the cops were doing was to catch a 15-year-old boy from the street and take him to a single witness - a 65-year-old man - and say he's the man who did ? Sure, the old man thought the kid in the back of the police car must be guilty. it doesn't matter that he didn't look like a real killer and he was dressed completely differently. He had to shrink, turn his age 5-10 years and change his clothes. The police have made no effort - and admitted it! They did not make any forensic statements on any of the evidence, did not question any other witnesses, and defeated a 15-year-old confession. The saddest thing about this convincing view of the criminal justice system is that it happened right down the road in Jacksonville, Florida. And now everyone will start talking about "southern justice."
