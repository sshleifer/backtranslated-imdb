This was one of the best movies you could find as a child. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 to 8 years old. The story of this film was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and holds a boy with Miss Miller. While playing the Around the World video game in 80 days, two villains Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister) circulate Chipmunks and Chipettes into an adventure in which children have to move around the world. What they don't realize is that the "game" is really a ring of diamond smuggling. And when villains find themselves at the airport, chase follows! And that ends in Klaus and Claudia out of prison and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But now I warn you, this is a musical and pretty damn good. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I'm frigging love musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Don't Dance, and just anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see it, share it with your children (if you have any)!
