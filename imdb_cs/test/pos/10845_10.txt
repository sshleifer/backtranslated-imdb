I watched Tipping the Velvet over the weekend, and if I were to have this movie of 100, I'd have to give him 100 questions. I am a true believer in true love and this film has moved me in many different ways and the actors have joined them without doult. But I have to say that the end wasn't so big that I couldn't see the spark in Nancys' eyes as she looked into Flo's eyes as her eyes sparkled every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty had to be in the room or in Nancy's thought and Nancy would just shine that spark. Kitty told Nancy she couldn't find her and that she was looking for her, but she couldn't find her. Kitty was ready to give everything back to Nancy. She saw Kitty's pain in Kitty's eyes. I believe Nancy should have left Kitty to see that their love is true and strong and that she won't let her go so easily. You have to do the second part and have two together, but you can't allow anyone else to play the roles that must be a real Kitty & Nancy, or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is not real. I'm not a fool, I know we all have some real love somewhere, waiting for each of us and I believe Nancy really has only love Kitty and the true love of Kitty is just Nancy. Let's play the game in the right way, the only way. Let Nancy shine again ... Kitty lost everything when she lost Nancy. And Kitty shouldn't be the only one who's guilty. I'm gay alone and being gay isn't easy! WAKE!!! in 1889 I wouldn't want to be homosexual, Kitty was lost deep inside herself and in 1889 maybe the right thing to be married to was a man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to face her needy Nancy to fight for her. I remember how deeply I loved this girl and let her leave because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my former friend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to let go of it, and I'll pay for the rest of my days because I couldn't find her as Kitty. I heard he's married to a man in the US. I even heard he was beating her. I think we will eventually lose both. Give both girls one more chance that life can be very lonely unless you are true to you and your beloved person.
