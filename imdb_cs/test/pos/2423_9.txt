*** SPOILERS *** The feeling of lonely and necessary friendship, as well as the love of Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through the life of a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But because of his own deep insecurity, he holds them in his arms. Regarding Frances, friends from other countries are nowhere near her age to have no reason to have any romantic engagement with them. One morning in the evening, when Frances amused some of her friends, she saw a young man's window, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold rain at her apartment. She feels he's homeless and alone, after her friends leave Frances, goes out into the park and offers a young man a refuge in place until the rain disappears and stays in the guest room she has overnight. You can see that Frances is more interested just to get the young men safely out of the cold and rain, then she wants to have him as a friend of a friend or even play a toy for herself, and as the movie goes on, you'll see they were right. Really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis, who is in a way very similar to the performance of Kathy Bates' Academy Award in "Misery", which was created in 1990 about twenty years later. Frances thought the young man was alone and homeless, and when he met him, mute sees a perfect man who has a true friend. She is by no means the same or better than her friends, the Indian chiefs, and so she is completely dependent on her. Later it turns out that the young man is not lonely and homeless, whom Frances thought she was. It's when he slowly realizes that he doesn't really need it, just as he manipulates her instead of, instead, puts something into the mind of Frances, who turns out to be an urge to murder proportions. A truly weird film by director Robert Altman, which goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is perfect as a dr. Jekyll and Miss Hyde in her acting as a lonely but dangerous Frances Austen and it is a pity she not only won an Oscar for her role in the film. but he wasn't nominated for it either. Like most of Robert Altman's films, there seems to be a lot of improvisation between the actors in the film and the pound dialogue, especially between the young man's sister Nina, Susanne Benton and her friend Nick, David Garfield. All I have in the movie I found confused is when we see Frances go to the clinic to have a gynecological examination and tell the doctor that she is expected to marry soon. Was her husband a young man who stayed in her apartment? In addition, the film keeps on the story pretty well and the end is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man. Eventually, when she realizes that Frances is not just a bit out of the wall, she is also insane.
