Good News: The director is allegedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and eager to deliver a strong message of freedom of expression and evil oppression. The storyline is clearly original and the actors are two of my favorite favorites. No-so-good news: 'original' is not every buzzer when visiting movies or video stores. Also, noted critics like Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert rejected the film as a truly unsuccessful attempt to transform the game from stage to film form. As I recall, the title is taken from a fairy tale written by Stowe's character and made it a possible subversive and suspicious person in the fictional place where the story takes place. Her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented by Rickman as an intense, manipulative investigator. Since these two people are actually the only ones who ever appear in the film, the director is in the real challenge of keeping the viewer's attention. I finally fascinated the whole thing. Not flawless and definitely not for everyone but rewarding. It is nowhere near the masterpiece, such as Kieslowski's "Short Killing Movie" or as an explanatory "dead man's walk". But if you are in those movies or some political thriller Costa-Gavras, you can appreciate this. Do not expect any excessive preaching or action sequences eyefilling.
