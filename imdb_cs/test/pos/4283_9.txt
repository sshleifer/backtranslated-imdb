How people can give this movie a low rating. Incredible. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can imagine that these critics were weaned on blockbusters and pornography. (If it sounds bad, it's because I just wiped my original 400 word right now) I was so impressed by Tom Wilkinson. All friends. This is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill. His development as an actor from Full Monty to this masterpiece of performance is amazing; one of the best things that have been done in filmmaking over the past decade. Emily Watson is somewhat less commanding because of her eyes, "do you see me?" this cheeky woman? You can't guess what I'm going to do next, because I don't even know! It seems to be something that can't help us show us in every role, but is still an actor of amazing abilities and presence. He's very sexy as he needs it, and a fair game for her: it's a screen quality that normally doesn't have for me in previous movies. <br /> <br /> As you can expect, Rupert Everett, must play a higher class late-30 something who could give Phd tutorials on how not to throw a header to hell on account of total selfishness, brings . He's so thin, in the whole movie, but I'm afraid of him. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a smaller role, but with a great conspiracy she will bring you, she is wondering how much talent we have in Britain in terms of acting. I want to see her more. <br /> <br /> The narrative arc is fine; it is an interesting plot, since no one in the filmmaking seems to be trying to convince Joe Publica that there is nothing new under the sun, even though the last "reel" is wandering towards the 40s melodrama. But it doesn't matter - that's an amazing value of 80 minutes for anyone who has money from half the brain. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes on his first directorial effort: o How we need more films of this stuff. He has many skills in adapting the original novel, telling the story with great efficiency and gentleness. And also congratulations on the fact that we have created an immense performance of the film actor Tom Wilkinson. That's geezer. T. / T.
