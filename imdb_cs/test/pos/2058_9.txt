I enjoyed this movie immensely. I'm really in the movies where the female kick a lot of ass, so this movie already had my hopes for some decent fun. My hopes were fulfilled and exceeded less than 20 minutes in the movie. The action, humor and joke of this movie included one of my favorite movies of all time. She had Sam Jackson and his undeniable presence on the screen, Geena Davis, when I had never seen her before, I asked for your respect and chose it, even if you didn't want to give it. Geena plays Samantha Caine, amnesia has desperately remembered something about her past, but quickly realized the more she finds out, the more she wants to forget, and eventually consumes it, until finally Samantha is more and Charly is all , which was. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, exist in the same body? We have characters that emerge from a movie that educates every side of Sam / Charly, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible as Timothy, a sexy evil man with no conscience. This film was perfectly cast and perfectly behaved, up and beautifully entertaining. You watch the impossible and applaud when it does. So it's worth your time. Watch it, you won't regret it.
