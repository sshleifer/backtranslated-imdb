In the second of his films Historical Martial Arts, Chiba portrays his real life Mas Oyama sensei. The film even restores Oyama's incredible performance, who killed a furious bull with his bare hands (Oyama did it more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic combat choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, it is one of Sonny Chiba's rare films, in which parts of the enemy's body are not torn off or detached. For fans of Sonny Chibu, one of his best is 5 films
