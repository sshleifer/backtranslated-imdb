Before I continue with the new millennium, I will come back again in time, because I have completely forgotten about these gems !!!!! In 1987, Disney, still a "low" company in the 1980s, was able to launch a series of films on television called "Not a Pretty Man," by a geeky teenager who, like in the "Inspector Gadget ", looks like a man, but is really a robot !!!!! Now it's the SCREAMS 80S, along with other movies like "Tron" and "Honey, I'm shrunking kids" because it combines everything from ancient times with tomorrow's technology !!!!! it was on TV when I was just born or something. However, my first encounter with this movie was on Old Disney Channel (once I saw it, and another part on my 12th B'day in May '99 !!!!!) <br / "<br/> "No quite human "is a very good series of movies you can watch if you can find these movies again. <br /> <br /> Has it been recently demonstrated? If so, give me an email or personal message. <br /> < br /> 10/10
