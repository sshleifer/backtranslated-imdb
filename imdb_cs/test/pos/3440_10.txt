For the first time I saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 1990s, when I was at art school living and moving between artists and musicians hoping for future success. "The Second Home" - the friendship that happened after leaving the family home, the pursuit of professional perfection - strongly resonated with my living reality. I was intrigued by characters, narration, lyrical camera and especially music. In it, I was able to show the beginnings of German electronic music, 50s Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, 70s Faust, John Cage Sound Experiments, Walter Carlos and British White Psychedelie The White Noise. Composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana-fame, so I found that his contemporary taste is in the world of electronic pops / sound effects. I didn't see Heimat or Heimat 3, so I saw it all by itself without before or after. As someone commented, it's both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments including the gorgeous voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), Bach's marimba of Daniel Smith (Juan), the piano play of Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the cello playing Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but that's been said. Why can't British or American TV PRODUCE TAK MASTERPIECES? The wire had realism and politics, and the epic screening of the city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter had the imagination of the tropics to their serialized television work as well, but this is an art-house and soap in its most kinematic and narrative noble. It is never included in the selection of critics of the best films, but it should be. Still as poetic and strong as when I first saw him more than 17 years ago. I look at 3 box sets every fall for their 'soft fertility'. Inspired and inspiring.
