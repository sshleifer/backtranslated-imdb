The radio will laugh, cry, feel. This true story story is the perfect movie for a couple who can see it. There's enough for both of them. Cuba Gooding Jr.portrays character title to perfection. His performance is worthy of nomination for the Academy. The film's compassion is obvious. The film evokes many emotions. I really enjoyed this movie.
