The last days were a very moving film for me, showing how hard and impolite the gay community is. The film ascribes a real passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters, the film has a real depth of compassion for the gay community because it really talks to a gay man / woman. Personally, I think it is high time that the homosexual community of all religions should no longer hold their heads in shame, just because there is a beautiful self. The film was a very open eye for me because I couldn't believe how the world really was against gay. Even in schools, if a child doesn't like something to refer to as "gay." I really hope to make more movies like this, and that they are not just labeled as "Gay" movies, but as a love story, because I believe gay directors should stick to themselves and tell their story through the eyes.
