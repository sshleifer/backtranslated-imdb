Certainly worth watching. Ten different directors present a segment based on their favorite opera aria. You don't have to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you'll have a really bad time with this!) No wonder the segments range from brilliant to fair. Most fuss seems to be over Godard's contribution - whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious, his segment won't change your mind. Some pieces have a clear story; others are more assembled linked images. <br /> <br /> None of the pieces are longer than 10 minutes; If you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you are dipping. Keep your eyes open for Buck Henry's performance, Beverly D Angelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briget Fonda, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Buck segment alone is worth the cost). <br /> <br />
