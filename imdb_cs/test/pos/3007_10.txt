I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I surfed the channel during my vacation. It's a great show, I just wish it wasn't that late at night. It's at 12:30. As a working person, it's hard to keep track of all the time. <br /> <br /> I've read some comments. I did not agree that the latter in the 1960s did not grow and I do not believe it can happen. I grew up in the sixties. I am Hispanic and had a "white" friend and we had black high school friends. I believe that people are getting out of their interests and personalities and have nothing to do with it being a race or color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see the show go on DVD so I can buy it. This way I see it from the beginning.
