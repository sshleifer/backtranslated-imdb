It was a TV show that I watched as a child in the 1960s and captivated her. In many years that have passed, I have often thought about this exhibition and how well it would be to watch it again, but be aware that things from the past are not always as good as you remember them. That was a great show in the sixties and didn't lose anything, even in 2007. Certainly there are some strange manufacturing mistakes you see in watching old shows, and it takes a few episodes to get used to dubbed voices, but when I did it was I'm as impressed as I was in the sixties. Samurai plays Koichi Os, who plays a very humble role. I remember during the 1960s, due to the show's popularity here in Australia, he traveled to perform the sword game etc, and was impressed by the interest in the show and in it. It was great that one of my favorite shows still held the spell she did during my childhood. Must see the series.
