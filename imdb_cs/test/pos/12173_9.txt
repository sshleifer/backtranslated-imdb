Great movie. I laughed all the time. Why? I am from Austria, I can get with the German (Bavarian) type of humor. So I think this film just makes sense when you're a German native speaker. Stefan and Erkan both speak in a new kind of Turkish-German accent that has become very popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But of course they are very stupid. As in any comedy, your personal humor will be decided, either with your thumb up or down.
