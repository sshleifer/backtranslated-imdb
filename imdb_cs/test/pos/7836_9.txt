Forget about some whimsical (and nonsensical) comments left by some. This series is well acted, well shot, and makes a refreshing change to most pap on television. Any fool can nitpick anything. However, in this show the characters are believable, the story stories interesting and convincing (but they require some intelligence from the viewer), overall it's nice, and it's British! (Sometimes we come up with some gems, and that's one of them). The shows are long every hour and I think all four are together (at least I saw four). The show clearly impressed some American television station / director who made a long series that was far from convincing despite a larger budget. <br /> <br /> If you like soaps and realities, you will not like the eleventh or understand the Hour.
