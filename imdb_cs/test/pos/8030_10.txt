I'm a huge spy genre fan and that's one of the best of these movies. The assignment is based on a true story that has been somewhat decorated on the big screen and will really please you with a fun ride. The film has a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. Naval Officer Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after an accidental encounter with Kingsley who believes Quinn to be a famous terrorist Carlos Shakal. Because Quinn so closely resembles Carlos, Sutherland stops for nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with terrorist's capture or death. <br /> <br /> Training sequences are amazing. Quinn is really tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, he must endure attacks from remotely controlled snowmobiles, eat the same food every day, be treated with hallucinogen. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman as Carlos wants. The film has some great action scenarios with Quinn, who avoid allies because they believe that Carlos is in his last mission to kill a jackal. Throughout the film, Quinn has to fight a new personality he has achieved over his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as Carlos or will he return to his life as a good husband and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, it's necessary to see it. The action is only used to drive the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or combat scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
