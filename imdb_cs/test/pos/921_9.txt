It is a classic sequel to Bleu, an equally excellent movie, with Julia Binouche as the main star, and here she is in Rouge, just for a moment at the very end. This film, really red and very sweet, though very sad, is the real winner. The main character, always played by great Irene Jakob, is a successful model of photography / fashion. He leads a full, active life, just darkened by traumatic relationships with her strange friend Mike, who is in England. With a lucky chance, she's friendly with an old judge who spends time listening to his neighbor's private phone conversations. The story begins to deepen further, and we see it before a court that is almost universally convicted of having fun. He is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute dog Rita and her cubs and for all the people who surround them. We are also witnessing the disintegration of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his mistress, and their quarrel is also driven by a phone scandal ... But the film is not about it. Above all, it is loneliness and deep schisms between people, far and near. When sailing to England on a ferry, with a lawyer as a co-driver's chances, as well as the aforementioned Binoche who played in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the judge's horrified look as he watches the news he tries to get. guess if she survived. She has done and we still feel very hard at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a large, subtle story of loneliness, misunderstanding, mystery and pain. The deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.
