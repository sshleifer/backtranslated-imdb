This is one of those movies where it's easy to see how people wouldn't like it. My wife never saw it, and when I read it last night, I waited for her to go to bed. Maybe she was amused by a few small snippets, but I know she'd have enough in ten minutes. The head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly rooted in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as film surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acidic trip through film genres. If you're not a big fan of those things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism, and the "aesthetics" of a sour trip (assuming there is a difference between them), you should probably refrain from this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fan of this thing, you have to run now and buy Head if you haven't already. This has probably a lot to do with prejudice. After all, he plays The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees was a musical group of actors, compiled by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to become friendly, bubble-filled guys. rubber Beatles for TV series. In their era they had as much respect as, say, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, Spice Girls, and so on. As the IMDb colleague rightly notes to the reviewer - "Maybe the people of 1968 who thought of the Monkees as stupid factory-produced Beatles pop bands refused to see (Head)". Monkees and Head have never managed to get rid of the negative public perception. It's a shame because there were a lot of talent in The Monkees, both musically and otherwise. It's probably the courage that Rafelson, who runs and collaborates with Schneider and Jack Nicholson (yes, that's Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produced, decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's like New Kids on the Block suddenly released an album equivalent to Ummagumma Pink Floyd (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in the head, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators like Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a quality similar to Floyd, somewhere between Syd Barrett's era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more pronounced than any Beatles resemblance. Some people have complained about music in the movie, but for me, all the songs are gems. Some people don't like Barrett's era (or other) Floyd, which is just as difficult for me to empathize with. But what about? The foundation is that The Monkees embark on a tour of various film genres - war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, dramatic scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romantic scenes, and more. . Except that the film actually appears, it happens primarily (if not exclusively) in the studio. In the roots we watch Monkees shoot the movie. Of course all scenes in different genres have something surrealistic and confident about them, and they, and individual shots within the scene, tend to lead to each other using dream logic that is not different from the Monty Python TV show. As a dream, the head tends to vacillate between a good dream and a nightmare, while often being one that would make you laugh in sleep (something I often do, by the way). Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to implement the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are plenty of very fast cuts (including a great sequence that features Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in the white and black rooms, wearing a combination of white and black turned in each that sometimes switches over there and back as fast as two frames at a time), there are plenty of bizarre segues, there is an animated mouth of cows, there are odd editing devices and so on. For my money, I wish it was not just a remnant of a psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach I enjoy. It seemed like a good idea and I still think it's a good idea. I'd like to see movies like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) using these types of advanced techniques. Now that would make this movie surreal. Interpretatively, some people who aren't so in tune with an acidic aesthetic trip complained that it's basically b.s. Offer Meanings for Something Not to Have. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; The head was supposed to have many senses and it's not just a film without conventional charts that have more interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot of interesting things on The Monkees - the film postmodernically comments on their status; pop Stardom - The journey ahead of Pink Floyd, Head connects pop star and violence, from war images to images of fans who cannibalistically dismantle their idols; and the naive American focus on international perception and respect - well-armed foreigners in the desert surrender to Micky Dolenz simply because he is an American, then later blows up a Coke machine (again in the desert) because he is thirsty and cannot be accessed. The film comments on many other topics - from the big industry to the police, surveys, viewers (especially in relation to tragedies) and beyond. The head is full of ideas, reasonably, with the intelligent, multifaceted things they say about them. The head deserves to be considered a classic - it's basically shooting the same atmosphere as the yellow Beatles. Both premieres premiered in November 1968, interestingly enough, and both were intended as a summary of psychedelic aesthetics. Yellow submarine was not successful. The head is everything The yellow submarine was supposed to be.
