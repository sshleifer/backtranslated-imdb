Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that definitely polarizes viewers. You either like it or not. Personally, I consider most of the pieces to be merry, but has "huh"? moments. Staples as "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for laughter, but my favorite bit must be a one-time "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular piece that usually keeps me confused (which is part of this point!) Spike and his writers team will from time to time crush a lot of fresh comedy, so the show never feels stale. Feresten's brand of humor may not be for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying. The masses have spoken! We like this show and we want more. Please note that I am no friend or affiliate with Spike Feresten, "Talkshow with Spike Feresten Staff" or Fox Network and Affiliates. It's just funny!
