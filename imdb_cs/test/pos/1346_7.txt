I saw it last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general, it was funny and I liked the characters of Sabrina in particular. Acting is good and the story was fine, except for the end that left the way to many loops and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been so much better . The film displayed the rules of life really well and we laughed all over. He has mistakes that are certain, but for Ash Christian's first movie, I thought it was good. You may want to wait for a DVD on this. But if you have a chance to see it give you a chance
