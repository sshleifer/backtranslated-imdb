Now the game is full, right? The jokes were done. It's over. The creative genius who drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all. <br /> <br /> Bad. The game is still untouched, jokes are here, people. Sure, they're all rehash, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1, that's for it. The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between slightly easy 1 and ridiculously hard 2. The ship's sub-game is poorly in the sub-game tradition. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When you are asked for a membership card for an exclusive beach, always select "You don't need to see my ID". It is worth the price of the game itself.
