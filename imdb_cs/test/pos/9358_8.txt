"Crossfire" is a well-known noir of 1947, which is a mystery of murder with a strong message. It is Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We are witnessing a shade murder at the beginning and, for the rest of the film, Young, as a detective, Finlay, who is in charge of the case, is trying to find out which of the three soldiers is responsible for death and equally important why. Victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet at the bar; they go to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels ends up dead. I don't know about 1947, but see "Crossfire" today, one knows who did it and why minute we see suspects. I suppose it wasn't that obvious at the time because these actors started. However, the film contains a big blow with its powerful effect, good direction, violence and inexorable anti-Semitic language. Characterization is alive, including Gloria Grahame in a minor role, a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspicious soldiers, at the bar and can give him an alibi. Great performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young is particularly effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very sympathetic as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely person who is not sure if he has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Really great and must see.
