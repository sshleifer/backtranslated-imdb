Repeat the Oscars since 1992 and this movie could be nominated or even won. It was so good to capture his era and dual cultures that belong to American and Japanese time capsules. If you want to know what's going on here or there, this movie will show you. As an American, you will feel like you are tagging for a prolonged Japanese vacation, and at the end of the movie you will be a fan of rough dragons when you take a Japanese tradition and culture to your baseball just as we did with our culture in our own game. Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a sunken, aging Detroit Tigers shooter that is sold to dragons, steadfast runners to the finals. Dynastic Yomuri Giants, a Japanese response to the Yankees. Giants are admired for their success, but success also has everyone who wants to overcome them, something that is rarely done. The Dragon Manager recruits Jack as the last piece of the puzzle that won the battalion, and we stayed with what Gung Ho could be on the baseball field, but there was much more instead. Casting was excellent: Selleck proved that with a good screenplay and character that suits him, he can carry a film just as he did his TV show, and the Japanese cast was as good as Mr. Takagi of Die Hard back as image owner. Other actors, including those who are interested in love (also the manager's daughter), strong and independent, but also believer in Japanese tradition, beyond what was forced on her. She's the right and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father would never tell her not to see him, she almost sympathized with Jack for what she could do, and a little relieved that at least she knew the man she had chosen to love. Baseball scenes are big, immensely endorsed by Dennis Haysbert as another American ex-patriot and Jack's western mentor. There are the usual elements of water, and you almost feel that you will come across Jack to fit into a country that does not speak our language, and does not travel, but replicates everything we do, including our national entertainment. one of the most entertaining scenes comes when Jack, who holds the magazine, informs his manager that he has learned about the tradition in Japan, where you can get drunk and tell your boss, and that can't be used against you. very humorous. Land and sub-markets are tied neatly at the end, but not neatly, and nothing comes unrealistically. To name it, comedy is misleading: it's a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. The story is too deep to reject him as critics considered him to be an actor from his league, trying to wear a light film. The situations were fun, but in their place against a much more serious, deep and detailed background that resulted in one of the best movies I've ever seen. Baseball cinematography competes with For Love Of The Game, for realism. Some say the film is about baseball or about Japan, but more than anything that seems to be about the workplace and how people come to work from a completely different origin, with different agendas, and somehow They must put their differences aside for the good of the company or team. A really great movie that should never have been apologizing for itself as it was in theaters.
