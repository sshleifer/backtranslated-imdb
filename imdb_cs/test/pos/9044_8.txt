This is a 1972 Disney movie. At that time I was eleven years old and I enjoyed this movie. I felt nostalgia and bought three series of Dexter Riley DVDs and even enjoyed them at the age of 46. It was all about imagination, magic and pure fun. And it is still! I wasn't sure which of the three movies came first and second. So now I have official data. December 31, 1969 Computer Wearing Tennis Shoes - July 12, 1972 Now you see it now, no - February 6, 1975 The strongest man in the world. I still think medium movie was the best. Special effects were amazing for us children in 1972. I definitely recommend it to all age categories.
