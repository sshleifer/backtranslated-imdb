When I first bought this movie, I had doubts about it, though it was pretty impressive. But after seeing it, I really regret spending money. In fact, I would like to spend it again and again on films like this ... an absurd combination of humor, drama, excitement and big questions. This is exactly what makes it a great movie. Okay, some might not enjoy what they see, and some might turn it off after a while. your loss. It's a great way to deal with the issues we've experienced in one or the other way. love after a short while. For anyone who has an open mind and a sense of humor and life - watch this movie, I promise you that you won't be disappointed!
