"Robin Hood: Men in Stockings" didn't get any respect. It was hilarious! Cary Elwes was excellent as "Prince of Thieves" and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin did a great job. I will never understand hostility to "Robin Hood: Men in Stockings," but I know when I see one great comedy. "Robin Hood: Men In Stockings" Receives *** Of ****.
