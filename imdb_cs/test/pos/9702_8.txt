My sister, friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We all saw the first "Jackass" movie back for a while, and we all enjoyed it. We were really looking forward to number two. We were not disappointed. From the beginning to the end, I laughed hysterically. It's the same shocking and fun part, but definitely not for those who have weak stomachs. It's obscene, but it's also a breakthrough American cinema ... well, maybe it's a little too much praise for a movie when men intentionally get a scrotum on ice sculptures, but it's pioneering in showing us that we have obscenity We like it or not, things that no other "decent" American movie released across the country would dare to show us. There was only one scene I felt unnecessarily obscene, and that included horses - I'm not going to work. I laughed, almost said, and I came damn close to crying (from a physical reaction to watching a scene including leeches and eyeballs, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the movie '06. Does it heck me? Maybe. But if so, I could really care less.
