That was a nice movie. She had an interesting story that was pretty well executed in the later part of the movie. The story reminded me a little of the City of God. But this is nicer than that. It had what I really loved: a touch of surrealism. Some very interesting cinematography (over the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but you are definitely expanding as you look at South Africa. The actors were good (for the first timers, most of them the same way), mainly I liked the Estelle character who made this movie pleasant. But what is interesting is that it forces you to ask your own life. Do you really do what you really love? Or you agree with the norm, with the convention around you. Definitely worth the watch.
