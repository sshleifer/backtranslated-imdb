If you're looking for a movie that's fast and not bored, then it's a place. It's a fast pace and funny with some decent acting coming out of the characters. For me, it's always hard to see Mark Walhberg as something other than Mark Mark. The image is burned forever in my mind. As an actor, though he is pretty good. This movie needs to be seen for action fans who want to see a few small twists and turns. I'll have to pick this movie one day and buy it.
