A righteous and handy little sci-fi / horror fantasy thriller about the well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only attracts the attention of people who voluntarily try the game, but whoever kills her and her game). Because she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee ("PR nerd") being her bodyguard, though he only has a gun that is made of meat and bone and bullets. are teeth. Director David Cronenberg used some of his earlier films ("Videodrom", "Scanners", "Fly", etc.) and placed them in certain parts of the story with some good timing. Right and Leigh are all right, so are some of the supportive casts (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on) that has an international twist on it. Dafoe is nothing but a devil's gas, a decoy garage mechanic. One of the best scenes of the film is to witness Ted eat (fish and frogs) and build a weapon and admit that Allegra - "I can't help it." "eXistenZ" proves that he (Cronenberg) is on his old tricks and still works as a spell.
