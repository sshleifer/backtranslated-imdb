I love young people trapped in the house of horror movies. Not only because I'm a huge Linn Quigley-Jill Terashita fan, but because it's a lot of fun and sometimes scary. Special effects are amazing, especially Linnea with lipstick and the end when almost everyone is dead and obsessed. Lots of nudity that Linnea and Jill provide, lots of humor, great soundtrack, high number of bodies, etc. By the way, if you've never seen this, try buying / watching a Unrated version that has more Scenes rated version missing.
