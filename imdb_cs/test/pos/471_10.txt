It was a fantastic film about two people, one young teenage girl and the other, middle-aged men looking for someone to help them fulfill a void left by their former relatives. Both actors give brilliant performances that can be seen by different audiences. The script, though written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from the perspective of a woman. And at the same time, men can relate to male characters because of how well they have been developed and described in the film. The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you alone. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this film that you are not alone.
