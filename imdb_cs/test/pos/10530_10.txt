Good job. Amazing actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters. All unforgettable parts in more than interesting and capturing thriller action. Casting is perfect. Both by the stars like Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the male gang member - Mustafa. You trust everyone from the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all the followers of white power. I admire the musical rhythm of the main theme "Children of Wax". This sound track is a charming blend of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kier humps? And at the same time, wax children "a story of racial conflict. Intolerance and brutality between skinheads and Turks."
