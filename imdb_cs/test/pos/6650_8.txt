I really enjoyed Minghella's epic, he thought he wasn't as much as "The English Patient". The first 20 minutes or so awkwardly, but as Inman (Jude Law) sets out on a journey back to his love of Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film takes on leaps and bounds and becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. It seems to be fashionable today to hate Kidman, but I do not agree at all, and here she is doing well. In fact, I think that the novel between Inman and Ada is poorly developed in the script (they really can't make it together to form a relationship), but the law and Kidman give them all that and persuade them. Ad's journey is the core of the film - it becomes a strong woman who can carry almost anything. Zellweger initially appears to be bad as Ruby but grows up and sparkles on you in many of her later scenes. The film has a beautiful photographic and scenographic design, but it never really catches on the true feeling of the period's work. Especially Jack White has long long hair and pale rocker skin that looks completely out of place. Cillian Murphy fans are looking forward to seeing a talented Irish actor in the early bit section, and Natalie Portman actually proves he can act in probably the most notable movie sequence. It is a pity that the "The Other Boleyn Girl" is so inadequate.
