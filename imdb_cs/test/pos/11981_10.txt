Don't let the 5.9 score you (from this writing on 12-8-02), this is one excellent movie. I can't understand how it happened to a rating that was so solid at all levels. Direction, acting, cinematography - all good. The story is interesting and original, and my only ink in understanding why rating is so fits in the fact that this is probably the type of movie people usually don't see. <br /> <br /> to play modern rock for 80 years. You can be young, raised and loved, but he or she was not and as a product of another time and taste - he does not care. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can handle more real people-based movies than those that consist of mindless actions, enormous fancy budgets and average talents, try next time you look at it. . <br /> <br />
