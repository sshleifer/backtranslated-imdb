One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end on December 31, 1999 at midnight. In "The Book of Life", writer / director Hal Hartley looks at the possible consequences of the new millennium of Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve,? 99. The story examines the role of the Son of God, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the book of Life (now contained in the Mac portable computer), which also includes the hundred hundred names. forty-four thousand good souls that will be saved on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P. J. Harvey), arrives in New York to prepare for his will, but begins to have second thoughts; must they judge both the living and the dead? Do they deserve what they have to challenge? It is a cup that he would rather not accept at this particular moment, which gives encouragement to Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who is afraid that the fruit of all his hard work is going to wash away at midnight because he can continue his work as long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. An artistically rendered high-concept film, Hartley, presents the story in an intelligent, provocative way, paying great attention to dealing with a sensitive subject so that the relentless fundamentalist is harmless. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is interesting and stimulating, as well as the influence of their presence on those they encounter during their physical stay in the city. It is a riveting meditation on the spiritual side of the fragile existence of man and contemplation of what has been prophesied in the Revelation of St. John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And in Hartley's approach to Second Coming there is logic; It maintains the contemporary aesthetics while taking advantage of the changed film speed that visually gives the film an ethereal quality. Christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie, mingled effectively with the population, while Satan's garment is somewhat more casual, his appearance somewhat neglected; bruises over the left eye. Donovan is well cast as Jesus, lending merciful names and a sense of limited urgency to his character, which is very effective. It is, of course, a unique image of the Savior and perhaps the best, because Max von Sydow is in the movie "The Greatest Story Ever Seen." It expresses a sense of inner peace and tranquility, which is the essence of the core of the character. And Ryan is deeply involved in the role of Prince of Darkness; It has a distinct way of speaking and resonating the quality of its voice, making it absolutely fascinating to watch. His eyes are a darkly penetrating feature that he uses effectively with clueless looks and captivating looks. He is the man who could sell you something for your soul before you ever knew what hit you. It is an unforgettable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus. The accompanying cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (True Believer), Katreen Hardt (lawyer assistant) and Anna Kohler (hotel official). In its own inimitable style, with the book "The Book of Life", Hartley has created a recent day perspective that is interesting, fun and truly unique. He has a way to capture life as it's just out of center, a method that works very well with such a movie. Quite short for a feature film (63 minutes running time), yet one of the best Hartley's and more than a ticket. It's a movie that will stay with you and maybe make you think about some of the things you could hide in the corner of your mind. And this is part of the attraction of this film; He realizes that "later" is most likely. I rate this 9/10.
