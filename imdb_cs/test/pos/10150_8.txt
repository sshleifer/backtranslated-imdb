Less than a thriller than a colorful adventure with thrilling elements, a person who was very fond of should not be compared to such masterpieces of Hitchcock as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; it is instead more similar to such pleasant romps as catching the theme and north of NORTHWEST. Filmed mainly in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently start to murder a conspiracy - and when their young son is kidnapped to insure their silence. James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their All-American Couple roles, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a Midwestern physician, is outgoing but has a touch of "ugly America abroad" on his personality; The day that plays the popular stage and the recording star that has gone into marriage is suspicious. These characteristics of personality and background play very well in the story. MAN WHO KNEW TOOCH contains many famous scenes; how the scene in which Stewart heals the day before telling her about the kidnapping and very complicated succession of Albert Hall, including what appears to be hundreds of cuts, is very strong. Less often he noticed, though to my mind as well, if not more satisfying, there are more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines the edge of tension with perverted humor, as Stewart tries to reveal himself in the shop of taxi drivers and daily lanes "Que Sera," Sera "(written for this film) the most appropriate way at the embassy cocktail party. Although a person who has seen that he has no power has no depth and the impact of the greater work of Hitchcock, he remains an entertaining film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
