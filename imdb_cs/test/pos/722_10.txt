I watched this movie that didn't know anything about it. I assumed it was a sci-fi movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The storyline is charming and intelligent, the cast is charismatic, and the whole movie is just thinking about change. Some of the puzzles totally surprised me, but in the end the answers were quite simple. I am quite confused about the low score of this movie as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or Matrix, then you will enjoy it. There are no great special effects or a fantastic trick. It's all about conspiracy, about building characters and building the atmosphere. It is a movie, but in the end it does not provide any answers that could irk some people, but I thought the end was great. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not .......
