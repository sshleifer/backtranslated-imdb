Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and finally found Jamie Foxx to play the title role. Foxx is amazing in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From the interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and both played the piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a small child and played piano in all his scenes). I haven't seen Karla live until his later years, so it was great to get a glimpse of how his career was developing. I hope Foxx will be nominated for Best Oscar Actor, as he deserves it. The music is also incredible - it's really an example of the breadth of Charles's music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The film also gives an undamaged account of Ray Charles's life, since many women have had relationships with his drug habit and the consequences of it.
