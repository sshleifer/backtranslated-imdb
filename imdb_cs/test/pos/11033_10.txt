This film is one of the best memories I have since childhood. Mom always loved me to see it. It's absolutely amazing. It's one of those movies that leave a lasting impression on you. The image of the tigers running through the snow, with all the splashes still in my head for about 25 years, not many movies proved it, as other comments say, that the photo is stunning. You must see. I also searched the film for some time without luck. :-(. Checks Amazon every now and then says nothing, or tells. If someone knows about a resource, contact me or send it here. Tim
