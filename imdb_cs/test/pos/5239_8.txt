I really liked this movie.it features John Wayne in his first play performance.even then you can tell Wayne has a real presence, though he would really mature for the icon he is known up to Stagecoach, 9 years later in 1939 This is about settlers from across the country heading for the New West to colonize it. Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins, but for his own personal reasons. the movie even more amazing. they managed to create credible, distinctive characters and there's a strange mix. Cimarron would come out a year later and have a very similar story, although I didn't like it the same as this movie For me, The Big Trail is strong 8/10.
