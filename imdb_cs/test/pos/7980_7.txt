With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in the American cinema: giving a blockbuster sequel. Three years after the most successful film of the year "Batman" (1989) here again comes the hero Gotham City for the enjoyment of many viewers. Like his predecessor, "Batman Returns" has enjoyed immense business success. Tim Burton came back again because he believes the victory of the second on his enemy Joker has little improved the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist, and here Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and Penguin (Danny De Vito) are the second. These two crooks, eager to take control of Gotham City, make Batman's life more difficult. His task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... Tim Burton added a lot of work to the scenery and seems to have tried to correct the mistakes of the first film. That is, the director has given way to combat sequences that are better handled than in Batman's first. But he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters. If in the 1989 movie Burton focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here's the penguin that obviously cares about him. The director tried for him, very well behaved De Vito, ambiguous character. On the one hand, it is full of bad intentions (previously cited), but on the other hand it seeks its past and would like to be considered a real man. "Batman Returns" also appears crazier than his predecessor, especially with the cast. I mean Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who offers bold and powerful performance like Catwoman. In addition, at the time of writing this review, I think that there is a new version of Catwoman at the moment. But due to bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that her performer Halle Berry must fade into meaninglessness next to Pfeiffer. Finally, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and allows for the development of Tim Burton's weird style. We can still find its taste on strange and gothic. As for Batman's other screen adjustments, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard Christopher Nolan shot at the beginning of Batman's story and was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton?
