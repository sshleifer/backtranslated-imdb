I am amazed and appalled by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get a Black Snake Moan point. It's not about black-and-white relationships or about old / young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer has deliberately cast both elements on the tunes of taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sexual dependence, although it is characterized by Christina Ricci's character, Rae. It's not about folk religion in the black community, although religion plays a big part. It's not a love story, even if there's not one but two happy couples at the end. And it is definitely not a south where "everything is warmer", even if it is in the south and undeniably hot; Saint smokes, even tag-line writers didn't get a point. Black Snake Moan is a parable of the Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they play, how they treat them. It is as if the film producers sat down with an empty slate and asked, "Okay, if we help people understand what the Blues is all about, how would it look?" "And so they put her south in the country. Then she dreams of two characters, one whose wife has left him to live with her best friend, the other who goes to war and his poorly abused girl sleeps with everyone in the city. the miserable secularity that little religion has touched (they know that Jesus wants their lives, and although they respect Him, they know they can't give it to him), some violence between men and women, lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including - Go over the top? - A black man in a sleeveless tank top who is holding a half naked white girl in captivity at the end of a 40 lb string. blues-man son house at both ends, and Voila - you have a modern parable about what the Blues is all about. The city is dancing steamy dances on hot, exciting blues. Of course, here's a little dilemma. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is cured by Lazar's (Jackson's) domestic religion and perseverance (and don't forget the string.) But then we showed that the renewed Rae was dancing raunchily on the blues to the end. Is it the expression of a renewed, healthy life force, or just more of the same delicate behavior that destroyed it in the first place? The brewer wants both, but the blues is really about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I would say that the blues would give a healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without it being released. I have my doubts. Samuel L Jackson plays so well for the first time that we forget watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is incredibly good. He even chooses some of his own melodies in the film and his playing is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually that good. It is true that half of her work is done by the Costume that was not there and her slinky, but it is a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability; Bravo came to her. I was amazed by the preacher of the country, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he's a professional actor and not a true country minister. Parents need to be aware of what's going to happen when their kids bring it home. The language is far enough from the charts, the first half hour is full of graphic sex, and women are tens of ways during the movie (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, by attaching a woman to a Radiator?) In addition, Ricci spends half of the film dressed for sex; If you have a teenage boy, they will lick the screen halfway through the movie. I do not recommend it for children of any age. Adult only, please. As already mentioned, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a story that is redeemable in many ways. It's unorthodox, but it's worth it. And, my God, the soundtrack is hot.
