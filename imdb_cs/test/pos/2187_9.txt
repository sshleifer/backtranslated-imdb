Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: DEMON BARBER FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury starring. Although it practically swept virtually any price that can be imagined, the box office did not reach expectations and the original production ceased to run at 557 performances. Fortunately, the game continued on tour - and was captured on film along the way. The result is a remarkable capture of the game featuring George Hern, replacing Caria, and Lansbury in close approximation of the original Broadway production. But there is a mistake. Simply put, plays do not film very well, as a performance that performs well on stage, has to fill the theater and is therefore very, very large - and when it is placed on a film, such performances often seem a bit static, aggressively aggressive, or both . . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen on the film, it has "stand and sing" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury appear to have modulated their performances due to camera interest such is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; her greater than life performance takes place in the film as unpleasantly frantic, and her extremely opera voice does not seem to be in place when she contrasts with the overall cast. however, this is a truly exceptional performance unique and macabrely comic musical in the style of operetta. Lansbury is overwhelming, a mixture of stupidity, stupidity and cunning, while Hern actually owns the role of a psychotic barber whose clients "go to the graves of impeccably shaved". The whole cast is pretty good, and although the movie doesn't allow us to see enough of the set, there's enough on the display to be impressive. And music! Who can argue with what Sondheim considers the best work? The story itself is very well known, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst put together several urban myths for a story he called STRING OF PEARLS; during the year or so it was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET - and at a time that knew little copyright, games were soon all over England. But each of them was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, the barber, kills the men who come to shave him; Mrs. Lovett, his companion, bakes them in a cake and feeds them on unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on the 1973 version of Christopher Bond. The story is very Grand Guignol, with lots of blood, bodies falling down slips, and grotesque humor; At the same time, the music, lyrics, and sub-pop of the innocent in the clutches of evil open the subject to numerous lyrical spells that one would not expect. Sondheim's texts are often ironic, but never more than here; Along the way, he intertwines a great deal of evil satire with the re industry and capitalism, and it certainly cannot be caused by the strange but Victorian elegant of his intricate music. <br /> <br /> As a "concert version" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also offers several selections that were cut out of the 2007 Tim Burton movie version, especially "Attend the Teen of" Sweeney Todd ". It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than a movie that tends to underestimate comedy in favor of an increasingly large blood show. Regardless of whether you're a fan of the story, it's a legendary Broadway tour show, and that's a knock-out. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
