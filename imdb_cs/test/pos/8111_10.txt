The Big Dictator is a premium movie. Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being extremely witty and funny, but at the same time providing a strong statement in his satire against fascism. Chaplin's anti-Nazi speech with its values ​​is one of the great moments of the film. In this film, I felt that there was some higher form of intelligence at work, beyond the truly intelligent filming.
