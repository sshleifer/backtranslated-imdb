a great movie, with a somewhat vague political message. is filmed in theater style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. the mayor of raw materials and ashcroft diana seem to be just as suspicious. emotions are high because Western tourists and entrepreneurs seem reluctant and unable to give up the mayor's East-Russian magic, although they make every effort to understand their point of view. two opposing views of the world are clearly expressed, but the film also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. his powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact on the film of the 1950s.
