It took years for the iconic Bruce Campbell icon to get into this project - but finally, it's here - and what a great deal of fun it is! Looking at the plot; it sounds like two things. A great base for a very stupid B-movie and a shameless apology for Bruce Campbell doing his best - grotesque Evil Dead II-style humor and this film brings on both counts. The screaming man is a nonsense of comics to the end - but there are really great scenes and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell has written, directed, produced and starred in this film - and although he is not entirely a Kane citizen, it has to be said to be a success for a man who is best known for fighting his own hand in a forest cabin. The story is followed by American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. But the trip is angry when his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; thanks to the same woman. Mad Scientist Stacy Keach is on hand to connect Cole and the taxi driver's brain into one; and we have a cult swing on us. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is fun and contains some laughter; but once the main plot point was made; the movie really gets up. Bruce makes best use of scenarios in all kinds of stupid situations, from changing clothes in a waste bin to making a decision (with a taxi driver in the brain) to eat in a restaurant. Humor is usually a grotesque variety, and anyone who has enjoyed Evil Dead II (whoever should have seen it) will surely enjoy it. He feels that Campbell is playing a bit too much of his strength with this whole project, but if you tune in and don't see Bruce do what he does best, disappointment will follow. Besides, no disrespect for men; but he was never the greatest actor. Despite a lot of fun; the film is not great, as sometimes a little silly; and there is a whole sub-fence with a robot that I didn't like; but overall, the Man with the Screaming Brain is a movie that we unfortunately do not see much today. The film is ubiquitous, not holding wasted, B-film; and it deserves respect if nothing else.
