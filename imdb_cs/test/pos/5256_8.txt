Women are a cute film about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their questions in life. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, time to connect with others, problems with image, compromise values, success in life and find what really pleases you. It's also about being faithful. Many times, people give you advice, but they don't actually control it yourself. Sometimes they have created a deception for yourself and should you really follow the same path or respond to your feelings? I really liked this movie. It is true that sometimes it was like being Sex & the City, but that probably helped me. The difference is that it is like discoveries after the life stage in which Sex & the City stars - most of them married or in the past, trying to find a man. Now he is trying to find happiness in his marriages and lives. Apparently it's not an Oscar, but it's fun and serves its purpose. And for men there, there was the same proportion of men and women in the cinema (most was with their wives / girlfriends), and the men were actually laughing. :)
