I noticed that a lot of people were taking opera on the task of Betty reacting to the murders. I think these complaints are based on how he would imagine that a "normal" person would react. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person because of childhood traumatic events. She's in trouble before the movie starts ... and by the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... has become totally upset. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You should keep in mind that when she was a very young child, she witnessed her mother loves to commit at least one brutal murder while her mother did Sadomasochistka looks at it. She was brought up by a woman who achieves sexual relaxation tied up by watching girls get hacked, slashed and strangled to death. This does not mean a healthy home life. I think it is quite easy to conclude that her mother would employ all kinds of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never pulled her out. It is also likely that in her impressive age Betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw. It's just something adults do, etc. Betty apparently looks up to her mother ... I mean, she's an opera singer just like her. If your mother likes it, it can't be bad, it can ... mommy can't be bad, right? She couldn't tell the police about her mother or this mysterious little boy with her mother. Betty has many deep-seated emotional problems. Her mind has been trying for years to block the memory of what her mother saw ... but she still comes to the surface, manifested in the form of terrible nightmares, migrating skulls, throbbing migraines, dependence on relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity. bloody death with sex on the subconscious level. There's an internal struggle between the part of Betty that confuses murder / sex and her part that believes these things are wrong. After seeing his friend murdered by a hooded man ... he calls the police but is not willing to give his name. The part that thinks murder is wrong forces her to call, but the part that is ambivalent doesn't allow her to admit personal participation. The ambivalent part takes control of it before it can go all the way. So she leaves the phone in the rain ... and when she is picked up by the director, she looks surprisingly calm, not as upset as she would think a "normal" person was ... because her part has been blocking things since then, what she was a child is trying to bloody block the horror of what she is witnessing. The situation in her life contributes to a dead end in Betty's psyche. Her singing career begins to bear fruit ... it will be a great opera singer like her mother. Will she be the same as her mother in every way? In darker ways? Or will she be able to make her own way? Add it to the re-emerging hooded man who murdered everyone around her. It's not until the hooded man kills Darie Nicolodi's character, who really takes Betty's active role in defeating the killer. Here's someone who loves Betty, who unreservedly supported her in her emerging career, which in fact is the mother figure in Betty's life because Mum is dead. Imagine how horrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see a woman who is the closest thing to a mother to shoot with her eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I used to. The essence of what I say is that the Betty character is much more complex than most reviewers willing to admit. Opera is one of the best Argento ... and not just for the visuals themselves (though they are truly spectacular) and not just for inventive murders (even if they are). There is depth ... and attention needs to be paid.
