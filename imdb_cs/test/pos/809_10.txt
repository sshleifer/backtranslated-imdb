In a better civilization, this and many other David Suchet films would be released in theaters. The land is wonderful (no, I have no idea who did it, but the tracks were all if I was more imaginative - the best kind of secret), stunning production values, acting (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and David Suchet Hercule Poirot) just perfect, dialogue is amazing, music and the feeling of tension and tension are just amazing things. One of the pleasures of these films by Hercule Poirot for Men is how many beautiful women they play! Here were two - sexy sinuous Megan Doods and stunning Lysette Anthony. You really can't break the rental of these - they're just beautiful - as the most beautiful dinner in the most beautiful restaurant with the most sophisticated company you can imagine - your mind is always working because it's all there and you are fighting but By constantly thinking about your mind, you can keep up with everything - and set a gorgeous one. I can't think about movies that stimulate thoughts more than Hercule Poirot / David Suchet. It is impossible to praise them - and a few months ago I never saw or read Agatha Christie.
