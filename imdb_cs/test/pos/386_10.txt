"Foreigners on the train" was one of those movie classics I always heard of, but I never got to him. Finally, I watched it a few weeks ago, and, as with any Hitchcock movie, it not only passed the time trial, but far exceeded most of today's thrillers. You can see inspiration for future action movies here - the top ending out-of-control merry bike-wheel and two villains dueling each other reminded me of the great action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's "Speed". "Of course," Strangers "is over forty years older than" Speed ​​"and contains no modern special effects, but visceral excitement is there - Hitchcock was a real genius. <br /> <br /> No-so-subtle Bruna gay party (Robert Walker in amazing performance) took the form in many other psycho-stalker-numbers in future movies. Let's take him for the male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He knows about Guy before he meets him on the train - it almost seems to us that their contact is not random - and soon becomes obsessed with him. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the elements of Oedipial in his films (also see "Psycho" for more obvious undertones) and there is a lot of it Here, Bruno hates his father and wants him to die to be with his mother, and his effeminate manner and apparent homosexuality had to slip away in 1951 when the gays were not "allowed" to be displayed on the screen - and yet Hit chcock sends a message effectively when we see Bruno in the phone lounge who wears a very non-masculine robe, flirts with Guy and reacts to his mother. The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller before you can come back over and over - unfortunately it's reworked as a big-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original I can't imagine anything overcome the sheer excitement of the white joint of this film.
