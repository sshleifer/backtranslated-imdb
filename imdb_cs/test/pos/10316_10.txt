There are one or two other era shorts that I like more (ie SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think we can say - without much argument - that in this particular episode Shemp gives its greatest comedy performance as a break after returning the team in 1946 Scene scene, this episode barely dismisses: from Professor Shemp Howard's voice to Dee Green's glass shake, to his futile attempts to win a dame hand in marriage (that's your little snookums ... you'll get married with me * click *) for excitement, I never fail to keep me in the stitch. I'd be sure I shouldn't mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (always beautiful Christine McIntyre). Btw, isn't she more dressed and enthusiastic when she greets a man she thinks is her cousin? Who knows, maybe the real Basil was a "very" distant cousin who makes him legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
