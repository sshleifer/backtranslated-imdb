This film is well cast, often stupid and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau are working on their magic team to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a revolt as an egoistic boss of the tour director. From the first "hare krishna" to the last "you should pay him fifty dollars for calling you two studs," I thought it was a fun comedy
