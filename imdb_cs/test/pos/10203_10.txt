Here's another of the 1940s westerns I watch whenever it comes to TCM or FMC because although it may be historically wrong, it's very fun and well behaved, plus it's Randolph Scott, my favorite actor, second to Gary Cooper-Well, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. However, the film is just as historically accurate for me, and as I said earlier, it behaved well and "flows" very well - I bet I saw it 50 or 60 times, and I enjoy watching more than the previous one. I got it on a TCM tape, but I'd buy it in a minute if it ever appeared on a DVD. Look, if you don't - I guarantee you like it!
