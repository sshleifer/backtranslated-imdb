After seeing this movie, I found out that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This film would not be observable without Drew. The fact that someone as attractive as Drew could really scare me and did when she was "Josie Grossie". Her attempts to "pace" as the girls called, were cheerful, especially when she was trying to dance in a nightclub. We also had a SNL favorite, Molly Shannon, playing a big role as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the most entertaining scenes in the film was Anita, who was trying to teach class sex. That was one of Mollys' most successful performances and the best. Leelee Sobieski also had a big role and I really felt for her because I know people like her who were so tortured. This film is to be seen by Drew Barrymore fans because Drew is making a movie.
