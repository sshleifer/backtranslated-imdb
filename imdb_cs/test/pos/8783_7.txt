Writers Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and (all) Dorothy Parker allow director Alfred Hitchcock to explain what might have been his favorite movie theme. Hitchcock, who has some merit in creating the story, constructs a great deal of tension in the plot of the warehouse worker who blamed the blast that killed his best friend; he sets out on a journey to find a real culprit. Lots of excitement on a large scale, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter), does a surprisingly great job. Even the ever-smug Robert Cummings gets into the right spirit! *** of ****
