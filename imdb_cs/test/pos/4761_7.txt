**** SPOILERS **** Buried under the mountain of medical bills and his burial business that couldn't dig him out of his mind, Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, came up with a plan to make cash. help his two crooked friends Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. Vito is approaching his childhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a crowd informant who has won over Buddy's confidence and told him what Vito is doing on the streets of New York with respect to crowd activities. Buddy is a cop who works in sub rosa to unite the NYPD, seven ups who do things "their way" to clear New York City street criminals. Vito gets information from Buddy and does it to look at Buddy that he really gives him tips on the crowd and what's up there, too, and uses that information to pick up his Moon colleagues and Bo to rip the mobsters out of their weekly take, as well as kidnap the top crowd of shark loans and hold them for ransom. Everything is fine for Vito & Co until the crowd decides to retaliate and accidentally catches beats and kidnappings a member of Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who has worked in secret thinking that he is one of those who is kidnapped and torn. Later Ansel was accidentally killed by the Moon when he blasted the trunk of a car that Ansel was locked in thinking that there was a trunk full or cash, ransom, in it. Fast pace and exciting movie with the brave and dirty New York photo that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection", which also plays Roy Scheider & Tony Lo Bianco, who are also in this film. The incredible chase behind the car, which started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the New Jersey wilderness about 15 to 20 miles away with Buddy almost ended up in the decoupage for his heroic efforts. Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as hard and efficient as any big action actor I could think of as if he were Clint Eastwood in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, even looks a bit like him, a former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who in 1957 defeated the brilliant Sugar Ray Robinson in a medium weight championship and in the movie he acts like him: hard and durable. Tony Lo Bianco is very good as Vito, who cares about the low heel life that he plays with Buddy and the crowd to the point of killing Buddy's friend. Though it is a waste, you cannot in some way justify Vito because it only wants the money it gets from the torn mobsters to pay the hospital to their sick wife Rose and medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but just as they say when you play with fire you end up being burned. Finally, Vito explains a lot about what to do with such insensitive and caring gangsters. <br /> <br /> "The Seven Ups" has the late Bill Hickman, who makes dangerous stunts with the pursuit of cars and also in the movie. Hickman was also a sensational man in both great movies that led him to the streets of highways and roads in New York and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
