I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, that's a great movie. Real-husband and wife Paul Bettany and star Jennifer Connelly as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggles written and the decision to publish the "origin of the species". Their reflections on the consequences they may have for their family and the future of mankind are transmitted in such a way that one of them suspects that only the off-screen couple could reach. Jon Amiel (who gave the heart - felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent work to bring Randal Keynes' biography. They created some very annoying and human moments, great cinematography and ensembles and generous help of language-in-face about the ever-dividing theory of evolution. The surprising star is Martha West, who plays Annie Darwin, a character that tells many stories. She plays a premature young girl on the tee. If this show is anything that its star should play, it should be on the rise. All in all a great movie, and even though it is a period that is very much a live topic at the moment.
