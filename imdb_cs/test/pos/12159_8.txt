There was a political document, a recent year, called Why We Fight, which tries to explore the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. It is believed to be polemic and initiating when we oppose this complex and the war fiasco we are currently dealing with in Iraq. An even more famous series of films with the same name was created during World War II by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although these are Oscar-winning documentaries in this category, this series of seven films is truly a mere agitprop, more in the spirit of the triumph of Leni Reifenstal, whose Capra scenes are recycled for their own purposes. This means that this does not mean that it has no fundamental information that the lack of a generation of two World War II documentary films (such as the BBC praised by the World in War) lacked, nor does it mean, that its value as a primary source is slightly less valuable. They are skillfully made, and after the recent purchase of some used DVDs in the discount store, I found myself with the option to choose my free DVD with my purchase. I chose four DVDs from the Goodtimes DVD series. It rarely has anything that was so invaluable. While there are no extras on the DVD and the sound quality of the prints is different, these films provide insight into the minds of the Americans two-thirds a century ago when racism was apparent (as in many classic Warner Brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with the obvious distorting facts. Seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are the prelude to war, the Nazi Strike, Part and Conquer, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of Russia, the Battle of China, and the War come to America. Overall, the film series is worth watching, not only for obvious reasons, but also for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for expressions like X million when referring to dollars rather than modern singular, or most exaggerated, graphics throughout the series - a Japanese sword penetrating the center of Manchuria. At the same time, it shows the complexity of efforts to apply past standards to current wars. The lessons of the First World War (avoiding foreign involvement) were not applicable to World War II, whose own lessons (acting early against dictatorships) were not applicable in the three major wars that America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam, Iraq. The fact that many of this series meets with the uncertainties of the time it was made in will only underscore its historical value in today's information - clogged times. It may not help you solve the truth of lies and propaganda today, but at least you realize that you are not the first to be in such a difficult position, nor will you be the last.
