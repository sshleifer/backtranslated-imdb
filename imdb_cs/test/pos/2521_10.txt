For the first time I saw this VHS masterpiece 10 years ago and a powerful interpretation of the angry-kid-painfully-anti-based-society that he has been carrying in my heart ever since. Director Hector Babenco is such a good humanity that finds a gentle angle to tell the story of how urbanita kills childhood children from the class of poverty. Even frightened children have their innocent beautiful dreams. But corrupt reality never gives a chance ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to publishers for the latest DVD release, I can now keep this great movie in my favorite collection.
