The Royal County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian friend, Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in an area where a large dam is to be built; However, Noel is not willing to give up his country and will have to fight the dam company to prevent the County from any possible destruction. "Where the River Spreads North" is a breathtaking, contemplative story fueled by the unforgettable performances of Ripa Torna (recently seen in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in an understatement "Marie Antoinette" Sofia Coppola) and Tantoo Cardinal ("Wolves Dance", "Smoke Signals"). Director Jay Craven (who also wrote the screenplay with Don Bredes, based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel) and cinematographer Paul Ryan created this powerful story with a unique contemplative pace / visual image that reminds me of the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. It's an underestimated independent period piece of the first (electrical) mid-1990s, usually considered to be the rise of Quentin Tarantino's burlesque ("Pulp Fiction" is really a masterpiece, but one suffers from Orson Welles syndrome); in the UK (let's not mention that "Beach" is swinging with DiCapri) ... Jay Craven should also be more perceived on the list of big independent filmmakers. He led a respectful, discreet career and is always pleased to see a constant talent like his. My vote: 8/10.
