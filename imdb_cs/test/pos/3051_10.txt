If you're a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star is good oldie. What more can you want than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of good ridin 'and shootin' !!! I found it amazing that Duke's vocal voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Brother Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin Bill Could have been as well. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this. We do not have to be interested in hidden meanings or try to find out basic topics. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the Western movie from a simpler day and time. Her name is fun people !!!
