After reading the horrible reviews of this movie, including comments said it is quoted from Colin, I hardly bothered to add this movie to my Firth Film collection, but be a Firth Fan that I, the intrigue made me better! To my surprise, I enjoyed the movie very much. She had the tension, drama and intrigue, and the V.sexy Colin scene. The story really argued me to the end of the credits and I felt that when someone got past the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens, the actress played her role convincingly. Colin was as brilliant as never before and his great to see him play a "dark side" character, "chill went over my back" and after watching it I can't wait to see Colins' last movie "Trauma'soon". to DVD. OK, maybe it wasn't a movie that was almost "on the face" and you couldn't "sleep on the plot", especially towards the end, because there was a lot going on, but that was what I liked it, acting was subtle, fortunately it wasn't exaggerated (like many thrilling thrillers), which made the film cooler. All he could not guess was what Colins character (Ross Talbert) or for that matter Jennifer Rubens character (Jamie Harris) was going to do next, and there were quite a few surprises in the store, I sat on the edge of my seat all over her hands, with pillow at hand !! Personally, I am very happy to have followed the 'Playmaker' and I will surely rewind and again. I think every Firth Fan fan could benefit from this movie if they didn't like the plot and then just watch Colin ;-)
