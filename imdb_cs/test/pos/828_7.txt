It is really good to see that Van Damme's film is slowly improving, especially when compared to the C-grade "Derailed" and "Second in command" flops, which were tragic and not in a good way. Sheperd: Border Patrol is a good action movie with some really great action / combat sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to dig because his latest movie "Do Death" had no martial arts at all !!! As already mentioned, this film is significantly worse than "Until Death", which was a really good turn for Van Damme. "Until Death" lacked over-top-action from most of Van Damme's movies, but was dark and daring, and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that movie. Still, Shepherd is definitely a movie worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just for action movie fans in general, but if you're looking for a movie with a little more story ..... you might want to skip this movie! <br /> <br /> I think this movie was created pretty well, especially on what little budget it would be filmed. The only real problem with this film is the title; "Shepherd"? I do not get it! I suppose "Border Patrol" just doesn't have the same circle as "Shepherd" in front of him !!! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie is 7 out of 10, but that's the Van Damme Movie Standards in no other movie category. ie It's good for Van Damme.
