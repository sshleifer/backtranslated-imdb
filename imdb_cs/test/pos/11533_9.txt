The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years ago. There he meets his sister's former friend and together they travel to all the places where the nurse went, and the reasons are gradually clarified. But what makes this movie so special and soaring over a limited plot are beautiful characters. Although a friend of the older sister is a discarded hippie, she has noble ideals, moral standards, and incredible powers. And although the older sister we see in memories shares these ideals, there is no sense of limitation or balance, how much is too much. And although the younger girl is sharply loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was a normal girl after all. The most special moment in the movie is when a young girl and sister's sister finally stop fighting each other. I can't remember when I saw a more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in making love in the movie! <br /> <br /> In all these ways, it's a really beautiful movie, a movie to be valued, and one that can be seen again and again. 9 of 10.
