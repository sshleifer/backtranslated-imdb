Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the "real" FEMALE PRISONER films, as it is the latest in Shunya Ito's series, followed by another director's film (GRUDGE SONG). I haven't seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon it will be ...) so I don't know how it stacks on previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended has not left much room for another predecessor - but I think I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This Scorpion record is on the run from the cops where they hook up with a street hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded baby brother (oh yeah - that's not a lie ... I have to love these slim storylines). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old opponent, but (as well ...) ends up escaping and revenge on some people who broke a few of her hookers ... <br /> <br /> I agree with some other reviewers that this is a bit slower in points and more "more serious" than the previous two. The story is somewhat confusing and occasionally intricate, but a lot of those seventies of the tiny movies era are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE lacks bad enough in the area of ​​nudity, which was quite disappointing - but I thought it was strong in other areas - story, cinematography, some good sleaze, etc ... Definitely worth the fans of this kind of things or who enjoyed more films FEMALE PRISONER ... 8/10
