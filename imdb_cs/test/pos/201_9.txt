Real masterpiece of Soviet cinema. It's a pity for the Soviet Union that Samojlova never got the chance to play in Western movies - but then she would probably never be there. The "Let Zhuravli" is unforgettable. It was one of the few films I was crying to ... <br /> <br /> In addition to Samojlov, Batalova and Merkurjeva, who were top-notch, it was a great work of the director and operator who made it a feature classics around the world. Just remember the scenes of piano music and the design under heavy German bombing, or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head, and his last vision seemed blurred in these skies. Very simple means - but great technique added to the emotional weight ... Remember 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years ago "Titanic", and with the Soviet budget.
