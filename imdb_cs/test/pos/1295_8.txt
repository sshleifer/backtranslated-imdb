When I saw other Bollywood flicks with Salman Khan in them, I can say it's my favorite of the last. The song is quite entertaining, especially "About Priya O Priya", which seems to have a nice mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I dare say it) a bit of a Prince. Love stories are a little more believable than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. Occasionally focusing on Prem's use of alcohol is sometimes disturbing because it does not seem to make sense to me, but Khan plays well - even when his voice becomes whistling when he shows drunkenness.
