This film was an excellent, excellent director and overall had a great story. Ive had a real boy experience like 'Radio'. On a football program in my town, every year a mentally disabled boy has had a practice, travel and fun with a football team. This movie is really true and I can identify with it 100%. A boy like "Radio" must feel that he belongs to something; they must feel their life worth living. That's how 'Radio' feels and that's why this type of program is set up in my high school. This is a very moving movie that was happy to be featured on the big screen. My dad and I loved it and I always remember it, I'm a movie that tells a stunning story about the goodness and kindness of man!
