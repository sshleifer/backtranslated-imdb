1904. The Moroccan North African nation hangs on a hazy independence because various European powers - France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - are competing for influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is manipulated by the French and the Germans, is a real power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), Rif Leader and "Last of the Pirates of Pirates" to kidnap an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and her two children and take them hostage. Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) in the United States threatens to go to war: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - To see the problem as the perfect way to apply your Big Stick diplomacy, though Foreign Secretary John Hay (John Huston) is not so confident. However, Raisuli has less sinister plans for Pedecarises, who are more than capable of mastering themselves in any case. John Milius is a great historical film, based VERY loosely away from the true story (ie Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is an amazing bit of escape. He has several stunning action scenes, a humorous, well-written script, a delightful cast enjoying the material and not exceeding his welcome, such as "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "The Lord of the Rings". It's not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever created. While the historical context is uncertain, the plot is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more relevant today than it was when it was made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - wild, strong, but a little blind and at times ruthless. By the time the film was taking place, America had been absorbed on the world stage as a superpower following their strong victory in the Spanish-American war - and Roosevelt seized this incident as a way to prove America's prize. It didn't work out in real life, but it works well allegorically. While written from a right-wing perspective, Milius's script is quite accurate in considering America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his method of "big wand" diplomacy and rightly recognizes (according to Roosevelt) that while America can fear and respect, it will never really be "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. And there are some scenes such as Roosevelt's European leaders' target shooting and the almost comical surprise attack of the Marines on Bashaw's Palace - which shows an American ruthless and violent side, while others - a climactic battle with the Germans - show their heroism. Of course, the historical / political context of the film is merely the meat on the bones of what is essentially an exciting action / adventure film. There are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as Raisuli's Rescue Pedecaris is from double-cruising tribes, which features some of the best swordplay in any movie. The open entry of the Raisuli and the above-mentioned march and the attack of the US Marine Corps are brilliantly executed brilliant pieces. And the last battle that combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while the main historical fantasy (three-way battle between Germans, Americans and Rifs) is a superbly staged, adrenaline pump sequence. <br /> <br /> The superb cast gives some amazing performances. Everyone seems to have a fun time with the film and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as Berber with a Scottish accent, but he succeeds in detaching his interesting, well-cherished and knightly character that respects his hostages and renounces a modern, uncultural war. Candice Bergen, an actress I never liked, gives great performance as the wild Eden Pedecaris, which is as hard as her captor. Brian Keith is an incredibly persuasive TR - you really feel that he must have been such an athletic, tumultuous but practical and intelligent person with an admirable sense of self. Roosevelt boxing scenes and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the biggest "bad asses" in the history of the film - and who can forget the lines like "Why spoil the beauty of the lawful thing"? John Huston provides solid support as a tired, careful Hay, acting as a perfect foil for a much more impulsive Roosevelt. Among the gentle accompanying cast is the best Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, a cynical ambassador caught in the middle of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly as a gung-ho Marine Captain, who cheerfully defends (and performs) "Military intervention!" as a blunt and simple solution to a complex situation. Other familiar faces like Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty are also doing a great job, no matter how small their role is. Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("Fistful of Dynamite") as German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of the Raisuli tribes. <br /> <br /> "Wind and Lion" is a beautifully made adventure film all around. He has something for everyone: a wonderful weapon and fencing, a lot of humor, a harsh, wild heroine (and her two cute kids), a nice (if not consumed) romance and an interesting (if fantastic) political-historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn't trying to be. I give "Wind and Lion" for nine stars and my highest recommendation.
