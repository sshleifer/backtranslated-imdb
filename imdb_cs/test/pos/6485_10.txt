"... the rhythm is too strong ... we are now deaf mutants - just like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film was evenly thrown away. Let me be the first to really talk about "The Beat" and why YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW. Don't be mistaken, this movie is cheesy and "bad" in the conventional sense: The story is pointless, poetry is stupid and acting is inconsistent. But these are CHARMS - all of these ingredients form a recipe for one of the most detailed films of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf mutants" does not raise your interest, then it may be: What is the name "Rex Voorhas Ormine"? It's such an unusual name (for the North American audience) I thought, "Even the names of the characters in this movie are" stupid ". <br /> <br /> Well," The Beat "is so wonderful cheezy that" meaning "and" symbolism "for" Rex Voorhas Ormine "is revealed by not-too-subtly Bart Waxman (misleading counselor likes to hate) .I won't spoil revelation behind Rex's name, but don't be too excited, OK? Overall, acting is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays "concerned teacher" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, just like a colleague playing Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast is unconvincing), which means that the actor does NOT translate the movie. The actors are SINCERITY, which makes the characters they play, cute, although the performances may suck, you still have the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best, with the result that the actor's sincerity will succeed where their acting fails often). <br /> <br /> Tribute "poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But it's good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Would you really enjoy "better quality" or "more decent" poetry - especially in a movie like this? People who would be BORING (think about what they do to us that we read in high school - -sititized to avoid "youth corruption", politically conservative and lacking critical analysis, etc.) \ t Although you don't like poetry or "arty" films (with all the "intellectual" attitudes that implies), you certainly (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in WANNABE ART FILM !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? "Do you remember the dinosaur roar? The woman is Scottish craps on the wrong scotty floor, oh the woman is so sad she wash her hands and then she waits for the door today, yeah - today!" <br /> Yes, this is an example of some remarkable poetry that freely sprinkled on "The Beat". But what about the story, you ask? Well, the story is meaningless. But then it's the beauty of this movie. In addition to some clich√©s, stereotypes and predictable conspiracies, there are plenty of truly unique elements on the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate Angels? Does Billy and Kate really understand what Rex is saying? Does the audience understand Rex and his poetry? (I've seen the movie several times and I still haven't come up with it all.) <br /> <br /> Will bad poetry and talent in high school really show END GANG VIOLENCE? I guarantee you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - the perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre yet honest gameplay, and "mytopoetics conquers gang violence" a story to be still RIVALED ANYTHING FILM EVER MADE. <br /> <br /> Bonus for NYC hardcore fans: Cro-Mags make a rare film look like "Iron Skulls" and it's a hurry, as you can see a few songs. I wish they included more concert shots, but maybe it will be "extra" on the DVD "Collector's Edition" that I fantasize about. <br /> <br />
