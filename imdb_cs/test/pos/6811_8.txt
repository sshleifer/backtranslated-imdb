The first in a new style of movies for Lamas - no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I miss one for one. But this is a serious movie. He plays an FBI profile that has lived with bad guys in the head for so long that they don't trust anyone, including themselves. Gary Busey is either a great actor, or someone I don't want to meet in a broad daylight on a crowded street. Kristen Cloke watches Lamas as he watches the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not least of which is the end. It never seems to come - the story always has one more layer. Cloke and Lamas begin as good guys, turn into bad guys and somehow end heroes. But it's definitely worth the rental price. For maximum enjoyment throw in a stick, bag of popcorn and soft drink. You go to the movies!
