This is such a fun and fun movie. Highly fun at all angles. It features a bizarre array of unforgettable, psychotic, but nice nuts. We have; Judge, Sargent, child, scary old lady, whore, clown. Unfortunately, they all live in a big house that has no locks and a lack of staff. So for our pleasure we see them running, playing games and being dangerous. We also learn on the way ... never give your patient an ax! It was in front of Cukkos's nest and overcomes it. At least on a fun level. He even has his sweet moments. "Love is pure. Love is grace. Love is power. You love me, your love is pure, you will always love me." Who could resist it? Nuts are also humans. Just a few loose wires. Be a little careful, or you'll have an ax at the back! Children in the game. Hehe. The man on the phone repair was really funny and his reaction to the nuts and bitter boss was really real. All the characters in this movie are extremely well played. And I really found them funny. No, HILARIOUS! They can even give you dirty thoughts how you can use them. Or how they can use you. This is actually a very clever movie. There is a brilliant twist end. I have to say I expected it to be good, but they never expected THIS. It's scary. "The court has decided. You're no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so, so perfect ... you'll throw a tear. I'm so excited about seeing such a movie. I'll never forget it. It's not just a cult ... it's a cult CLASSIC. Whatever you do ... Don't look into the basement !!!
