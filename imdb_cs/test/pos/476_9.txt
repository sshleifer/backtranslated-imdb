"My Dinner with Andre" from 1980 with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory is essentially a dialogue about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005 'You Are Alone' shows how common secular events can break the soul. The story revolves around three main characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who is worried by virtually every decision in her life. Then there's a prostitute, or a paid escort, Britney, confident when Daphne is confident. Interestingly, they have the same body, if not the same person. Part of this film's magic is set in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches the door in an old hotel room. He stops and is apparently torn by the decision to knock on the door? But it's Britney, who slips effortlessly into the room when the door opens. On the other side of the door is Buddy, nobody of middle age who has little, if any, personal qualities that anyone might find attractive. He goes so far as to be confrontational about the chosen Britney profession once he enters the room. However, we will soon learn that Buddy is a neighboring neighbor to Daphne and has watched over the years how she has grown from a little girl to a woman. This complicates viewers' things. Is Buddy a concerned neighbor or does he want something else? If it is sex that Buddy wants, here it is. Britney loves sex. Her definition may be Clintonesque, but it does not detract from her enthusiasm. He prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic bracelets to choose from. Each color group indicates a specific act to play? but exactly which act is not revealed until the band breaks away from the wrist and the choice is irrevocably executed. Britney is, or believes, to be in control of each meeting. Although blindfolded and blindfolded by one of her regular clients, she imagines that her arms and body are caressed by several men, but her legs and pubic are stroked by a woman in red lingerie. The images of the movie are still coming. Buddy's poor life is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fantasies about a pretty teenager next door. It is no coincidence that Daphne or Britney lured this hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of the food plate, leaving only the fish head. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; All good parts are completed. So this is where he brought his wife when they were college students, doing his booth? regain some control over your own life, make its statement. Director 'You Are Alone', Gorman Bechard, knows his craft. The main event in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, with countless scenes that add dimension to characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the movie progresses, Britney asks Buddy if she should undress. He says yes, but he just undresses on underwear. A real prostitute would probably remove all her clothes (one in five professions). But it's not Buddy who's conquered. As the film ends, we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in the game. Scary doesn't work if it doesn't. Britney does it, just like 'You Are Alone'.
