Regardless of the disadvantages and shortcomings of the film mentioned by other viewers, I have to say that it seemed to me that this was a film about power, which in my opinion is one of the most charming illusions. I saw the drama of the emperor and the people. It seems to me that the director was wondering what the nation's contribution is and what the price of "happiness" is for everyone. Is there a justification for forced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be forfeited for the security and peaceful existence of a nation? Is the idea of ​​a mighty wannabe empire worthy of limiting poverty and killing thousands of its citizens? It seems to me that the Emperor himself does not know the answer and tries to teach her the whole time the movie is running. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically bothered by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate half of his subjects for having to give up his father and his love, half to love people as a good emperor. No wonder his actions are controversial and the emotions are confused. It seems to me that, as another film presenting the problem of human power over other men, the film is successful.
