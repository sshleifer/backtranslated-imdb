My girlfriend, after a cold London dinner in Leicester Square, after the movie, says: If they don't speak English and don't show the stadium, you might think they were slums in a South American town or some other slum anywhere in the world, not Queens in New York. Ramin Bahrani is, now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work not to show the OTHER face of the American, but the REAL face of America. Ramin Bahrani's films are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop shop is a reality transformed into a movie, more realistic than a documentary, in fact, I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documents. This is a great movie, but don't expect any chase for a car or shooting. This film is about the tragic lives on the edge of the richest, richest country in the world.
