I'm still waiting for the new DVD release of this amazing movie for years. I own a beta record with FRENCH. Unfortunately, MGM misses the French track on his recent DVD ... He just spoke French subtitles ... I don't know how to deal with MGM: I wrote them e-mails, but of course no answer. If I insist, it's because, exceptionally, the French dubbing track was spectacular, fun, well-written, and so on. Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help ...
