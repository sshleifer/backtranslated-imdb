It can be hard to explain how this film is a masterpiece. Maybe because I never imagined that such a story or film with such small words could convey this poetry. True poetry and aristocracy of human passion and obsession. Bogard is amazing and no need to say that Venice is used as a perfect scenery: dark, sunken and grim as well as Bogard's soul. And classical music is rather a simple background that accompanies human feelings. In my opinion, it is a classic masterpiece of European filmmaking.
