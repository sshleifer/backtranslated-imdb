I watched this movie for lack of anything else. The film quickly caught me with the depth of the characters and the gentle plot. I was quite surprised to find that the rating provided by my satellite provider showed no stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give any spoilers per line or result, but most characters have at least some values. Until the last moment I didn't know how it would end. You can often pick up the formula and predict the direction of the story. I couldn't do this with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it as one of the finest films of this genre.
