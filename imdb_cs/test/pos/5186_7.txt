This is a catastrophic film in London. Starting a multiple hurricane, superstorm, and tornado on Scotland are moving toward the east, descending the coast of England and later south. After a few hours of heavy rain, the London barrier over the Thames is short of running, and it paves the way for disaster. Then the colossal tidal wave is inexorably declining eastward, causing the millions of London's people to be devastated and endangered. In the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist trying to save London from the effects of a giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city dam is dangerous, then a naval engineer (Robert Carlyle) and his ex. Wife of Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in a barrier and fall into the sea. Meanwhile, the secret government agency HQ controlled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under the direct command of the Deputy Minister (David Suchet) is trying to control many displaced people and avoid more dead, approximately 200,000. They have little time to save London from total disaster. <br /> <br /> A perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with all right. Magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts the catastrophe and outstanding Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as a former marriage that revives their love. The film features impressive flood scenes that have revived breathtaking computer-generated special effects generators, better than the 70's, such as "Earthquake, Inferno Towering," and "Armaguedon and Day after tomorrow." Although this is not a clear statement, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and the global warming created by the ozone hole. The film is directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who like catastrophic movies. Other flood modifications are as follows: "Flood (1976)" directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard Rain (1998)' directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: River Rampage (1979)' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
