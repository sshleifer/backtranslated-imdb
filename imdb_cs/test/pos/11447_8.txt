Demon Night (1988) was another in a long line of "teen" horror movies that were released on video and paid. during that movie mecca make the 1980s. But unlike most of the bullshit that was around, it was a decent watch. A group of bored teenagers opt for a Halloween night party with a couple of bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotyped teenagers are invited to a party. But the average teen bash turns into a night of horror when he tries to survive the Halloween night when the undead Hull House people decide that the party will break up. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A nice horror movie that's best seen in an unrated version. If you look at the R-Rated cut, you will miss all the effects of spraying and nudity. Stay tuned for a fun epilogue! Gory's film, followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Only for horror movies! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
