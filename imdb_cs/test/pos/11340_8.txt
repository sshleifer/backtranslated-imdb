I didn't know the weather for a long time, which I like this movie or not. This is surprising, because I usually know, but because the film went nowhere, I was a little confused. Two people moved to a little communal environment. Finding their husbands constantly working or away on a business trip, their attention, from total loneliness, goes to itself. After a platonic love affair, the male executive Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is wounded, although their love affair has not been physically filled. Chiu leaves the country just to come back a few years later when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> The film is correct for the cynical part. By never actively or actually touching a part of love, but only approaching it, the film admits that there are more than many others in this place. I think it is also true that nothing good could come if they continued the matter. At least it's the feeling I get. If we were to believe it, when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, not a means to anything other than alpha and omega, the end itself," then this film lacks unfortunately Or, if you have a tendency towards absolutely incomplete minimalism, it strikes it right on the mark.What movies in history have reached, addressed, or maintained this phrase, if only for a moment? Harry met Sally, effectively proposing this romantic perfection, and getting into it all, it is interesting that when Harry met Sally, it is done during wooing, rather than at reaching it. Nicholas Spark's Recent Movie Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other movie; we believe that once love is reached, it flies from the radar only when it exists in perfection in it what other dimension, or, truer perhaps, becomes a latent means for other ends? In the mood for love, there is an honest film with beautiful and generous cinematography, worthy of all the best that Almodovar offers, but at the end of all it can say, "life is Sometimes they like it. "Now in no way does it mean that it can be said, especially if it was said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last law when Kar Wai Wong tries to round the film by associating it with the wider historical theme for the second time, which plays in the background of the relationship that has just taken place This is a valuable effort and variation of the musical theme that takes place throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the relatively alternative accusation of the topic plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on a holistically inclined audience, so the viewer can divide the difference, the error in each movie, the director should know where he is going and how to get there, but in all honesty it is just one bad line. there is one remarkable imperfection that would spoil the perfect barrel of honey. But effort is definitely worth it; The theme of expanding and rounding the film and raising it beyond the micro-sense of the pair, but without any real foretaste is a major mistake. In a word, and unfortunately it is too late. I think it is also an overwhelming challenge for a non-Asian viewer who is not sufficiently familiar with China's history to fully appreciate this vast move.
