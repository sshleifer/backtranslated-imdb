OK, so I'm not usually the one who runs out and rents foreign movies ... especially the dark dark comedy. I think, on the one hand, I can count the number of movies that I considered really happy from start to finish. This movie will be added to the shortlist. Even the dark Hollywood comedies sometimes turn me off because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this had my eyes that rose with tears. My hips hurt. I didn't laugh long. This movie was recommended by my mother, and I don't think I would dream of watching him if she didn't have to hurry. Feel free to read during your movie - you'll miss a fun movie.
