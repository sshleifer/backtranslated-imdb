This is the top car flick (His Artwork / YER Artwork!) All the classic cars no plastic fantastic, I watched over and over I wore two video tapes, and will wear much more. Many other young and old car lovers will love this movie and watch it more than 1 time! so you can hire it or buy it (just see it) I wish they were doing more (auto) movies like this V8 performance that didn't bite small snipers !!!! <br /> <br /> (351 right?) (motor magic) (car heap) <br /> <br /> (you need to learn to feel power)
