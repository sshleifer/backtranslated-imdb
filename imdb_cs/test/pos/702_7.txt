Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaws, but now Scott's sheriff and young Ford are still busy. He hired him to pull out the bank job, but he was late to get to the city and those who hired him got someone else. This leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a movie that is not even 90 minutes long. Randy and Glenn have girls here. Claire Trevor plays his usual good gallery with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan, who falls on Ford for a long time without realizing who he is or why he came to town, where Scott is the sheriff. It's a B western, but unusual for time and has been devoted to a full technical adjustment for Columbia Pictures. Desperadoes labeled Glenn Ford's first film in technology, a process reserved for some of the more expensive movies from larger studios. Harry Cohn was definitely not for him. And certainly not during wartime. The plot gets a bit convoluted, as both Ford and Scott are subjected to a friendship test versus expediency / duty. The plot also includes some highly hypocritical skunks in Randy, who are true outlaws in terms of film. Four executives are doing a great job and the best side performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's cute explosive lunkhead sidekick. The climax includes a herd of cattle and a shootout in the city salon and is one of the best ever made in Western film. Fans of four leading and western audiences will enjoy this movie.
