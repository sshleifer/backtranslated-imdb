A strange but beautifully original film. Really scary, scary and ridiculous in the same measures. The red brick high-rise setting is the perfect backdrop for scary events. The idea of ​​a secret closed room in such a location is good enough, but when a leading naive couple begins to clean up the old bed they find in this room, the scene is meant for some classic chills. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey really gets to chew on some scenery after being undervalued in other Full Moon movies. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is much bigger in Hollywood - his gradual eyes during bed making are really fun. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and is a truly exceptional Full Moon / Darkwave release. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
