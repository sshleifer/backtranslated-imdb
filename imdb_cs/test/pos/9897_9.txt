I was also lucky to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falke at the Phoenix Film Festival. It is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience fascinated in Applebaum's life situation. More than funny, every character in the family contributes an invaluable comic relief that not only stimulates laughter, but also inspires several joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a ninety-year-old "young" father of three who, together with adult children, bring what might be one of the most important times of his life. The two-day journey that the Applebaum family takes despite the beautiful New York backdrop (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves viewers who want more but nourishes their own sense of family. "Checking Out" needs to see a movie, not only for everyone who appreciates families but also everyone who doesn't have it !!! I would like to thank the director for giving this GIFT to his audience.
