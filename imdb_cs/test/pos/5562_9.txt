Just borrowing a series of DVDs of a series from my rather obsessive brother, I expected to get through the first few episodes and give it back. I just found myself screaming on the screen to finish the first season on the cliff - just a week later and watching the whole season. Where I found the time for it I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. She does not take too seriously, has nice characters that behave well, and special effects (ignoring the strange puppet puppets here and there) are so "strange" that she will give her this polished feel. At first I didn't realize that it was mostly shot here, and it seemed to be strange to hear so many Aussie accents at the Sci-Fi show - it was the most fun for the main character (John) to land back in Sydney amid the first season. <br /> <br /> I believe the greatest strength of this show is the vision that the filmmakers apparently had. They gradually introduced new aspects to the characters that explain earlier acts, and continue to laugh at John's conversations with slang in a fun and non-violent way. In addition, when I watched the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I see that there is little conspiracy - so we managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest is just as good. Farscape is not like any other Sci-Fi that I have enjoyed in the past. I heard the fourth season is not as good as the first three, and now I'm quite upset that they canceled it before 5 o'clock. I hope to revive this show - with the same actors in the movie or other series. It would be a shame to leave as many lines of unfinished conspiracy as I imagine having a show that had so many thoughts that it would be without remedy, let me steal. I have to go now ... heading back to my brother's place to climb the second season. <br /> <br /> V.
