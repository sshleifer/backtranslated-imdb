What some Hollywood movies try and practically never succeed in, creating some metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), this beautiful film perfectly manages (somewhat resembles the beautiful movie La Double Vie de Veronique by the same director). and with the same beautiful actress). It is a REAL film that changes the way life looks a bit - a smart and beautiful story, masterfully driven, outstanding main actors, master cinematography. I have seen the 3rd or 4th time movie and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you were to be dissatisfied with the end of "White" - "Red" gives a happy ending to the whole trilogy.
