Both Disney and Bill Paxton have done a great job of portraying a story that is actually based. You don't have to like golf to appreciate the story of man's struggle to overcome chances. It could be based on any sport or any other situation that involves competition, even if it just happened with Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would like to see a little deeper into each of the main characters, especially. Mr. Ouimet. Mr Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, a turn of the century America, where "class lines" are well defined and woe to anyone who tries to stand up to his "class" position. I did some historical research and my biggest question was really answered, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are slightly different than those shown in the movie, I came up with a sense of content. I enjoyed this film, I believe you too.
