People who compare this movie with big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or The Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this film has landed. Although missing in the big special effects department and there are no hundreds of bonuses, there is still a masterful combination of two old folk tales. Talent acting, though not-list, is still great, and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more honest than in the larger movie with the A-list cast. My favorite favorite of this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, extremely assisted by a huge wardrobe and makeup. She injected humanity and the feeling of pathos into the fallen season, which was destroyed by the devil's evil magic. Fonda aside from acting was not what we expected from Hollywood, which I think is a good thing because Hollywood Hollywood ideas about how to train your acting talents to show roles and become obsolete and dependent on CGI and other special effects Make us from actors who use the same tricks on us. Instead, it shows new thoughts on the actual acting of actors about how they can find new variations on old topics of love and danger.
