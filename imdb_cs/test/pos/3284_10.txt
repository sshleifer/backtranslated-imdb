Firstly, ignore the commentary on how South Park should entertain Republicans. Everyone is doing it, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media do? And what Republicans do is more serious and less fun than Al Gore and its global warming hysteria. But besides, this episode is just fun. The depiction of Al Gore must be one of the best policy politics I've ever seen, was original and was based on people's views on man. I don't want to give up, but I had to roll on the floor. There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments. <br /> <br /> I would say everything is one of the best episodes ever had, and I would recommend it to everyone.
