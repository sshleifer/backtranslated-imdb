Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are excellent as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during World War I. The dialogue is very entertaining and Jimmy Durante is cheerful as the ship's cook "Ptomaine". Walter Huston's character is inspiring as a submarine captain, a stellar officer and gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this film was the level of technology depicted on battle scenes. I was surprised how similar technology of the First World War was related to technology that occurred 25 years later in World War II. The basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times and far from conservatism that I thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. All in all, I felt that the cast, characters, action scenes, and view of history displayed in this movie were first-rate.
