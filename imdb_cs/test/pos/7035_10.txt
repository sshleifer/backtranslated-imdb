This timeless summer love story is classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie I could watch every few weeks and still love. There's something timeless about this movie. I loved other "blockbusters" like Pretty Woman and when Harry Sally met. I think it's there, but there's something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. Characters, chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the film's direction, INCREDIBLE dance, warm summer atmosphere, all about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like it was before or since. I don't think there is one particular element that would love this movie, but many things, many of which are mentioned by a number of reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, poor, summer mood, realistic characters, a relative honest message associated with incredible music and dance, and one of the best cinema dance sequences he has ever given us. This film is always on TV and I will continue to watch it for as long as it shows. However, I will mention that I am not interested in seeing the "Havana Nights", this should remain alone.
