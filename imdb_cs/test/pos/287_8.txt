Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as something more than a playful and undeniably erotic swing to be is simply not playing with a full deck. It is clear from the title that this low-budget horror comedy is not meant to be taken seriously ... it's like a tongue-in-cheek like a French kiss of a nymphomaniac, as well as a title. Female cast members are great and fun to watch. Check it out, Rolfe Kanefsky is a clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this is fun all the time with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, but instead seeks all possible ways to create risqu√© gags and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, a femme fatale brunette who portrays the sexy, murderous side of Jacqueline, is a real knockout. Watch and Enjoy!
