I saw a film in Izmir as the final film of Izmir. I didn't know anything about it, but now I'm glad I didn't refuse to see Ding-a-ling-less! It's one of the most entertaining movies I've ever watched and believe me I've seen millions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Smart script and dialogues ... Smart details ... What else can I say? India's masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor ... You can't stop by wonder what's capable now. Ding-a-ling was less shot dead five years ago and I'm sure director Onur Tukel is now more mature. I have heard that his next function will be political satire and I really can't wait to see that even among his previous works, such as "The House of Pancakes" ...
