I came across this film by accident. How else could I find out? It didn't bother the studios at all, nor did I hear it from my normally involved friend. After this year's throwing of my money for so many bad movies, I wish I could see it in theaters as opposed to DVDs. Mike Judge is the master of camouflage of deliciously intelligent humor in a low eyebrow package. Just watch the "King of the Hill" for a while ... it is a seemingly mysterious humor, but at the same time it is a very gentle cry on the weeds and at the same time very sympathetic. I read this movie's slogan and ordered it from the internet right away. I really don't understand where these negative reviews came from, except perhaps Carl's Jr. This film is not only cheerful but also balanced. Moments of Levity are scattered between cheerful gags of sight and strike in our present superstar / corporate culture. Sure, there is some fart humor, but it's just there to laugh ridiculously. The assumption is only semi-credible, but since what was important? I don't see people who would despise Futurama because the assumption is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you don't laugh, then something is wrong with you. Maybe your dad works for Gatorade or something, and the movie was really offended. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the other one.
