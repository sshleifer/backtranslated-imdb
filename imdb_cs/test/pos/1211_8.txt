The world was simple in the 1980s. Hulk Hogan would marry Roddy Piper or Bobby Heenan's friends or Ted DiBiase and win victoriously more than not. Sometimes he manages to win allies like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about Hull Hogan and Bobby Heenan, and so it should be. But this night, which was to change, the new champion, the man who thought WWE would be their man for the 1990s, was crowned. It didn't work out. However, WWE was right about one thing: the Hulkamania was completed and a new order had to be created. This historic Wrestlemania, the first to be held outside of America, kicked off with Rick Martel, who defeated Koko B Ware. Koko was never very lucky in Wrestlemania and was shot down in short order here. Another colossal fusion of Andr√© Giant and Haku placed their teams' teams titles against Demolition Ax and Smash and lost. New Champion Champion Champions crowned. Another match saw the earthquake beat Hercules. Hercules was another colleague who wasn't very lucky in Wrestlemania. Good luck to Brutus Beefcake when Mr. Perfect's unbeaten streak ended. Well, I think somebody had to quit. Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown battled against double counting in a slow but fun match, another Hart Foundation beat Nikolay Volkov and Boris Zhukov at age 19. seconds. Unfortunately unfortunately no match. The barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short match. American Dream Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then beat Macho King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a messy mixed tag. This was the only female match really happening in WWE at this time of the time. Next was a fun match as both Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated the Orient Express in a quick meeting. There were a lot of good teams of brands at the moment. Jim Duggan then defeated Dina Bravo in nothing else. Another Ted DiBiase gave his most valuable asset, the Million Dollar Championship on the line against Jake Roberts. Roberts was scattered by Virgil and allowed to allow Ted to retain his title in a fun match and one of the longer matches on the show. Next up The Twin Towers collide as Bossman defeats Ake in short, followed by Rick Rude, who wins a short match with Jimmy Snake. Finally, we got to the main event with Hulk Hogan, who puts WWE on the front page of Interkontinent Master The Ultimate Warrior. This is a fun match that the Warrior won after Hogan missed his leg. The crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great show. And so the torch went through, but could the Ultimate Warrior be the champion who hoped WWE would be?
