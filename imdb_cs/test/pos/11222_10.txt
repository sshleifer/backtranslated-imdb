I recently attended Sundance, as I have often done in recent years, and was treated for little pleasure in strange little indies, an abundance of dark comedies, and now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Poland 'Northfork' and I remembered why I fell in love with movies in the first place. 'Northfork' stretches across the screen with a visionary bold and harkens back to the key early work of Terence Malick and the existential landscape of Antonioni. It's impossible to explain the film easily, which is one of many of its strengths. Suffice it to say it's a fairy tale of adults with many carefully layered levels of meaning. Again, she awakened my imagination and cast an impressive shadow on all the other movies I saw this year. It is a work of careful craftsmanship and sophistication of writing that is not seen in most American movies. I plan to visit this movie again several times when it comes to my theater. It is a charming piece of magic and mystery, a scary work where one can roam the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast performs this luminous piece with a striking conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of nerves and courageous speeches throughout their careers. Maybe 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American film where excellence in craft and writing becomes the norm rather than the exception. You see it when your journey comes and you take your friends to questions, there will be many, and the thoughts and feelings prompted by seeing that 'Northfork' will awaken memories of the great movie you once saw in your past and hopefully maybe returns with the arrival of the Polish brothers.
