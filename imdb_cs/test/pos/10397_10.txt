I first saw the film a few years ago and was totally and utterly amazed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, though it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too beautiful if you want. Anyway, one thing is for sure - the man with the camera did a great job - every picture deserves to be cut off and portrayed as a separate peace of art, comparable to that of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. Music is the perfect background for the story, especially U2, which played between the first and second novel on the beach. As for the casting - I can't be objective because I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue and I can't add more to the praising remarks of others. However, the fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated at the cinema) criticized the film followed me with a more critical eye a second time. There is no doubt that the setting is beautiful and the cast is wonderful. But that's not enough to create a coherent and coherent film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovice is somehow superficial and doesn't say much about the motivations of the people involved - it was just about filming a beautiful and sensual love scene with naked Marceau or what?). It does not seem to add anything to the film's idea, and even the raspy voice of Malcovic is unable to link him to the main plot. The other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which is governed by many logical errors. The scene where Jean Reneau overlooks the city across the huge window of her apartment on top of a tall building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of humid air and the delicate haze that spreads through the first scene of "Ferrera" can be literally perceived through the screen. Undoubtedly, Antonioni is a great master of shades and halftones. My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deepest and meaningful - I think it's the most Antonioni like in the whole movie - almost parable. Probably the overall positive impression of the film is mainly due to the latest movie. one shot somewhere in the small Italian town of Ghotic, with winding narrow streets and winding sidewalks, fountains with l'eau drinking water and monumental cathedrals ... It was laconic but really touching. I hope that my impressions and comments on the movie, be it chaotic, would motivate someone to spend the night watching (it works better with a home theater, someone who cares for yours) than in the cinema). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Please for mercy for imperfect English and possible typos
