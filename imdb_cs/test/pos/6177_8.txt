I am Czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who escaped Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are real heroes and bravest men in our history. This film by the Academy Award winner "Kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first big film about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers from "Heavenly Riders" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good playing, good special effects, nice music, etc. The movie is half in English and some actors are British. But the biggest thing about this film is pure existence. It is a great chance to show people around the world (and many people in the Czech Republic ...) that the Czechoslovak role in World War II was not just an occupied country, but an active member of the Allied campaign. Leading characters are older and wiser Francis and young Charles. Together they escaped from Czechoslovakia, flew in the same squadron and fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a clich√©, but fortunately this story isn't so aggressive and is in balance with other scenes (including great fights). I don't want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone likes PH and someone likes DBW. But if you like happy endings, DBW is not for you. I think it is a very good movie for anyone who likes this type of story and a very good film that wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history. BTW, the main theme of "Dark Blue World" is from the 1930s and 1940s of the composer Jaroslav Jezek. "He wrote this topic when he lost his eyes ...
