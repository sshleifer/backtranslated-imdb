I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater, I wasn't in the mood at the time. It's like an olive garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right spirit to enjoy it. I'm not quite sure what dampened my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme gave me bad memories of Kevin Costner's latest movie, Waterworld. And despite the promise Ashton Kutcher made at The Butterfly Effect, I still haven't sold it completely. Something about the guy I'm sorry about. It's probably related to his monkey features. It took about two minutes for my fears to retreat and my hesitation disappeared. The film immediately throws us into a tense rescue mission and was tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My fears briefly took on Kutcher's initial appearance, given that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cold and rebellious. Sunglasses, tough guy toothpick in mouth and sportin 'with a grin that would make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we'll get it. I was absolutely ready to hate him. But then he had to go and bring enough power and force me to soften the wounds. <br /> <br /> Dear Apes! Effectively blending time, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid gameplay, The Guardian is an easy movie to say that most viewers will enjoy. You can argue about its clich√©, predictability, and the rare moments of overcrowded happiness, but none of this takes the value of fun. I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much if Costner started training young guys, but on the contrary, training could be the most interesting aspect of the movie. Coast Guard Rescuers Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never been shown on the big screen, so I feel the inner look at what they go through and how difficult it is to be very informative and a great way to familiarize viewers with this under-signed group. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Think about it - you get on a dangerous mission in cold, dark, rough water and then you have to fight with disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while trying to help people who are in panic who are dependent on you. for their survival. And if everything that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everyone, so you have to make a hard decision about who lives and who dies. A person who wants all those responsibilities? I do not! I had no idea what it was like for these guys, and who would have thought I would have the film Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner for my education? Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this precious breed of hero, but it also has a good job for us to entertain its paying customers. GIST <br /> <br /> Spectators wanting to look inside for a brave rescue mission in the ocean would like to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but I paid if I felt I had money.
