Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard this double dvd came out, I was obviously excited. I just looked at the chase and said if you're a Zeppelin fan, you gotta run now and buy it now! It's absolutely spectacular! It blows 'Songs The Same' completely out of the water. Why this material has never been released before I am. The shots presented here really show Zep on top of their game, which I never felt like 'Song' quite. Jimmy Page is the best, no doubt, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix a chump! Beware of the lively jam "White Summer" ... grow up! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 of 10
