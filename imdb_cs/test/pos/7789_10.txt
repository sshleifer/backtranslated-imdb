I love this movie. Illustration of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla a.k.a. "Shut up, Robert!" he was so cheerful. Whenever he got into a battle scene, you heard him scream. Viju Khote is stunned by Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love that Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". Paresh Rawala's double role is so amazingly cheerful for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are from this world. My brother has really good Bhalla mimics. "Relax. PLEASE." I love the scene in which Aamir Khan presents a laxative in Salman's "Muscles" Khan's meal, which caused irregular bowel movements that forced him to use the toilet many times.
