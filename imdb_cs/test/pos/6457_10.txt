For the first time I saw this film on the cable in the 80s and it shook me to the core. Again it appeared on television about six months ago. Black and white cinematography, filmed on-site, graphically depicts New York in 1950 as a bold "urban jungle" at a time when there was much more industry and industry. port activity in the city, especially in Manhattan. John Cassavetes has always brought a special intensity to his acting and is magnificent in the role of an army killer. His 1959 short "Johnny Staccato" television series is also a pleasure to watch. Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring their roles fresh and vibrant. But it's a great play by Jack Warden as a crazy, brutal boss who has caught my attention. To get an idea of ​​Warden's versatility, watch this movie, then check out the 1962 episode of the TV series "Naked City" entitled "Specter of Rose Street Gang (Available on Video)." If you're a fan of the noir movie, you need to see it. Enjoy!
