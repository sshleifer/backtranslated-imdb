Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide", now I catch up with director directorial debut Hur Jin-ho "Christmas in August". The diversity of themes and the level of success speaks highly of a national cinema mature for discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) manages his impending death and sublimation of his desires towards Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) from true love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting her. The success of this type of film is based on the skills of the actors. Han and Shim excel, both very expressive, but natural. A number of secondary characters, relatives of Jung Won, friends, and clients, are quickly demarcated to enrich the story without harming its main focus. To live them love, but all things have to go through. Pain recedes. Life goes on.
