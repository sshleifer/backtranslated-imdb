This is from much of the same creative team behind "Better Off Dead", but it's not as good as that amazing teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but it's everywhere and just not so funny. Curtis Armstrong is used to less effect (he was incredibly humorous in "Better Off Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is Jolly, Cusack's Good, Demi Moore's Demi Moore (Just With Better Hair Here.) Overall his fun, and as a person from t Cape Cod, very effectively captures the feeling of the '80s Cape Cod, who for some reason feels more "mainstream" than "Better off Dead." If you're a fan of John Cusack and Savage Steve Holland his definitely recommended.
