This is a great Valentine's Day gift. Gorgeous guy and pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat competition in baking competition. Very romantic. I am a true fan of Costas Mandylor since his days at Picket Fences and has not lost his attraction. Lauren Holly is still beautiful and delightful and both still have great chemistry. The support cast was also good. Seeing all the wonderful desserts that were made, it was in itself an excellent sight. I loved Costas and Lauren teaming up to win the baking and love contest. This is the type of film that will satisfy all the palatas, romantic and other. Hallmark always shows perfection in its programs and is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. It also shows that sometimes they love victory over any kind of adversity. I found myself sighing and wishing more for this film and also the desire for those wonderful desserts. I recommend this movie to all ages. A great treat for everyone.
