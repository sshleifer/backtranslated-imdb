If you like the tension this movie has. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays mute increases her misfortune and increases tension. The look of Alec Guinness was nice, but it didn't really add to the film. I'm not sure if the part of Evan Richard as Andy Clarke is trying to add some humor, or if he was just a fool. I thought cinema was excellent. This contributed not only to the quality of production but also to the tension. The bath observed with the droplets of water in slow motion was amazing. Also, the scene where the knife goes down and then switches to Andy Clarke's cutting was a very good piece of meat. I would call it good fun overall
