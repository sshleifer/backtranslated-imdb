I liked this movie, the second feature film Naruto. I liked it in the snow a little better when I found the story a bit disjointed because I wasn't sure where some things would happen or when. Just like the first movie, this one also has a nice run for an hour and a half, a lot of time for a nice and well-developed movie with really great fighting. The story begins with a ninja from a village hidden in the sand in battle with unknown invaders. Then it comes across Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru, who are hunting ferrets for what they think will be easy. They soon discover otherwise how they are also attacked, and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young fighter dressed in armor. They are both injured and accepted by the caravan and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization wishing to create a utopia. Of course, everything isn't as it seems, and there's a lot of fighting that needs to be done. My favorite was the one that included Garau battling this strange woman who takes it very easily, which is a very big mistake. The final fight is also very good and includes Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of the previous movies.
