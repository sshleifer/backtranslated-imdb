Hi; Belmondo! See that Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent want to call it), not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not flawless, but hey such realism, style, warmth and humor. I like the NY accent; "you know nothing!"; "forget it". Like the French New Wave, it's about young people; partying, in love or just around you. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; is delightful; Great. Ben Carruthers is also good, he reminds me of Belmond. A movie you won't forget. <br /> <br /> Stable 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
