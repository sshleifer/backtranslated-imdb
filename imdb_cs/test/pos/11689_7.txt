Wow. At first I thought who wrote these things! How difficult this choice is between a man who offers you, your children wealth, decency and security unlike a husband who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. However, our decisions are not always as clear as one would think. The rich gentleman was actually a woman she could aspire to, and yet ... her husband's move, her sexual desire was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do? As a spectator, you become so confused and misguided as she is. In this place, I actually came to say this, was my admiration for Engish's voice, I thought, though it is actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie. Looking at him, I find out that he is Glen Hansard, whom I have never heard of before. What a finding. I'm so grateful. Wow, what voice! It's a day! Thank you BIFF!
