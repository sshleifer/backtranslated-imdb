It's great for children's film. As an adult and mother, I enjoyed watching a movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this movie. The following * could be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns the courage and learns that in this movie will not judge others so quickly. He also learns that he does not give up hope and manages his anger. I loved the sense of teamwork you got from watching Barbie and her sister and friends solve the puzzle. I didn't find anything offensive or inappropriate for the young audience. In fact, I felt that the film's moral message was excellent and well done. The animation was pretty good. I really enjoy the skating scene and I think they were very well done. There's a lot of action in this movie, so I think most kids would enjoy it ... not just those who are really into Barbie. My daughter actually chose it because of Pegasus. She loves horses. But she liked the film very much. My daughter is autistic and has been able to sit and enjoy the whole movie. She really liked the action scenes and any part of the horse. One thing I was thinking about was the fact that many people object to Barbie (and Ken) because they're so beautiful. Still, I think children, like adults, look at beautiful people and things. It's natural. We are also looking forward to seeing beautiful movie stars as adults. It's amazing that the figure of Barbie and her "friend" have plenty of personality. While it's fun to watch nice people, it's old if there's no fabric behind a pretty face. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it. :)
