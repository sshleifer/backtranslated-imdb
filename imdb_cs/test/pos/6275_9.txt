Miles O'Keeffe once again takes on the role of a powerful Ator in this first sequel to the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana! The storyline is ridiculous, the screenplay is terrible, acting is horrible throughout the text, special effectsâ€¦ well, don't even go there! - all this is a real pleasure! The main elements of the movie include Ator and Thong (his muted companion, not his underwear), who are invaded by invisible cave cads (sure saved on fx budget!), Ator fights what he must to be the most unconvincing giant of the snake ever devoted to celluloid, and of course the infamous hangliding scene! There's one question I have, though ... ... at the end of the movie, we see a huge atomic explosion when Ator allegedly destroys the Geometric Core (as the narrator tells us). ... in hell Ator destroyed it and managed to get out alive?! Did he have some form of primitive timer / detonator or something? Well, such an illogical ending really only contributes to the whole charm of the films - they don't do that anymore!
