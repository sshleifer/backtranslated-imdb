It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great. It had drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard to laugh when Gus talks. I wish Gus hit Clara as if Inez did it. Clara just leads Gus for all these years without intending to marry him. She just played with him. It was sad that he had spent his life pining for her. It would be nice if Woodrow married Maggie, but she would still die for him. Woodrow was a man who couldn't express his feelings and keep them in bottles. It was obvious that Maggie loved the raid on Austin when the guards returned and ran to keep her. Val Kilmer is excellent when playing odd characters. I loved his portrayal of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole Lonesome Dove saga. Comanche Moon is the best of the game.
