The last installment sees Sho Aikawu and Riki Takeuchi (looking cooler than ever in his reversible coat!), Who opposed each other for one last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes much to Blade Runner, but done in Takashi Miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. I felt it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the end was still outrageous, it lacked the value of the shock of the previous two. Compared to times like Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is nowhere so extreme, but it is true to the other two trilogy movies. This means that the fans of the first two (and fans of Miike) will get a lot of it because it brings together all three films and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists.
