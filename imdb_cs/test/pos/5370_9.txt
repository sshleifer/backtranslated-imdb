One of the best less known occult-oriented horror movies of the 1970s. It is bold, exciting, frightening, surreal here and there, and very clever at times, which cannot be said of many films of this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphorical points in the seventies of society and the generation of things that made this movie. The screenwriter probably cooks and also supplies some old scenes from the crypt. The result of the work is a well done work of a creative director and it is fun and provocative thinking. A simple but effective ending specifically shows how those who can handle these things properly. The excellent cast was mostly unknown to me, with the exception of LQ Jones as a whimsical but funny Sheriff and Strother Martin. city ​​doctor. Martin, surprisingly, always steals the film. With this voice and skill it is one of the biggest loons in movies for me. What is an actor! So it is a little mystery to me why this film has not received much greater recognition. I think it deserves almost the same place in the occult horror canon next to Rosemary's child and Exorcist. One great movie!
