* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the movie fun. It was weird and I enjoy it, I laughed a lot, so the bottom line is that I recommend the movie. However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. The plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a hard life wife wife watch her husband is murdered while having forgotten everything she saw, she followed her "true love" for soap series character, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple, but not enough to hold a 95 minute film. And here comes the big question. The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. The Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, while Dorothy comes to the conclusion that "not a place at home", Betty does not come to a conclusion and we wondered what to do by the end of the film She learned from her experience and the answer is nothing. It does not seem to affect her at all. Then is the film about the difference between reality and fantasy? It could be, but the scenes that deal with this subject are short and do not serve more than just a joke and not as a serious conspiracy that the film can make in other places. subject in a much better way). The film might be about obsession. \ tBetty is obsessed with soapy series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty. \ tLaBute shows two sides of obsession and seems to forget that obsession, in whatever form, is dangerous, and he should be condemned.It seems to be sympathetic to Betty's obsession with obsession because he sees it as a harmless one. Throughout the film we have scenes that could have been the subject of the film itself, but we have thought about it without affecting the characters. The End is Just Makeup That Has Nothing in Common It's a shame because the movie could be sharper if it focused on one or two objects. a lot, but he doesn't say anything. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the feeling that we saw a small movie, funny and weird, which could have been much more.
