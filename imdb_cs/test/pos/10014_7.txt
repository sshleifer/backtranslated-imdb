"Night of the Hunted" stars French porn stars Brigitte Lahaie. In fact, many cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of his frantic shooting. This movie is definitely different than Rollin's usual lesbian vampire whip but it's not so memorable such as "blood lips" or "fascination" .Lahaie plays amnesiac hitchhiker who doesn't remember who she is or where she came from. Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex, where Lahaie is held by some medical group that treats a number of people with a similar condition. Incidentally, he escapes from a monolithic office tower where the disabled are held. On the highway outside the city meets a young man, "Night Hunted" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately the pace is extremely slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad, and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum inmate Dominique Journet is well developed. The e Hunted "is too boring to be absolutely fun. Look only when you're a fan of Jean Rollin's 7 out of 10 and that's kind."
