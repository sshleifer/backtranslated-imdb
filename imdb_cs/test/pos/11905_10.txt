I love this movie and recommend it to anyone.Damian Chap and Jennifer Tilly played their roles perfectly. Only the characters pull you into the movie. The director was also magnificent. Stuck on the screen throughout the movie, not one scene was slow.The movie also has a lot of action packed scenes, cars blow up, etc. The film is just all around the masterpiece. If you like real fun movies then watch it because you will be on the edge of your seat all the time. I'll put this movie on my top ten all time sheets because there is never a boring moment in the movie and this is my type of movie. 2 inches up all the way up !!!!!!!!!
