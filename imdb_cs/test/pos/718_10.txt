Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Children's Teachers" is a stunning, distracting work. Montgomery's courageous cinematographer and cinematography, coupled with brilliantly unemployed performances that evoke her cast, increase the sense of shocking, brutal realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old seduction Jennifer with a marriage counselor. The scenes between incredibly uninteresting actress Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most exciting and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson learned in the end? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." I highly recommend this remarkable piece of "Art" for all those interested in an independent cinema.
