I'm going to the movies to be fun. The first movie in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had a lot of twists and turns to make me very interested. Angels and demons are no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, then you will surely enjoy this movie. Angels and demons get the same style as the previous movie, but faster, which I liked. Ron Howard put me in place for two hours without being bored. What I really liked about this movie was that although it is obviously fictional, they leave enough real history, it seems very believable. If there is one thing I don't like about this movie, it's that the story is very unbelievable (you don't want to give it spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained the whole thing and I was very pleased with what I saw.
