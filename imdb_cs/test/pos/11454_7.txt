The 1980s are largely regarded as a decade in which horror has been decided to entertain. Sometimes there were some brains behind him (such as "Evil Dead II", "Night of the Creeps" and "Return of Living Dead"), and then there were films that were thoughtless but had some low rent charm. and were perfect for the night with beer and friends. Films such as "Bits" and "Blood Diner" stacked in the midday and nineties make rental shelves that offer little intelligence or craftsmanship, but plenty of silly entertainment. Kevin Tenney's 1988 film "Night of Demons" is part of this tradition - stupid, poorly bred and not original bones in the body, but damn if you don't have a good time. The story is so simplistic that it must have come from the 1980s: a group of stupid teens, played by actor partners in the mid-20th century, decide to go to a party at the Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Queen Linnea Quigley's Shout Legend.) Well, Angela et al. decide to throw a session. It turned out to be the way it would have been Arobt's "Arrested Development" by Gobo, who would call it "a huge mistake" because demonic power soon owns Angela and begins to get into others. Take "The Evil Dead", "Nightmare on Elm Street" and your average silly dead teen movie, throw them into a blender, and "Night of Demons" is what you get. The film is something other than original and it is not really a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derived, acting is terrible, jokes often fall flat, characters are uncomfortable (especially Stooge's character) and plot holes are numerous. It's out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. So why? Well for one thing, makeup and gore effects are top notch, with some really unforgettable moments (especially ugly and just an odd plane with a lipstick tube) that really stand out. Also rarely, if it is sometimes taken too seriously but with the exception of some terrible puns, it plays straight and never loses the time of viewers with a blink of self-awareness. In addition, there is some energy and enthusiasm for the entire business, which is almost impossible to resist. Yeah, it's nothing special, but she knows, and she couldn't be more proud of it. It's a goofy party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything more. It may not be a classic, but "Demon Night" is a good example of what horror junk food is doing. Maybe it's not too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want to have a luxury beer. Sometimes you want Budweiser.
