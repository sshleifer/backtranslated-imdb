What gas from the movie! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this is out of the rest. Only the classic "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can approach this classic. I know these four American films I have mentioned are not films in themselves, but rather detective stories with complicated storylines that still emit noirean, courageous quality about them, much like "Rififi". Otherwise, there is a way in which Jules Dassin sets the film's overall atmosphere, not only in the bold realism of principals, but also in using the streets of Paris as a subliminal figure and co-creator. ! The film focuses on "le Stephanois", a dark, moody, and complicated ex-con that has been shot in a huge reward shot. Though he is a staunch and stubborn man, he still feels a desire for some redemption by breaking out of the demons of his past (hey, he saved little Toni!). Dassin chose the right guy (Jean Servais) for this role. The fact that the rest of the story unfolding falls into place when we go through the famous "silent" caper scene to eventually disappear the main "perps". Only their women survive, except for Ida, Mary's honey. They seemed to best understand the basic vanity of it all!
