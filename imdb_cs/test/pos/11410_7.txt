Simon Wests pg-13 thriller about a babysitter who gets distracting prank calls while sitting at a mansion is neither original nor exciting to be called a good movie. While there are some elements of tension, good eye candy and decent characters, the movie is just another I know what you did last summer, as it is a lack to take seriously. The show was fine, but nothing special with this movie, I say skip if you're looking for an average movie, you can find better movies than this for a lifetime ever, fine maybe not a lifetime, but at least the US or something, haha. ... <br /> 7/10
