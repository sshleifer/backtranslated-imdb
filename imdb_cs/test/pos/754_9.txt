If someone puts a compendium on modern American horror that is really worth it it's salt, it will have * be a record for SF Brownrigg's ubiquitous exercize in asylum horror. Every time I watch this film, I am impressed by the complete economy of the film, from a compact, totally separate plot to a mysterious beginning and an overly horrible end, an engaging performance that was essentially a non-professional group. actors, and the prevailing sense of horror and claustrophobia that effectively consumes narrarus with a certain inevitability that is all the more terrifying that viewers know what's going on long before the hero, the only question being when they go. to Wake Up and Feel Coffee? He shot at the dental dental budget in his native Texas Brownrigg on the old palace estate, which serves nicely as an environment for a private sanatorium. another interesting twist on good old Edgar Allan Poe tome about prisoners who take asylum just before the otherwise "normal" outsider, unknowingly joins the ranks without realizing until it's too late that not everything is what it seems they are totally cut off and out of any help from the outside, and inevitably find their own common sense, which is questioned when the madness gets out of control - the original STAR STAR TREK series came to it with its 1968 WHOM GODS DESTROY episode, Juan Moctezuma put the peyote driving Mexican psychedelic trip in DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972, and tangentially related, is Fernando Di Leo's ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER HOTEL, which injects elements of an unknown killer and an end that can only be defined as "Splatter Cinema" - Brownrigg may not have seen or thought SLAUGHTER HOTEL but he certainly came up with similar ideas. Legaliciuos Former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik Plays Charlotte Beale, RN in Clinical Psychology who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel out to the center of some god left the trash directly from Peckinpah to work with Dr. Stevens in his private sanitorium. Dr. Stevens pioneered a new form of therapy based on the vital encouragement of emotionally and psychologically scarred in the face of their inner obsessions, bringing them to the surface, and hopefully relieving patients of everything that erases their mind. A nice idea, but to equip a 6-foot 250 pound totally crazy man with an ax and tell him to pound his aggression AND HOW TO TURN ON BACK TO HIM is probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is sent out before Mrs. Holotik even appears on the screen with a good blow to the bottom of the skull. This event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one of Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick, who also served as a script supervisor and production manager], a woman of surprisingly professional performance that quickly destroys the situation with Sam, a wonderfully unlikely hero. a film, a lobotomized African-American bohemian who played an actor named Bill McGhee, who was unfortunately robbed of his support for an Oscar nomination for his muscle mass move with the brain of an 8-year-old boy. Sam's only wish is to help him give his valuable toy boat "in the water" and his constant demand of various female cast members to do [and his nonstop consumption of chocolate ice creams] as * SOM * kind of basic subject, though this will be avoided because the children will still be awake. There is also quick help for an employee who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients, but I will leave the details to my discovery. Mrs. Holotik Comes Just As Dr. Stevens was effectively laid to rest, and quickly won over the fact that Mrs. Masters, who reluctantly allowed the young nurses to stay overwhelmingly despite the tragedy that had just happened. MINUTES AGO, which you have to admit is rather sporting. Sister Beale, a holotist, begins to demonstrate that this is not the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer, but when she learned that she shared the living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and that there were no locks on the door and escape to the nearest ace. A hardware store pick up a hasp and padlock to ensure, and we are treated to a couple of truly scary scenes where some of the prisoners sneak into her room & do things like smell her hair, trying to kill her butcher knives and caress her neck with ax heads. But that's just part of the work in such a radical environment of psychiatric health, the magistrate informs her, and her oddly defined "bikes" that consist of wearing a nurse's leg as you can find on 42nd Street. fetish boutique and getting acquainted with prisoners. Allysson is an obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with murderous tendencies who like to take off their shirt and provide a movie with some T&A between history bouts; Harriet is a young ex-mother who let her baby die in a silly accident and now runs on a crazy old doll who is also murderously protecting; Seargant is a real ugly [and implicated Vietnamese veterinarian] who, by his negligence, led to the death of his platoon, and now observes a telescope from the window to access an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a fan of Phish who could not enter the New Year's Eve show and went crazy and like a scarf down the nembutols and other barbituates when no one is looking, and similarly has hidden tendencies of murder associated with her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a murderous pervert who has become obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to slash axes; Mrs. Callingham is an aged poet who serves as a kind of soothing old MACBETH hag before the cat gets tongue out; and Danny is a crazy idiot who has been cast as a random element that cannot control the plot, and who is the opposite of which serves as a real catalyst for a series of tragedies and murders that eventually take place in this dark, old, haunted house. In the middle of nowhere. The house itself is a wonderful set, with a shabby early seventies that is remarkable in its remarkable, with the fantastic use of colors achieved by subtle ambient lighting. There are a number of corridors and rooms in the house with shiny brown wooden floors, spiral staircases, secret staircases, and passages leading to various larger spaces, and of course the basement mentioned in the title - visited only once, but the boy is sure to turn out to be a doozy! I love a dull old freezer where Sam keeps her hiding place, a totally plain exterior that reminds me of a summer home that our family has visited each year and forced us to warm up in the heat. exhausted and even always merry Sam in one place starts to suspect that bad things are happening, though he can't understand what it all means, and Rosie H. is too strong in her belief in her profession that she suspects what is indeed, and while the limitation of actress Mrs. Holotik could reduce the effectiveness of her Great Revelation scene, it is a great shout when all Hell begins to relax, and Brownrigg has indulged some nice shots from the camera in various suggestive positions or stripping stages, show what is a pretty lady without revealing anything more than her contract stipulated. Damage! The real deceiver of the show is Sam, but fans of what I have learned to call Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the somewhat shocking finale, and there's something about it. As Sam runs to protect his friend and brutally kills anyone within reach of weapons within seconds, he either suggests he was one of the main motha before his lobotomy, or the film is CUT. In any case, you will not be ready for the end once you see it, even if you as a viewer know what the score is long before someone else put it in the movie. Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams is curiously the stereotypical old booty of Mrs. Callingham [who appears to be inspired by Donald Sutherland Old Woman from Michael Reeves' 1964 film by Christopher Lee of THE CITY DEAD CRACK, except somewhat ugly the death of a round tip into the eye], which not only predicts the future, but also has the boldest movie that laughed loudly in an entertaining conversation while on a walk in the garden with Mrs. Holotik who is doing something like this - <br /> <br /> "Is Is it really beautiful here. Do you look too much, Mrs. Callingham? asks Holotics the old woman answers <br /> <br /> "It's you who has to get out." Fortunately, and one of those things you have to look at, "get". DO NOT USE ON BASE is available on at least half a dozen "bargaining bins" codefree DVD releases by companies such as Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp.'s HORROR CLASSICS series; I'm kind of like Alpha Video is a sexually beautifully decorated $ 6 release from 2003: <br /> <br /> Dig through the best baskets! But make sure you get one with 89/90 minutes of printing in it; the older 83 minute version is downright confusing to some of them and you really need to see the end credits as it is supposed to bring this sick, twisted and surprisingly fun yarn to its end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe it's not compared to EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but it's a very unique American horror movie and a true age classic that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something that is made with more than just a little brain. Juice and not penny more than absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
