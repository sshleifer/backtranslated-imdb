Pleasant romantic war story that should have more exposure. The Czech piano-playing pilot gives the story a gentle touch. Flying footage may not be enough for air enthusiasts like me, but then it really isn't an action movie. Although it has nothing to do with James Salter's novel "The Hunters", which became a film about the Korean F86 Saber pilots, the dark blue world had a similar feeling, but with a more romantic element to it. In some ways, it is better than a battle for Britain in that it does not rely on great actors. Design this movie with Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called Kneldniky (sp).
