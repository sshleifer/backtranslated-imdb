It's 3:30 am. I just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it's fantastic. A teenage girl has a night passion with her mom's lover and the ruins of every life. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really blame one person. Everyone played perfectly and the story was provocative. <br /> <br /> You should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it. I give it 10.
