If you're looking for an original horror movie, it might be the one that's for you. It's strange and sometimes it keeps on being stupid, but it's just a good looking, pretty sounding and original movie, it never succeeds, except maybe during a long peak. "Nightbreed" needs to be seen for horror fans or for monster movie makeup fans. Boone (Craig Sheffer) has dreams of a city called Midian full of mutant creatures. His psychiatrist, Dr. Decker (horror director David Cronenberg) concludes that Boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn. where he runs into a psychiatric patient who also knows about Midian and tells Boone where to go. Located in a cemetery, Midian is inhabited by ugly mutant creatures that don't allow Boone. After escaping with just a nasty bite, Boone is shot dead by the police, led to his location by Dr. Decker. But Boone is not dead. It bites him to life and goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) is trying to find Boone and get to the end of this. When Dr. Decker also learns about this place, chaos follows. The story seems long and complicated, but it's not hard to understand. The story, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. Makeup effects are stunning. Creations look unique and amazing and make this movie a very attractive film. To add more senses of appeal, we have Danny Elfman's musical score, it is both lush and bouncy, and fits into the movie as a glove. The movies in the movie are also beautifully set. The film is beautiful and the film creates an atmosphere that never breaks. Even playing is good, with the greatest surprise of director David Cronenberg, who gives a great, menacing performance as a man who wants to see Boon dead for some reason. It's strange that a horror movie is so well done. Movie problems ... but there are several, but the positives outweigh the negative. The script includes occasional lame jokes to try to add some humor, but almost all of them fall. Mutant creatures look great and largely behave well, but sometimes it feels like they're presenting their amazing camera makeup. The worst part of the movie would have to be the culmination. It takes so long and it's just a constant chaos. It is a part of a film that moves from individual characters and pretty close shots to fiery explosions from every direction and violence that happens to characters we don't know or care about. Overall, this movie is amazing to look at. It is a well-made horror movie, but what has been said has an occasional failure in character lines and a chaotic peak. However, this is one to check out. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** outside ****. 101 minutes. R for strong violence and language.
