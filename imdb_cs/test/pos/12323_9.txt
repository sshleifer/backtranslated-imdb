So many literary adjustments are disappointing. There are many reasons for this, but it is usually necessary to reduce the complex novel to the size of the script. The dead is unusual - it had to be "padded" because the short story itself is a small, relatively short gem. In fact, it can be the best English language story. In a beautifully spoken language, he talks about the realization of Gabriel Conroy that his life and the lives around him are dominated by memories of the dead. Even his own wife for many years loved a man who is now dead more than he is. Bringing such a story to the cinema has always been difficult. John Huston did a great job. He never gave up the temptation to play it, or use the fantasy technique to expand the story. It's simple and true, with excellent performance. The only slight miss-step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. His rare really for the film version of a literary masterpiece to be himself a masterpiece, but I think his fair use of this term for this film. It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but it's simple and clean - I always think of Ozu's films when I think of Dead, his level of purity and simplicity, and deep wisdom.
