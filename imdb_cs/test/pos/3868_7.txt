The Simpsons, of course, began a Christmas special "Simpson's roasting on an open fire", which had basic drawings and was not allowed to joke loudly, but this episode probably has the first laugh of loud jokes in it and since then the show is just getting better and better. This episode focuses around Bart, who in this episode swaps to test Martin and gets to school for a very gifted, it leads to Bart fixing his friendship with his father and losing all his friends. The episode is very funny and shows what was to be the biggest show ever. Overall, the fans of the show will love this episode because it presents the character exactly as they happened 20 years later. So watch this episode in Season 1 package and enjoy the time Simpson does what was intended. I rate this episode 73%.
