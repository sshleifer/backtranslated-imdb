What a joy to watch this family grows up and sees the same children who are working in this series eight years later. Anna (Lexi Randall) is a beautiful young lady who works for a doctor in town. He is in love with his son Justin, who went to the army and was wounded in the war. And the newest daughter of Jacob and Sarah, Cassie, is an open cutie, so transparently honest she is often embarrassing. A stranger appears on the farm on a cold winter day. He slowly reveals his identity. When he finds out that he is Father Jacobs, John Witting, he thought long ago, difficult questions about the past are difficult to answer. Glenn Close is amazing as a loving mother who just wants the best for her whole family and continually struggles with the forces that tend to separate them. Sarah talked to Jacob and said, "It's all so fragile, this life. Anything can happen in the blink of an eye. I could have died in a blizzard. Think about Justin and John. Probably more sick than we know. it's a shame, don't you think? "<br /> <br /> Life lessons on honesty and forgiveness make this fun meaningful evenings.
