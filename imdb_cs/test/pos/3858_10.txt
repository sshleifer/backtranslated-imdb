Aristorcats is a jolly movie that many people have not seen. It is not clear that many because it only has 6.8. There's nothing wrong with that. It's my favorite of Disney classics, which already have a lot of fantastic movies. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason Aristorcats is so high on my list is how fun the movie is. I hate to say it, but I won't do Edgar for what he's doing. I guess I'd let them take care of them. I'd be ruined by some old bag I worked with for so many years, just deciding to give her the will of cats. I'd also kill them. I don't like cats either, so I don't give a damn. I think The Aristorcats is so fun and cute. There are many characters that are cheerful like Edgar. Aristorcats is my favorite Disney classic and that's final. The cat is out of the bag. Aristorcats: **** / ****
