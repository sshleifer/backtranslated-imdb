I was dabbling in the modeling industry (as a model), watching this show with a somewhat different view than most. While I admit that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, the seasons seem to continue moving from any reality. The show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants because they see that none of the show's winners (or contestants competing) have done much of the name for themselves out under the show umbrella. Maybe it is because the truth is that every girl with a real potential to be a fashion model should not have too much trouble with serving agencies (you can do so by email or snail mail if the distance prevents you from attending an open agency event) ), signing the agency and launching a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but probably not ANTM. Participating in a reality show seems to offer less modeling support than signing a top or decent agency (which has only one competitor in each cycle). However, the show can't hurt, certainly can be fun, and has a kind of spell that works especially for teenage girls, I found. Although I have to add, ANTM can become tad and tedious after watching several cycles of how it happened to me. And besides unrealistic situations (everyone more outrageous than the last one), the only other anger is overuse of "Tire, Tire, Tire!" It seems that Tyra really wants to lead these girls to success, but it is necessary to include the temporary numbers of each of the models in Tyra's paintings. for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or script that "Tyra" has experienced and surpassed? I think not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take a little Tire, come back a little more reality and ANTM could be a 10 star show instead of 7.
