Tom Fontana's unforgettable "Oz" is presented to one of the biggest TV series ever created. Brilliantly written, acted and directed so close to perfection in any form of art (film, television, literature, music) as it gets. Haunted in its extreme brutality, it creates a prison world filled with various characters ranging from compassionate to scary frightening. It is a show that no matter how brutal it goes, one cannot take your eyes off. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with film and television actors enables a variety of diverse and original performances. Although the show is generally praised and had a loyal fan base, one cannot feel it was under-appreciated during its TV run because of other HBO dramas like "Sopranos", "Sex and the City" and "six feet under". And while all these shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right, many people forget that it was "Oz", which was the first entry of HBO into an hour television dramatic series. It was a brave, risky first entry and with it HBO hit the slam. That's as good as it is.
