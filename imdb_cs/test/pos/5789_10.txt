I always knew the day was coming. We all knew it. There's just so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll succeed. But shouldn't there be enough coal instead? And wind power or something. Things to fear for future generations. Then this document struck me between my eyes. Oil makes fertilizer, which is the first time in world history, virtually nobody lives on farms. When inevitable oil shortages hit many things - air transport, many drugs, plastics, suburban life - they will become impossible. But the craziest insight from the documentary is: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that our lives must change without it. Although substitutes and preservation are carried out immediately, at best they will be smooth landings in a strange oil world that (a documentary claim) could begin NOW. is often very fun. It contains fabulous historical footage (sober paintings of dark urban factories and 50's funny funny things) that remind us why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers the hope that the massive effort that has started now could facilitate our transition from oil and make the world a better place. My only complaint about the document is that it doesn't spend time secrets why we find this now. How can it be a sudden emergency? In the 1970s we knew that we should prepare for the post-oil world - and we started to prepare for alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our inability to push President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has condemned us to a hard landing in the post-oil world, why didn't anyone say so on soap boxes? <br /> <br /> At the end, I thought the document was very convincing; and left me with a terrible cold that I was pulled out of a very beautiful dream. This is for everyone who is not afraid to face the very likely near future that we still have time to do something. - Charles
