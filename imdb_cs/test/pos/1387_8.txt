Well, I just disagree with past comments that criticized this show. I think this show is amazing. (I mean, Jasmin Weber was still alive and Franzi was still alive, so addictive!). And I was surprised to find that it was categorized as soap because it just doesn't wear the same look and feel as soaps in America. Soaps are absolutely terrible here! At least GZSZ movies on site, presents real music and more credible storylines. In addition, Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff are largely believers in the GZSZ. (Plus, soap actors are one of the toughest workers in the industry because they have the most challenging work plans). If his ratings are so high, he must do something right; Soaps in America are shown in the time of day, and historically, always had rock-bottom ratings. Give GZSZ a Chance! Trust me, it's good!
