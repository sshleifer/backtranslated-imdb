I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival at the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was surprised by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of the very complicated game and last but not least, the brilliant performance of Al Pacino, who was born to play the role, which was perfectly balanced by Jeremy Irons' equally powerful performance. . The film skillfully explores the themes of love versus loyalty, right versus justice and passion vs. reason. Some might protest that content is inherently anti-Semitic, but they should take into account the historical context of the story and the gentle and gentle way in which it is said in the adaptation. 9/10
