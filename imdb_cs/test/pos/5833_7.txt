Hi To read the entire chart around "OZ" just look at IMDb here to find. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS EXTERIOR THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is a series that not only moved me, but also shows a small bit. From the US prison system, but I have to say (judging by the channel detection program through jail) it is not really realistic. Although I have to say that she's not shy, rape, hitchhiking will be allotted. It's still a TV, so go there for you to think it's realistic wrong. There is a good degree of violence in it, and some here and there exaggerated scenes (plot over the fence above the fence) it can be pretty boring. But remember that the series is almost old. So the times are also changing, and I believe I should judge it in the time frame as it came out. <br /> <br /> As the season extended to season 5, it was pretty good! Until one of them wins a $ 2 million lottery because he talked to God that he hit me like "ok it is getting to the point that I don't want to see this series any more" I kept going! And now I just saw an episode of 3 season 6. It was that cereals gets his brain zapped and then his "mom" hold him down while he drool. Then you see Reilly crying as well as seeing his shot like that (RL BROTHERS anyway) Now this is by far the best scene from the entire "OZ" series, that was real for me! You still don't read that I'm trying to collapse and burn. It's a really good series! And now 2010 is worth the watch! I give him 7 because the story weakens the season. But still a golden glove.
