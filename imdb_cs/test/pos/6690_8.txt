This movie is brilliant ...... without a doubt. Just a while ago, they watched him after the constant annoyance of family members in their sci-fi movies (which I am not) and thought it was pretty good. But after the recent watching of several documentaries about the universe, etc. We've watched it again ... and it's good. Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims to be from another planet. Yeah, right, you think ... but what if his story is so plausible that even his psychiatrist is wondering if he is telling the truth. This is how the story evolves with Bridges passing through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his colleagues from the work of cosmologist astronomers (who some of the Prot data, largely admit it could be telling the truth!) Great movie ... which interests you ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
