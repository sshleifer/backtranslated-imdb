This movie appears now and again on ABC in Australia at about 3 am. It starts with a bus crash scene in London. The movies have flashbacks from each character as the film progresses, plus the extinct photograph of Big Ben returning to symbolize the events that occurred thirteen hours until the bus crash. It took me a while to understand, but it was still nice. If Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino came together and filmed a movie, it could be a result - because of the flashbacks and little stories that are bound and death. I'm not sure of the main character as it was the moment I saw, but a rare gem really.
