I enjoyed this film very well ... and I watch it from time to time. I used it in my music class at the school I teach. Children seem to enjoy it, even if they want it to be in color. The best thing about this movie is that for me who grew up after Heifetz died, the chance to actually see a master violinist work his craft! I was surprised at how “current” it is. Although, references to "reform school" are obsolete. The boy whose father has died and is being brought up by his mother and stepfather .... most of our children nowadays raise stepchildren, even though most parents seem to be cruel. I get very angry when his mother does not take his side and defends his actions against his father's father. <br /> <br /> Music selection is also hard to believe. I find it unbelievable that a child who looks like 8 years old can play "Minute Waltz" or that a 13-year-old girl could sing an aria from Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's really fun to feel a good movie and I recommend it. I wish it came out on DVD.
