You can't help but admire Hitchcock's early work. "Saboteur", for example, is so slippery and fast that it's hard to believe that he made this film over 60 years ago. There are some propaganda elements, but they are woven into secrets so well that things play beautifully years later. You can also get some previews of things that Hitchcock would do later - like using a national landmark as a background. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. In the "North Northwest", of course, it's Mt. Rushmore. You also know things that will pop up later in the "Back Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but don't let the show go. Robert Cummings is excellent as well as oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Check out Hitchcock's mini-western in this. It happens quickly so don't blink.
