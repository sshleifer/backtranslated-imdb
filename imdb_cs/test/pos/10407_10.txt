This review contains some small but significant spoilers. I just finished watching my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! That might sound shabby, but I've forgotten several times during the movie that it's not a real XD Acting is convincing, though acting Masafumi Kobayashi (playing himself, I think ...) sometimes seems a little hockey. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka at Rinne in Takashi Shimizu) seemed to change the level of credibility throughout the movie: sometimes she is really good, then she is really cheesy next time (especially at the end of exorcism and subsequent possession) <br /> <br / Character which was initially ridiculous was Mr. Hori, the man in prison of "ectoplasmic worms" coming to eat everyone, and in the beginning providing unintentional comic relief (this is a stereotypical victim of alien abduction). the end has some really scary scenes. The storyline was very interesting and I was really wondering how everything tied together. There are some things that aren't really explained (like mass suicide in Tokyo Park and where the reborn Kagutaba-boy came), but everything else it turned out well, the end of the GOT should be one of the most worrying, if not the scariest, sequences I've ever liked to have witnessed. <br /> <Br /> All in all, Noroi is a very good N way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD provides great picture and sound (especially SUBTITLES-Engrish English!) for a great J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking up.
