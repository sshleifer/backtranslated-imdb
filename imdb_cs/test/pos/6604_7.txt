Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team and their influence on skateboarding. He also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was run by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, written by Stacy Peralta and another member of the Craig Stecyk team. The documentary plays members of the Zephyr team and is narrated by Sean Penn. The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. He discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his decline in the 1980s and his "rebirth" in the 1990s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the Poor Party of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr team was created at the Zephyr Surf store, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original members of the Zephyr team who talk about the Zephyr past, the competitions they won, their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three specific team members; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three skateboarding virtuosos, and probably the best three team members. The documentary talks were usually voices over Dogtown archive footage at the end of the 1960s and 70s. Very rarely are you actually being looked at by the people we interviewed, but when you do, they are displayed in black and white, while the archive footage was colored. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to prove that the document was about the past (ie, the Zephyr team's Glory Days) and not about the present. The documentary is very fast because we often see impressive skateboarding clips over the up-beat music of the era (for example, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews are quick and in place. I didn't know anything about skateboarding (ie, didn't even know how to act on the ground). I was very surprised that I found this document so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than about the skateboarding itself, so when I couldn't apply to skateboarding, I could cover the boys in the team. Because it was created by real team members, it gives a little more depth and authenticity. All in all, I must say that this is one of the best documents I've ever seen. It gave me a whole new look, not just for the Zephyr team, but for the whole skateboarding. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
