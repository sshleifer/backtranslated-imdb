* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need more proof that Tsai Ming-liang is one of the most original and provocative filmmakers who work anywhere today? Check out this movie. Working from the mild variations of the theme that mostly goes through his work is a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case, between a man and a woman who are upstairs / on the ground floor of neighbors - and how diverse the structure (real or psychological) people walls of modernism break apart. Here, a woman (a neighbor on the ground floor) tries to endure, because her apartment is flooded with a marvelous escape from the mountains. The plumber tries to find the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a big hole in the floor. Already isolated and desperate (both figures are several residents of a residential project who have not gone through a mysterious, almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole that connects the two apartments works first as another in a long line of outrage, but soon begins to take on an almost mythical dimension. Tsai's sense of humor and sense of film history is portrayed with a little more than usual - as the occasional dreams of a woman turning around her neighbor above are shown as musical numbers (set to music by Grace Chang) that explodes from the screen in short pieces of sensual, surrealistic romance and humor - quite reminiscent of the big screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And for all the ennui and alienation shown here, Tsai's skewers of the late 90's, the pre-minute tension is funny, absurd, and gives this film a very appealing grit. The last scene is extraordinary. Meanwhile, Tsai - in a typical fashion - cheats most of the usual expectations or prejudices that Westerners bring to Asian cinematography with unflinching, ill-advised directness aimed at absurd tendencies. human mind and most absolute mundanity. There is complete, unwavering demystification of almost everything about his characters, overcoming behind the scenes or most of the cultural significance (which enhances the character's isolation), so THE HOLE - and his other films - are rather disorienting, but also always fascinating and insightful.
