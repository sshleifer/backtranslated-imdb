This is one of the few films of this type that I have checked and enjoyed. While Clint Eastwood is his usual self, the overall story works well, even within the limits of Washington DC <br /> Theme: The attacker follows the president, and there is only one person who can save him. It can't be easy to make a movie that viewers are enjoying these days. This film has succeeded on several levels. Eastwood is his usual underrated hero who wants to save the president since Kennedy. He is doing well in this role, as is his film, Reneee Russo (FBI Agent). Well done and exciting overall with extra stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
