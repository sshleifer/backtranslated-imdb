CELL fascinated me at first sight. I was a little surprised because the story of this movie is completely boring. If he had no story, the film would be better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" comes into my mind - a film without a story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But CELL is first a Hollywood-film, and only a second piece of art. I'm very interested in another Tars project. An Indian Indian Hamlet could be very interesting, especially when it looks like CELL. <br /> <br /> For movie music lovers: Howard Shore's score for The CELL is absolutely amazing, but it's a listening experience. very modernistic style.
