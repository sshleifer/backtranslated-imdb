The Black Castle is one of those films that found its way into Boris Karloff's collection and is mistaken for horror. While there are some horror elements in Nathan Juran's movie, it's really a more genre piece that is solidly made and efficiently displayed. Joining Karloff, in a small but critical role, are Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It is made, surprisingly, by Universal International Pictures. The plot sees Greene's English master traveling to the castle home of the sinister Count von Bruno {McNally}. Watching the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is full of danger and surprise at every turn. <br /> <br /> All that the fans of the old dark house / castle may wish for. True good and bad guys, a fair girl, dark horns for doing dark deeds, diabolical traps, ticking the finals of the hours and even getting a good old-fashioned piece of swing into the negotiations. The cast is based on effective performances, especially Greene and the grinning McNally. While Jerry Sackheim is a slim and unnecessary filler, he is so often involved in a similar movie of this ilk. A highly recommended film, assuming that Karloff fans understand it's not really Karloff, and perhaps more importantly, horror fans don't expect blood to be the order of the day. A gentle atmospheric story with a sense of fear throughout, The Black Castle is a great viewing experience. 7/10
