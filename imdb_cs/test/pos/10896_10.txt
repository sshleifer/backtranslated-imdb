Since I was allowed to play Goldeneye again, it was impossible for me to get out of it. I was surprised that I could leave without her. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest games of all time. I've never played any other shooting games, but I know this is especially true. Most people blame it for excessive violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be several graphic antics, but there is much worse there. And most importantly, it's fun. With an amazing arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you'll go through several challenging levels from the movie, complete key goals, and deflect guards. There are tons of awesome scams to get, and even two secret levels that you'll only earn if you have real skills. Goldeneye is also one of the biggest multiplayer games. You can choose several characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws), and guards in the game. Chances are you and your partner (s) will laugh as hard as you blow each other that you will look like Bart and Lisa Simpson who watch the episode of Itchy and Scratchy. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a game, don't borrow it: Just buy it. It's too good to be true. For cool Goldeneye stuff, check out the Detstar.com Goldeneye website. Every James Bond lover will play this great game.
