You know I saw a lot of miserable Hong Kong movies in terms of production and was good. But running from TIme was great. I think what has done so well was the fact that Andy Lau and Ching Wang have such great chemistry. The film initially is really fast, but slows down not enough to get noticed which is also good, we don't want to have a heart attack, lol. When it comes to conspiracy, there are many other things that interest you. Lau has some pretty good moments when she uses make up to impersonate people from underworld. Also, the film has the best oriental cast from the "Flying Dagger House". The movie is great because its so quirky and leaves you wondering at every corner. Definitely a good rental with a pile of comedy, action and excitement pact in one, 8 out of 10
