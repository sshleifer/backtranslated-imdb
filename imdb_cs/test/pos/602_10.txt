Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piglet and Animal. Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr. Hunnydew and Zoot. Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. Portraits by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. This is the first Muppet movie of billions of others who came out and is also the best, by far! This handles Kermit Frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting other characters along the way. This movie, along with being already good, has great Muppets songs, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That ?, Moving Right and more. This film, unlike other Muppet films, has a strong sentimental value for me. It's such a nice movie. It is also known that it's many portraits featuring Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> my rating-plus. 109 min. rated by G.
