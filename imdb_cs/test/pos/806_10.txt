This film deserves 20/10 if I could give it. "The HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercule Poirot and a twist at the end fools most people. I am very glad that this film remained true to the novel. There was no major difference I could see. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story before the novel. Acting was excellent and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in his roles. In no other film I have ever seen, has Poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! Producers' Hats - They've made a movie that will be with many others for a long time and come!
