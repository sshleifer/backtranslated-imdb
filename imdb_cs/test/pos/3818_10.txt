It makes no sense to compare it with the original series. Although the appearance and content are different, they are both true to the original idea. This is a series of SF / horror anthologies. Because of indifferent planning in Australia, I just managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The first episode really gave me mold (nightmares at my age ...!), But many others fell to the ground; in general, when stories moved into horror realms and far from SF. I hope the DVDs finally get to us.
