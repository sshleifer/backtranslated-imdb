I just saw Eddie Monroe and I was impressed. The story was easy to walk, as the plot melted to a surprising end. Pleasing performances, events, humor and drama have appeared on the screen. Topnotch playing by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. It is the best film that Fred Carpenter has to this day, to be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe it's a low budget, independent movie. Imagine what Carpenter can do with the Hollywood budget. The latest film by Paul Regina and he is very miss and love all. He was an amazing, successful, talented actor and a great human being. He will follow us and never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great work for all who participated in this film. Several rare scenes steal and humorous portraits to break serious content. You will enjoy this movie, go look!
