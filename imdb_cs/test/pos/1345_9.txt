OhMyGAWD !!! MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my liveliest memories of the 1970s. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes that picked up a laughing patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argue with annoying pink squirrels named Sherlock who lived in their trees. They could also tempt the middle acoustic guitar and sing a nice tune. That was a big children's show. Feeling 70 years old. But that's the problem: they don't mention it that way. Pity that. You could say these two girls really had the hearts of gold and beloved children, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those who show that if they came out with a box, people bought it because his MELLOW walks on Memory Lane.
