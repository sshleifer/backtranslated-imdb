Yes, it is, and for the most part, it plays as "after school special", for slightly more adult viewers, maybe a teenage audience. But add to Bill Murray (who already shows some dramatic as well as his usual comedy talent) a nice backing and unexpected sweetness that he grew up and remembered the great or not so great days at the summer camp, pleasing, funny, sleeper hit. It's a bit of smarm for your own good, but it's also one of his charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs" and you see a poster, you expect you to enjoy teen sex, but what you get is a sentimental but sometimes sexy look at those years that are at summer camp. Religion and races of simpler times remind me of the "Christmas Story" that I also love. The memories of the summer camp have never been so good. The only movie I saw is "Indian Summer", which I like almost as much as "Meatballs" and also stars Matt Craven. Hopefully he will complete the trilogy. Maybe he could go back to "Return of the Meatballs," and return to the franchise some dignity (Meatballs 2 to 4 bare no similarities to the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" are easy on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not even blame). It's a wonderful little movie that always smiles.
