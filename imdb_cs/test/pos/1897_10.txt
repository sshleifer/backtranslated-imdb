The best thing is bad, it's a good movie. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether I am dealing with everyday life or a pimp who is blocking, I can always look at it for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. Nobody's bad. Watch the Dolemite as he and his army of all female kung fu killers occupy Mr. Big and Willie Green. Amazing plot, huh? There are so many single-line lines that more perspectives are needed to improve vocabulary. If you say a few lines from Dolemite, you're just fine. If you're in the mood for laughter rebellion, rent this movie. See also Human Tornado, Disco Godfather and Petey Wheatstraw Devil's Son-In-Law. Can you dig this now? <br /> <br /> "You no business barring, insecure, rat soup-eating, motha !!"
