I was surprised that the "forgiveness of the Franklin" at this year's Sundance Film Festival did not create more buzz. There were times when the laughter at the screening I saw was so loud that you barely heard the movie. The film has several excellent games and a story that really makes one examine the broader issues. You know little problems like religion, sex and truth. Lots of comedies seem to rely on the same old corny of the situation, many will think "I know they tore it out of a sitcom". I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job on this movie.
