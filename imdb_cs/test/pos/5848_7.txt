It's not bad, but it could be a better load, it also seems to follow a basic diet for criminal drama. You have Sandra Bullock as a police officer who has difficulty working with others, you have her with a new partner. There's a closed case, but a cop working the same way, and there are so many corney lines in the movie that you want to scream. But if you can look around the wording elements, there's a good movie under it. It's a grip and the undercuts worked for me. Well worth renting but maybe not buying.
