Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid, and I developed a taste for those exotic cigarettes while I was living in a Manchester Moss Side squat with the most incredible cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After just a few moments, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was a passionate fan. Then I looked down at the floor (or up on the wall, or almost anywhere) and saw my own collection of "little gunmen" swinging around. Not sure if it was a chemical enhancement, but I remember that at that time it was obvious that the obvious Surrealism show was fantastic - that was my second favorite thing on TV at the time (#) 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel's films shown by Channel 4). Radical art lives on! You also have to tune the theme! ... I swear I'll never drink again.
