Cuba Gooding Jr. Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I loved this movie. He is one of those who feel good movies that make you want to get on a mission or something like that. Anyway, I would recommend seeing this movie in pulse! Well worth the admission. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr., just give him his next Oscar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
