I didn't know what to expect from this movie - and I was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently ran into Norman Reed and trying to find more movies he was in. I'm not big to have movies or movies, but I have to say this brought me in a few minutes. Probably because I couldn't stop figuring out exactly who was chasing. This film is stylish and fast-paced, with a story that is credible with location and fantastic performance. While I was most impressed in the movie, I must say that Dagmara Dominczyk was just great. br /> <br /> Give her a chance - it's a really funny movie.
