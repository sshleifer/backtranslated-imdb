This is an amazing movie and is very clever in using a few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - physical and mental torture (both explicit and implied) mingles with a calm and even humorous section. So horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this film is definitely delivered with a hammer. This is a movie I will always remember both actors.
