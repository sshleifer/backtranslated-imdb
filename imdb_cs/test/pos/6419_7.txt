Footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. "Psychological thriller" is the most appropriate description I think. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, finds out she can't remember anything from the last three days. The only trace he has is a torn photo of the hotel. She is also haunted by a repetitive, very lively, dream of a science fiction movie that she believes she has seen many years ago. In their pursuit of the truth behind their amnesia, they do not believe anyone, but it turns out that they have visited the city where the hotel is located earlier. This is an exciting film whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will evolve, and especially how it will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensures that a good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, while beautiful colors and some spectacularly shot sequences make it a visually attractive film. An important part of one and only Nicoletta Elmi, who is always a favorite red star of Italian horror, is a bonus.
