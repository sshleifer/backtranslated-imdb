an excellent, thoughtfully crafted historical drama - well-played, artistically written, filmed in a way that conveys precise visual images of Congo, and with more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about the history of Africa and imperialism. however, just a number of valuable content gets lost in translation, and because of the name, abbreviations, and so forth are difficult to follow. So I would strongly recommend checking a neutral source like wikipedia to make a basic sense of story depicted (and subsequent history) before enjoying the movie. if you have a DVD version, there is also a useful historical background. there is a point to the end of the movie where the character name who then talks to the American accent is actually beep - a simple Google search for "lumumba film censor" or something like that reveals a really fascinating (and possibly disturbing) when it comes to producing this important movie. this film, along with some external research, helps contextualize dozens of other films related to Central / East Africa and / or imperialism, such as hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various adaptations of Conrad's dark heart, and even "ali" when mohammed ali visits kinshasa.
