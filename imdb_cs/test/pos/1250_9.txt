Really beautiful movie. Bruce Willis gives this excellent comedy and romantic actress this film message, and the film brings hope to the losers, who many of us know we are. A gift to all middle ages whose time seems full and empty: there is more in the next turn and it can be big, rewarding and romantic. Leave a recent past and go back to the lessons of the distant past, then go on your favorite flight to your better future. If we could once again live our young experiences, if we could really remember the events that formed us, wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
