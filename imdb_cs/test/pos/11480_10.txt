I consider this film a complete masterpiece - in fact, I consider it to be Fernando Fragata's best work and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I don't think you could run into such a "zero budget" movie as impressive and amazing as this one. The direction is carried out with perfection at incredible fast pace and the music also consists of Fragata's mostly excellent. At the same time, the story is creepy and witty, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Misery loves company", a situation intertwined with a mysterious mystery of mind. More than a perfect recipe for sticking viewers' eyes to the screen from one frame to the last. It's called Neo-Hitchcock and I agree with that. Like the best Hitchcocks, it has been arguing throughout the film, and most of my assumptions were far from what ended up cleverly revealed.
