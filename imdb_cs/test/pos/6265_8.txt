This movie is about many things. The most obvious thing is that the film can be over the audience and how to capture life on film can be a kind of spell. There is also a tense relationship between China and the West, while many Chinese have seen (probably right) "barbarians" as attempting to take over and pollute their way of life. Liu even tries to preserve his way of life on the film because he sees one day disappear. It is also Liu's inner conflict between the loyalty and traditions of China and the philosophy of the West. All these topics are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole Hu. Very nice movie.
