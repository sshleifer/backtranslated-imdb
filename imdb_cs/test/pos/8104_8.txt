This sophisticated and innovative comedy packs many moments that are invaluable and have a great sense of pace, though too long. Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes, he has a dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel, an offensive depiction of Hitler. Then the barber is mistaken for Hitler's tyrant and becomes bemusing. Funny and extraordinary playing of all casting, as co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-like), Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-like) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering). Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss. This great movie contains many fun scenes, the fun ones are as follows: 1) The one when a barber-soldier and a pilot flew in the reverse plane with no pilot during the First World War 2) The Adenoid Hynkel Dictaphone makes excessive speeches including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel plays with a huge World Balloon 4) A barber barber shaves a man who has adapted to the Hungarian dance number 5 Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini tried to keep his body taller than the others in the barber's chair; between them. Hitler banned the exhibition of the film to the Germans because of his satire, and put it in his death list after his proposed conquest of America. The film is co-played by Paulette Goddard, the third of his four wives, they were married in 1936, although no marriage announcement was made later, one time completed the Great Dictator. The image was released in 1940, when Chaplin survived a moral scandal by father's suit but by brushing with the House of Non-American Activities was a signal for the US to refuse to return him from Britain and fled to Switzerland.
