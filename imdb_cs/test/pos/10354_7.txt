I felt the need to comment on this film because it is listed as the fourth lowest rated sci-film of all time on IMDb. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is lousy, but it's HILARIOUS! It's not terrible at Ed Wood's level, it's more surreal and uneven. There are some classic moments in the movie. Brain surgery is rude and brilliant and even more nutritious when you think the movie was rated PG! Gor chased his dolly before he poured out the acid battery on his face - "Mine! Gimmee!" Speeches by Zandor Vorkoff at the beginning of the film - "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation who tried to free himself from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has great lines - "No, Gor! No!" "You want the keys, no, my premonitions?" It's totally wrong that this is the 4th lowest rated sci-movie on IMDb because it's fun. No matter how bad the film is, if it still becomes strange, unpredictable, disturbing or entertaining, it has merit and does not deserve to be fired and rejected. I'm not going to defend most of Al Adamson's movies, but this, along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD GHASTLY HORROR are amusing enough to replace their horror.
