Unfortunately, this film was underestimated but proved to be truly exceptional. When I entered the theater, I didn't know anything about the film except that my friend wanted to see him. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the high quality of the movie. I couldn't imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really showed his character. This film is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike many other films. I don't find it easy to recommend any movie, but in this case I recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> These movies are truly exceptional!
