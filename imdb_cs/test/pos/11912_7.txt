I'm sure the movie has some logic gaps, but I was so fascinated by the fact that I didn't really care. The film takes place as a fun, cheerful teen romp in combination with the Schwarzenegger type of action. It's packed with action, excitement, and humorous moments. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I haven't seen Louis Gossett, Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He is a great, underrated actor and I like to watch him on the screen. I'm just wondering what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he could play in many of those direct movies. Hopefully my assumption is wrong. By the way, it's a fun, edge-of-your-seat thriller and I strongly recommend that you get it. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
