Don't let any reviews (critics, IMDb users or mine) affect the vision of this movie. I just read the land and became interesting. After watching this movie, I think it's definitely worth seeing. It provides a view of life that many may not have considered. But it's not, as Leland says, a movie that "can be packaged in a neat bow and everything package." Other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and suggest that the story is not feasible. They clearly lacked the whole point of the film, which is disappointing. at least <br /> <br /> In short, it is a well-functioning, well-managed movie. The story is not a good feeling, but I feel that if you don't feel good about the movie, you may have missed something. To characterize it as an "art house" is, in my opinion, unfair, but as our company likes brands, it's probably the one that fits. If you find out you know everything you need to know about the world ... I would suggest that I miss it. If you feel that movies should be a form of "out of the world" ... you won't find it here. But if you look at it ... you can find something in yourself.
