It's nice to see a romantic comedy that doesn't have a prissy man leader, it has a solid performance from both male and female leadership, and although the story is a bit long and a little clichÃ©, you can't help but enjoy it. Br /> <br /> I think the story was somewhat rushed at the end, but an extension that would make this story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies, like 100 days with Mr. Arrogant Mr, and maybe tied to my teacher's friend. It would be an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as big as my sassy girl, but still good.
