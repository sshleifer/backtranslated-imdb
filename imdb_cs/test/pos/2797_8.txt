As a European, the film is a nice return to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experience I lived abroad and collaborated with other nationalities, although the circumstances were somewhat different. Klapisch (director) went to a film school in New York in 1982-85, so one would think he draws on this experience. Interestingly, the film balances the message that "one should not generalize" with the notion that "for every stereotype, there is some basic truth". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any known Italian stereotype. German character has several tried and tested stereotypes. But the most stereotypical aspect of film is not a character but a central theme of infidelity. As the critic noted, infidelity is as important to the French film as the British film class. The protagonist and his girlfriend play as not very sympathetic, which I think is deliberate and great. Br /> <br /> It may be unintentional, but some nationals have elements that could be considered a metaphor for their countries' perceived role in the EU. A British woman has a flirt with an American (who is an entertainer - like the US president of 1980), while a Frenchman turns out to be a natural leader (when the owner appears). Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is striking that we see only two non-white characters. One of them is a Chilean woman with indigenous features who, despite the age of our hero, is not portrayed as a potential object of interest. Another is a Gambia-Spanish or rather a Gambia-Catalan man who seems to be invented. You could ask why Klapis chose the protagonists who came from long-standing EU member states in Western Europe. While these nationalities reflect what they would see as students in the 1980s, I believe that the exchange programs in Europe today are much more diverse. The Erasmus program includes some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. However, I understand that the selection of nationalities that are more familiar to most viewers can be considered necessary to keep away from the contrast that Klapis wants to create between Europe of Nations and a bureaucratic Europe. In spite of the smaller sights, I have a great movie that made me think about going back to Europe to live. My French friend, also traveled in the US, has captured our shared feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe were more like the US, I would go on my pulse."
