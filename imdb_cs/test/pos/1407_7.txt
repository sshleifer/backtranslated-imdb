I found West Point as a nice movie, though I doubt I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as another unpleasantly entertaining young man who has an impression at the end of the film. It's hard to believe Joan Crawford approached the party less than a year after the movie was made, because sometimes it looks a little awkward. I'd use a note made by another concerning "Huddle" Ramon Novarr (1932) for this movie. There is a great movie waiting for here, but there is something missing. The background and integration of the church were well used, but I was less involved than I thought I would be. Maybe Haines' character went too far or got too far. His "repentance" did not seem quite right; and what message did he send to run every game in the last minutes of Army-Navy? Where is the "choir"? Likewise, they could take another ten men and let him do it himself. I also doubt that William Bakewell's weak, clever character would sometimes have a real counterpart at West Point. All this is a very moving and inspiring movie. It is a good view of the daily practices of an honest institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point, as opposed to the vapid "traditions" of the Ivy League, which are only half-heartedly engaged these days. As for the score: it was fairly fighting. However, there has been a distinctly over-use of snare drums. Their use for door knocking, scene transitions, ALU and more than half of the scenes had to be somewhat tedious. This rather reduced the viewing experience. I was ready to say "I'm getting the point." Enjoy the movie with it, but don't expect too much emotional involvement.
