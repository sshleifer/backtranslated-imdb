This movie is about a lot of misfits to be assigned to a task that should fail miserably. Misfits drag together to successfully complete your mission. Veseli follows. Just like the "Police Academy" movies, humor comes from mysterious characters on the ship. I thought it was an engaging movie and I would stop watching it on TV. No, that doesn't mean you think about your relative role in the universe, or inspire you to do great things for the service of humanity, but it's a fun 90-minute fun. Plus, Lauren Holly looks in navy uniform.
