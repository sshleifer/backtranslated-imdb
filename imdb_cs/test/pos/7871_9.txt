I saw this short movie about HBO the next day and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, eight different views. At first, I was confused by the way the story was moving, but then I realized that it was just one scene that was shown over and over again to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first you think officials scream at a teenager that steals. He speaks in his own language, which I (and Chris teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. The view of officials will dispel this view. I didn't realize how beautiful the short time was until the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. Hopefully director James Cox can turn this short film into a feature film with the same cast, or he can get us with a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
