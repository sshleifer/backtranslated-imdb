This movie is one of the funniest things I've seen in years. A film that deals with death and funerals without being depressed or infallible. Christopher Walken provides a lot of comedy in this charming romance and I couldn't breathe for laughing so hard. I saw the movie preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded but encouraged. I tell all my friends to watch his arrival in the US. I definitely plan to see it again in the theater and buy it on DVD once it's available.
