It was the best film of 1998 and one of the best in the 90s. Yes, it's tearing Goodfellas. But, as is said, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And he stole PTA brilliantly from the best, and he added his own genius. I gave it ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I commented on this (although I could go crazy all night) are all the people who saw the VHS standard problem ... what do you think? It deserves a full experience. Look at the ratio he was shot in! I saw it five times in the cinema and I didn't bother watching it on the video. Nuff said!
