(Warning: May Contain Spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario lead the way and smile, because this game will brighten your day. 120 stars will require happiness and skill, but 60 will bring you so much excitement! Star blasting shows Mario and Luigi and what they're traveling now! Walking upside down has never been more fun, especially the last battle with Koopa near the Sun! <br /> <br /> This is a really cool awesome game and deserves a place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame!
