The main achievement of this film is that, while racially unipolar, the film still manages to carve a tableau of war portraits that leave a lasting identification with anyone who can see it, and whoever was present at that time. Although good movies can have the ability to universalize their subjects, which is often difficult to do; great movies have the ability to universalize their unipolar objects, which is what this movie does. Instead of carving the context of unity, the film depicts the Japanese in the sick final of the Phillipines War Front in February 1945, making a sign for pacifism or war, but rather making signs of feelings, death, destruction, victory, and war sickness with bloody hands loser. * Far different, and superior, to films such as Apocalypse Now and Full * Metal Jacket, both who needed a satirical methodology of trivialization and depersonalization of US clusters, and the use of all races as one struggle that is fine. but not as spectacular as a movie that uses one race and a look that would look fascist if America were created, to convey the horror of war and to show what it really is. The only way the main character does it through this film to the end is by being sick, hence inedible; therefore, through this character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of World War II in the Philippines in February 1945, and the way the Americans, the Japanese, and the Philippines met in bloody acts of war where you live to die. The film is clearly influenced by the neo-realistic way of film depiction, which is original and beneficial to the viewer, whether at that time or not, for the neo-realistic techniques it employs, conveying all the horrors of war in visual form. forms, whether it be a show of pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Like Germania Anno Zero, Roberto Rossellini, it is based on the environment and the conditions associated with it. Opening a film with a two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, preprocessing and repeating the Event. Through this opening, we feel that combat is human against human and human; it shows that they relied on themselves to confront the enemy in past battles, but now, in this opening, or 'pivot' of Japanese experiences in the Phillipines, new information is passed on to the main character Tamura, giving the concept of cannibal reliance on one another if they wish to survive. The jungle is rough, wet and thick, and the sky is not occasionally cloudy and pouring. We waded with glasses and swamps, as did the lands around them. Nameless dead bodies are scattered everywhere. It is not possible to say every moment whether they are bodies, stones or corn. Apparently there's no difference, they're all dead and sick. Everything dies. All they do not have to feed are rare monkeys and dead bodies of comrades and / or nameless enemies. Tamura often encounters another fallen death. Though crushed in spirit and crushed, some sacrifice their bodies to eat but reject; still, like Hiroshima Kawaguchi like Nis in giants and toys, he will not interfere with the death of dignity and Japanese morality; It is all that you really have to hold for your survival, the dignity of yourself. Therefore, when Nagamatsu analyzes a soldier for consumption, he shoots it for that. Tamura can be used to killing, but to killing disease and pillaging he cannot decipher. He is neither a good man nor a bad man. He wishes to survive, but he does not escape beyond simple straight war. His self was among the dead on the battlefield, not glad to wade and wipe the weak of his survival. The disease he wears everywhere, in all; and unfortunately he lacks the ethical reasoning of thinking, either thinking completely about others because he cannot give up his body from his contagious disease, or think about himself because he sees illness in everyone, even if he still kills them. even if it doesn't hurt. Seen in his attack on two Filipians in a shack. Nobody sees. No one can see anyone. All he can see is the aversion from the ailments and the opposite to health, the heart of survival instincts. Often the hand appears on the left side of the screen towards what must be hope there, in Thule lies its freedom. But American troops blocked it and let the Japanese slowly die in this undamaged dirt. There will also be a church tower that reflects the light from the invisible sun. But on closer inspection, crows quiver wildly; religion is also poison air. Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence on the themes or feelings of the film: servitude to fate, the difficulty of existence under leaders and other persons. His correct Anglophone translation has the subject of heavy debate among historians, as non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system, but a servant to sort out a system that does not accomplish it. criteria for slavery. A way to typically avoid poor poverty. This improves the war theme and the symbolism of the soldiers. It is not important at this time to ask what is the goal of our winning history? Should we be comfortably developed without conscious change efforts? It is not who we are fighting with, it is a question of old history, but why are we fighting? Plane fires are with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa, and Mickey Curtis; based on Shohe Ook's novel. In Japanese with captions.
