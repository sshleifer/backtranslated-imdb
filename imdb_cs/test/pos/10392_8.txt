I was impressed by this movie. I rent Antonioni's films / rediscover them and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing. What eye for setting, color and detail! I've never seen such visual beauty and poetry before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back tears. Yes, beauty moves me as if Keats was moving to write Ode on Grecian Urn. This film is designed for a mature, emotionally and intellectually, audience. Those hoping to see physical action and a soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to see this film several times before I can appreciate it and judge it. This film should be required for all cinematographers and directors. Probably a really great movie to order Kurosawa's dreams.
