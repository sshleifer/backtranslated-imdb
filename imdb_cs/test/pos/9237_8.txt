This movie would be especially fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity ... those whose heritage involves putting the film on, may not appreciate that much. It's hard to please in the documentary category. This documentary is different - his pleasure comes from the terrestrial realism of Indian filmmakers, who are the horror that is around and watching. Whether you've ever wondered how to be in movies, in front of a camera or behind a camera, or if you've ever gone through a painful and hard but rewarding independent world, you're sure to get a kick of this movie.
