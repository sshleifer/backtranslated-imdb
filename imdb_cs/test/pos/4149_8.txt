This review is in response to a submission that cares how the film was actually right. at the turn of the last century, they would have undergone all manner of invasive inspection just to enter America. My grandmother was five years old and grandfather 18 when they came. I just got back from a trip to New York, where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum is actually going through the immigration evaluation process - the director apparently made his research, except for medical exams and equipment, questions puzzles. They're all in the museum. Even wedding photos and meeting room reviews - Really correct! One who has immigrant grandparents should see this film. At least inspiring.
