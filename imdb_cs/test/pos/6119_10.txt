The film given to us by John Waters is one of the most entertaining films ever. Yes, it may be rude, but it is filled with hysterical moments that no one has ever done. The infamous dog scene must be one of the highlights of the film. Not an offensive movie is one of those movies where you always see something new. The performance of divinity is worth the reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. It is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the comedy Gross-out. I know it sounds a little extreme, but think about it. Before these comedies were largely mill run and almost identical. After this film, comedies became strange and strange, but in a good way. I'd give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
