Sex is a comedy, although it is not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot, it focuses effectively on the relationship of film director and crew during the filmmaking process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and, more specifically, the issues and actors involved in filming sexual scenes. Director 'Jeanne' is prominently prominent around the world, because she is the one who is plotting the plot instead of the narrator, and gives us many small pearls of wisdom that we can think of. She is a social commentator about her assistant and other issues she encounters with her new male leadership by linking him to a male stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship means something about human nature? the tendency to be volatile. On the one hand, both seem close; when he is out of sight, he claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses his male pride perhaps in feminist marriage. represents obscenity - that is the reasoning of the director. However, this is twice the irony, because the film we watch is itself a construct within the construct. Of course, this film is more than just relationships, of course. Watching this film is not just a question of analyzing it to make any sense. One can please the natural lighting that penetrates the film. This makes it realistic and believable. Sometimes a static camera is used to capture a heavy composition and sometimes the camera appears to be shaky like a home movie. If you're looking for something fun to watch on Sunday afternoon, it's not too hard, but still thinking: that's it.
