For one who has been accustomed to comedy on television - whether it is a sketch, a sitcom or an animated one, it is nice to watch something really refreshing. Chaser must be the best comedy of this decade, Seinfeld is the last triumph. It follows that the hosts of the Crusader expeditions are repairing the situation, doing "road tests" and trying to get the facts from our politicians to a good old-fashioned way. Although it is occasionally very controversial, it shows excellent quality, from a well done and really funny opening credit to a sketch style investigation (sketch style only in time, not scripted, at least not the ones at the other end of the joke) It is definitely worth watching. Even the most cynical and intellectual viewer will not be disappointed and the show deserves ten stars. All in all, well done for ABC to show it, and I recommend it.
