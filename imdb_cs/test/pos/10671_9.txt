I am a huge space fan and for the first time in 44 years I discovered this movie. I came to it with a 1999 roundabout from space, then a UFO. I went hunting more Anderson's creations and found it was their first live action. What is a home run! I actually heard about this movie many years ago, but I never knew what it was called, so I'm glad I found it by accident. These Andersons were not amazing in their writing. performing completely credible and realistic looking models, the quality of acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I don't think it would look like it at all. I'll tell you ... I'll take good old models through fake looking CGI crap today ANYTHING! Seriously, most rocket scenes looked pretty real. They had it for science! If you decide to think of what you're looking at as real, it's not hard to really believe it. <br /> <br /> Also a lot of details in design sets, beautiful photos, whole look. .. man, I wish I could come back then! In the 1960s, they knew how to make great movies. Personally, I lost interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate that! Bring the models back! Think about all the people who use this style! By the way, I brag. :-) If you like good science fiction, which is very good, you will be watching.
