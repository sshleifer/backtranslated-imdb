Ross Hunter's musical remake of a 1937 fantasy, based on the permanent bestseller of James Hilton, was written off by critics and viewers almost immediately in 1973, sounding resistance to musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of diverse British and Americans end up in an emergency flight from an Asian country torn in war, but their plane is kidnapped and falls into the snowy mountainous terrain; the rescue group comes and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines and most of the population is youthful and happy. Some of the classy performances are not so classy elegant (the sparkling mood of the work, the singing Burt Bacharach-Hal David melodies, as well as the light direction of all the conspirators to make the artists look a little silly). Peter Finch is an international peace keeper who participates in somewhat constipation romance with Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is an incompetent person who sets out lines like: "I'm tired of shooting people with burned heads, so people with STILL ON heads - and usually under the hair dryer - could get the last kick before turning to the latest recipe"; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned to speak English when he attended Oxford, is humorously confident (but why no songs for Chang). Hal David's dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw-declining ("On Good Ship Lollipop / How Christopher Columbus / Sailing the Sea?") And stimulation gets set down with everything that talks about the outside world and how nothing is today more pitiful. However, production is fresh and general handling is strangely affecting. Two-dimensional characters are so excessively serious that they really become persistent and film stupidity is contagious. It'll be a lot of fun. *** of ****
