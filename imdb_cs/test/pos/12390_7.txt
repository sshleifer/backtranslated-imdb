Of course he could. He obviously co-opted several aspects of this excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of the self-described "physician in the World Health Organization" who murdered his family and himself when he was finally revealed as a scam. Emilio refers to his son as a "monster", sings in a car radio, hangs on park benches, and specializes in investment programs that cheat family and friends - all and more directly from the "time" Out, "which came out the year before "No one is life. "It's too bad because this movie is good enough with good play and writing. While Vincent from" Time Out "is a much more subtle character that seems to have a sense of ethics, though sometimes gets twisted to the knots, the protagonist here seems to have no character at all except his victorious appearance and charm, really, the part where he used X-rays that show his mother's cancer to make more money from his father then uses the fine twist on the same fraud to avoid moving out of his luxury home for not paying rent time - it's too much .This guy has no shame at all, in fact he is more like a leader in a "stepfather" than a poor schmuck who is fired and he is so humiliated that he cannot face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a shiny new life for himself, as Vincent did in "Time Out." One could feel the tension increasing in "Nobody's Life" and the violent conclusion comes in. One thing "Nobody's Life" has that "Time Out" definitely lacked was the interest of love in addition to the protagonist of a trusted woman. It is not difficult to understand how a sexy nanny was able to fascinate and interest Emile to the point of ignoring the dangers of her natural curiosity and allowing her to keep the bare less than carefully constructed con. Given these reservations, this is a pretty good movie we've found fun. If you want something that touches similar elements that might be deeper and intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I strongly recommend "Time Out".
