The Suburbia End (TEOS) is a very useful film. It is also important and provocative. There seems to be no middle space with either the movie or its main source of entertainment, with the anti-sprawl Meister, James Howard Kunstler. Although I'm not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism is his little vision. In the case of the new urbanist Peter Calthorpe - the other talking heads - you will finally hear what is obvious in this special TEOS ... Calthorpe does not understand the top oil. I used it as a teaching tool in economics classes to get to the importance of land as a factor of production - a fact that has been slowed down by the neoclassical economy for a long time - and also as a means of education: our land use wastes, global warming, our endangered food production, public transport our compromise future <br /> <br /> Move across South Park! Made by Canadians from Toronto for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video has sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005. One DVD major reseller recently ordered nearly 400 additional copies. The end of Suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1/2 years after its release and it was also available on one of the major online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> Continuing, Escape from Suburbia, is in works with possible publication by August 2006.
