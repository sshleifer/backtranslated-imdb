On that day I was one of the RNs in the emergency rooms, these skaters would occasionally land. They were not treated well and some of them were brought to their asocial personalities - but we all knew that they were talented partners of "wonderkids" even then. I'm afraid they deserved better care than they got. They had an "attitude" in the meadows. I'm so glad I caught this IFC document tonight - it will be at 1:00 again and I'll watch it again! Little attention was paid until the wealthy dying child could talk to his parents to run out of the pool - and the movie really points out that it is a take-off point ... it was an amazing time and deserved to be recorded. Stacy Peralta is for all the praises he is waiting for, and for a long time these Z-Boys can enjoy the memories and contribute to a real skateboarding sport. As for the few "sour" grapes contained there, they have always been and always will be "wannabes" and hangers who never do more than a dream ... The boys lived, exhaled, were. Br /> <br /> I like to see years and even a lonely girl, "Peggy", who was so spoken of as the only woman who won her respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to IFC, I really enjoy getting out on a trip without youth and reliving the excitement of my heart.
