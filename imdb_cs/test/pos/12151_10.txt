If you get a mild enjoyment of Pink Floyd music you will love this movie. The score is quite pink Floyd and of course the cure element plays a major role in this movie giving you doubts about life in the weakest moments. this film also touches the heart with a story of love and people around you ... there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island. the movie but i did that is all you get that is why this movie is 6.1, which is a major upset for any movie with a score like this. Check out the requiem for a dream and a fountain .... just as good a score for our generation, but overstated
