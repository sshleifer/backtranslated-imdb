Good God ... How it ended up in our DVD player I'll never know ... my wife thought it was a new release that somehow escaped ... Never mind it's a few years and in Danish (I think). .. Still looking for an English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> All in all ... the movie wasn't bad ... Good production values, better performances and a smarter story doesn't get too far apart to calm down, dark humorous fare from the sea! The end will make you laugh ... in fact it will be the whole movie. Incredibly strange characters who really care about us are making a movie that could be worth your time ... Without spotting the plot, the movie title and DVD jacket give you a good idea of ​​where this stuff gets!
