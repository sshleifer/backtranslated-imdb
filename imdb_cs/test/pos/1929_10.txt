I remember the events of this film, the wrong fateful cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe, which took place around the world. I was 13 years old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was a knight for his exploitation) completed the first solo encirclement of the globe. I remember it mainly because we got free to watch his return (on grainy black and white television!) And then his chivalry queen. This triggered a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK. All this now seems so curious. Chichester became a national hero, but stopped halfway, in Australia, to board his yacht again, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to try to make a trip without stopping. It is important to remember that it was a world-class pre-GPS, where onshore communication was still unpredictable, never bothering the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit on the keyring and calculate a position in the subway anywhere on the ground, it's hard to remember the time you could go to the sea and literally disappear. Like Donald Crowhurst. Many sailors have signed up (all men then), including a mysterious man, Crowhurst. Basically a weekend sailor, Crowhurst was not a spectacular success in any previous business, including a career in the British Army, Air Force, and as an electronic businessman selling navigation aids. He wanted to do something big with his life and he saw five thousand pounds first prize (over $ 100,000 in today's money) and subsequent publicity as a means to start his business. He signed a contract with a sponsor who proved to be watertight than his ship, which meant that the failure would go bankrupt and soon found himself in a popular character with journalists preparing for the race. The British now always love the idea of ​​gutsy amateur on 'professionals'. (Think Eddie Eagle is losing endless races in the Olympic ski jump, and amateur riders who regularly start the Grand National Horse race). (The last competitor leaves the UK) Crowhurst had to know he had no chance. But too much of it went to finish. <br /> <br /> In a beautiful archive, we see doubts written on the face of his poor wife. She left with her 4 children and, along with one of Crowhurst's sons, talked throughout the film. She was in a situation without victory. If she tried to stop him, she would be considered a spoiler, but then she was upset by doubts as to whether she could save his life by stopping him. In the face of some truth that his ship has leaked and never passed through the South Oceans, and has failed to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and outrage, Crowhurst has devised a plan to cheat. When he settled in coastal Argentina and Brazil, from radio contact, he waited for the leaders to bypass Cape Horn and start returning to the Atlantic. . He elaborately forged his protocols, and made 16mm movies and audio recordings back up his schedule. But as one by one the other competitors dropped out, he realized that he would actually come in the second and his protocols would be examined. Unable to face certain detection, his magazine suggests that he has lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide. His yacht was found. He was never. This beautifully crafted film also follows Bernard Moitessier's journey, an experienced and mysterious French sailor who was second and sure of the fastest pricing when he suddenly left the race, unable to act with humility and publicity, that he would face, and plunged into the broad blue yonder, which he finally pulled out 10 months later in Tahiti. Having spent seven years working at sea alone (though on very different ships to these), I understand the ocean's move. Standing on deck, seeing water in every direction to the horizon, knowing that there are a few kilometers of water beneath you, nothing between you and forgetting, but a slim metal hull, no easy access to TV or radio (even today on most work boats, you feel to be quite isolated), it is possible for a moment to really escape from the duties of everyday life. There is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to try this kind of very long, lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind. Most people would think that trying to raise 4 children is enough adventure, but many are out of the need for self-discovery in difficulty at sea, finding oneself. I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, a former sailor who won the race (and many of them), seemed quite familiar with who he was before he went, which was why he failed to win. on the route, but also keep your common sense. Those who searched for something deep in themselves did not have to be very happy with what they found. Beautiful archive footage from Britain at the end of the 60s is almost a reason to be seen (it looked so bad? I don't remember it looking so dowdy, but maybe that we could blot out the worst aspects of the past?) but overall it is an excellently made and riveting movie. Highly recommended.
