Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although he lacks the emotional strike of Brooks' debut, Broadcast News is a superlative movie, with exceptional performances from each of the three tips and a scenario that seems real and well explored as a tough report. Whatever it is, it is mainly a character film and the other about satire. In my mind it will succeed at both levels under its own conditions. The characters of the film receive a surprising depth and dimension, while satire remains crafty and never bitter. Networking is not necessary because films have two completely different goals and attitudes. The network is also a great movie and is a cynical and tired work; in other words, his mad as hell and pretty poisoned by the state of television. The net style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters filling up the news rooms Broadcast news love and live for their work (sometimes at the expense of their love lives.) They enjoy the pleasure of tension and news reporting as well as the audience has the pleasure of watching this sweet and romantically realistic work.
