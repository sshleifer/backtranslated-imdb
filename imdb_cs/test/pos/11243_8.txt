Sure, it looks like there's only about 17 minutes of real content in every episode, but it's definitely fun to watch. You may find yourself crouching in your chair as a buddy holds his foot in the mouth and gets shot down or laughing and shaking his head when some ridiculous lines actually work. The hosts panel has more good, friendly (courage to say Canadian) style commentary compared to programming American reality. I think people who complain about this show don't get a joke. They take the show more seriously than the show itself. The key to VIP is a great reality show cartoon, sports TV culture and club scene. I hope they do the next season and I wonder if the American version will appear. It is certainly fun, original prerequisites.
