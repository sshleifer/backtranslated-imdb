For anyone who likes the show, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you want more. I loved the way each character (detective) appeared. At least with the end of the fourth chair, they leave a reason for the next film. Of course, my guess is Bayless. Such a series was a very well assembled series of scenes. This is the series I would like to live. Thanks to the cast of some wonderful television.
