This is probably the best film from 2002 on Romanian cinema. I recommend that it be an intense drama without lack of action and excitement. The film focuses on teen life in Bucharest suburbs trough the main character, not focusing so much on the shape of a figure or definition, but more on the anger that he and other characters feel. The title "Furia" means anger rather than anger, but could be regarded in the film in both senses from the actors' behavior. The rather strange love story (not a typical romantic but rather modern suburban concept) is well-formed to the end. It's a charming picture, and cinematography is pretty good at catching suburban nightlife, so it's a nice movie to watch and. <br /> <br /> You won't be bored for a minute, I promise!
