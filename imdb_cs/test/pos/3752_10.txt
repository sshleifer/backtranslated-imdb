The main reason I loved this movie was that it was IMx (formerly Immature). They were at House Party 3 when they were 11, but they all grew up! I was a little shocked by some of the things they did in the movie (almost ready to tear their hair), but I had to realize they were no longer little boys. I think Chris Stokes did a pretty good job because it was his first movie.
