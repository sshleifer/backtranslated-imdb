Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer is not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people would not appreciate the great things that are 80th cartoons. The fact that Rainbow Brite was made in film is a guilty pleasure for many of us to remember watching a TV show as a child. It's true that most of the dialogue is pretty fun and stupid, and the storyline is meaningless, but it's a very cool movie.
