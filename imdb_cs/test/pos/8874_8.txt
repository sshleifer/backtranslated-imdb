You don't see the meaning of the name much later, but you'll get to it in the first few minutes. This Golden World directorial debut nominated (for actor) Danny DeVit, who also plays Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is an amazing film similar to Hitchcock's hatred of one man for his wife's book (stolen) and human hatred. for his mother. Basically, he wants to be Owen a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and has been inspired by murder stories. Larry suggests that he sees the Hitchcock movie, quite ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea to kill Larry's ex-wife, Margaret (Star Trek Voyager's Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on the Train', swapping murders, so Larry must kill Owen's terrible Momma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated by Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen had killed Margaret, and that he had / wanted to kill Owen's mom, but there was a happy ending, when months later Larry and Owen publish books, Momma died naturally and went on vacation with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With cheerful moments, a great director / actor and his support, it's a necessary comedy. Very very good!
