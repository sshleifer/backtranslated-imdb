(VERY Mild Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying I'm not usually amazed by science fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a nice surprise. From the beginning I hooked him with the rhythm, intensity and visual explosion that fascinated me and stuck it in place. I am very happy to say that this movie was the best (all right, at least * one of the best) sci-fi that I have seen in a long, long time. In short, the graph might sound simple - a (space) ship hits an allegedly abandoned planet, and Captain Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell) has to lead those who survive to safety. Initially, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays a role with a very believable replacement style), may seem like the group's biggest problem, but when twilight begins to crawl, the creatures of the night begin to wake up ... bloodthirsty predators, which, as we can all guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic. It's not a conspiracy that makes the film worthy of attention - - After all, let's admit it, if you put it on the ground, it's not * the original * - but the skill it says. The story went forward, not letting me yawn (at least not much) at any point. The director was a wonderful job. It was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real experience. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word; Yes, the pictures shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, oddity, as if something was just about to fly out from under the surface. (Not to mention that monsters were really good work, they looked realistic, which nowadays seems rare [maybe people can't bother looking like real ...]) <br /> <br /> I not only did he enjoy the visual aspect of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film, we see the characters falling apart - some of them falling, some of them growing up - but what fascinated me most was developing the character of Riddick. I liked watching his change throughout the movie. Going further, another thing I really enjoyed with Riddick was incredibly well and originally executed by UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him that "no" (you get what I mean when you see it). [Denying they had chemistry. Don't try, or I'll look for you and listen to me playing with chopsticks until you scream * smile *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once said (revised quote), "Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex", which is what makes it even more interesting. So, to sum up, I recommend this movie - even if you're not really a fan of "space stories". Tension was maintained to the very end, and what is important was we (or at least I was) who wanted more. If you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and so (like my bad habit), you'll still find Pitch Black very fun. Just kick your shoes and enjoy.
