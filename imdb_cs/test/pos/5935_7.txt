Serious Royal Rattler 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> 7.5 / 10 Very Strong Opener ... the heel edge performance was noble as it was during the rattle of the ..over id event EDGES NIGHT .... <br /> <br /> 7/10 Lots of people hated this rivalry, even though I liked it, I thought, that Heidenreich really played his character well. the match wasn't amazing in the excitement that was up to kane and snitcky involved. gets better as it goes on. 3. Kurt Angle Vs Great Show Vs JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good match because there was only one really exciting in the ringer in it .. of course of course .... ..all good title matches .. good pace .. although it is predictable end but not all royal rumble titles are predictable. 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) Vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> In fact 6.5 / 10 is not so good for the guys involved, it has gone too many dry patches , orton sold its concussion incredibly, though it was something anti-climax. 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... btw during the next matches were several segments ... two that were really cool ... the price of rapping on the christian and guerrero theft of the flute number 30 tickets. the action was good 7/10 should 9 if the prize won, but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins (HOW I SUPPORTS WHY) ..they come and take a drop and the whole arena is laughing.
