At first glance, every teenage comedy risks being sophomoric and obvious and fair, most of them being. There are several that have risen above the usual source of banality (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and hope that others may join this depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just a pretext for lightning. Some breasts or a vehicle for some has never been like Tom Green. Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack's thumb Steve Pink and led by likeable Justin Long (clever silly boy in Galaxy Quest and more recently featured in Apple Computer Ads), a lot of kids who don't get to college and Decide as outlined in the trailer, fake false to keep their parents from their back. When they go a little further with the web and the other kids end up writing, the kids have some problems to solve. Well, setting is obviously meaningless, but most comedic lives or dying in execution, and here, taken doing quite well. Long is Bartleby Gaines (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by pretty well-meaningful comically acceptable friends to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting character is 'Dean' Lewis (undoubtedly named as a tribute to Rodney Dangerfield Dean) Martin) aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely limited to short spurs, where he can quickly burn his unique mark of harsh observation humor. Black is amazing here, to be honest, to children, what life is really like (its ultimate line is full, is hysterical) and adult face is passed on to a fake university for parents. But Long must carry most of the movie, and does so in spades; Bartleby is easy to identify and we take him almost immediately. A nice twist was provided by Columbus short character hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to injury and ends up becoming the de facto art school at a fake college. Also notable as Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic nurse's Hannah Marks. Yes, the movie feels good in some places; there is debt owed, from all places, to Revenge of the Fools. Those who are rejected by all others find home with Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the villains are a type of conforming master race with an increased steroid content that controls fraternity (well, fine, brothers are evil) and tries to humiliate and bury eccentricity. pro ?? gasped? crime. But this aside, accepted having fun with the material, and even asking some decent questions about the expectations of college kids and a higher education course. Not that it was a brain sample, but not just another mindless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson). It is a funny, clever 90 minutes that is not a great departure from its genre, but is so intelligent and creative that it is very fun. There is at least one moment in the film when brilliance appears in the film. Bartleby controls the surrounding college in an effort to reap ideas for their own school. When they see that children are stressed out at another school (a few refuse to talk to him in the classroom for fear of something missing), he shakes his head and thinks there must be a better way. As he moves, a stream of children go in the opposite direction, one person moves against the human tide, while in the background, Eleanor Rigby's lead. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance.
