For those of you who are still in the dark, I will not damage Christie because it is definitely one of her best works, and I emphasize that you should always see it when you have free time! If one of the adjustments is to be tracked before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the funeral" for the following reasons. I wanted to commend Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer-companion Cora was brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman actually moves, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person traveling alone on the "way of life." And when the murderer is revealed in the typical fashion of Poirot's denouement, Dolan's reaction to revelation behaves in its finest form: you feel so angry at the killer as you are sympathetic to Miss Gilchrist ... something special in Christie lore. Although there are several inconsistencies between novel and film adaptation, as is usual (will-trade less meaning in film), the incredibly rich post-war England recreation, the high quality of acting and directing and preserving (if not increasing) Christie's secrets and intrigue make these irregularities negligible. Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for making this masterpiece of the murder mystery theater and producers who gave her the green light! Addition!
