I can't believe the Bostock Cup is not yet available on the right video or DVD. I only saw it once, on a lengthy copy of the TV, and despite being a footy fan, I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Famous sloping slope wherever it was, a clueless trainer driver ("Ponty-this, Ponty-it", "I'll take another exit"), a pointless plot; all this added to the sore sides. Being stuck in the US I am desperate for some good British humor, but not enough to spend the amount that a manufacturing company is asking for. Come on, take it to kosher DVD pronto.
