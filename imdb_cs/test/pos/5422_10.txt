I only saw it once - in 1986, at the "Artsy" Theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember seeing it a thousand times this morning. Hilarious ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (taking his eyes off, shaking them back into position, then reloading them) and engaging (end of the world, petty dream) /> <br /> Desired view for human race. This call is simply called a cartoon like when you say GATS GATSBY.
