(Very mild spoilers, basic plot outline, no real details) <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie with enough low expectations. I saw this movie free of charge a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I was expecting a few laughs, but how I've never been a huge Tenacious D fan, no more than that. The first ten minutes of the movie are merry when we look at the humble Christian origin of Jack Black in the Midwestern American city. The film will take us years to the future, the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the emergence of its name. Finally, as the name suggests, the second half of the film describes their efforts to get the legendary "Pick of Destiny". The beginning of the film was loudly laughing again, and most of the film at least kept a smile on their faces. That means there were times when it was a little long; it's just 100 minutes, but it still seemed to be a little shorter. The story is a bit absurd as it sounds, and it's not the movie you see if you want a real storyline. Which is fine, except that a lot of jokes are very hit or missing ... and if they're missing, they miss them badly. The same thing with songs; it is a musical, but many songs have lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then went on as well. I will say that the R rating really saved this film from bombing; His humor just couldn't work without links, sex and drugs. But if you're not a real fan of the band or at least you know you appreciate their comedy style, I would recommend you save some money and rent. "Pick" will make you laugh a little ... but worth $ 9? I do not think so. I was tempted to evaluate it 6, but since I think many would enjoy it enough to justify it in theaters, it seems more appropriate to 7. Just make sure it's your style.
