I've already seen spin-off cartoons like Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great. When I saw All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how Rugrats would look in their preschool age and juveniles and include things that would normally happen during that lifetime like going to a concert, going to school and being grounded. The real TV show is better because Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in every episode and Angelica doesn't get punishment, just as she did in her original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. I also noticed the links to Rugrats in this show and even the flashbacks about how Rugrats looked into the original series. They actually talk to adults in this show because they are 10 years older. This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like it.
