The best of everything. What's the best thing? It's different for everyone, but it's love for most of us. But unfortunately not everyone knows where or who to seek true love. This story goes the whole gamble of searching for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as they say, "we are captains of our own ships," and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. We have to live with them as soon as we decide. Looking at this story and seeing these women decide that they most likely will change their lives forever, we wonder if we would choose the same as these women, or would we be wiser? Who knows?
