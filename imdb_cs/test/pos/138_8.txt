Although sometimes I was the only one in the cinema who laughed, it is the main pleasure I have taken from a beautifully shot "thirst" - laughter. Although the film sometimes seemed to have an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest black humor shone at regular intervals. Of course, it helped that all involved parties were amazing and that I was a little obsessed with the occasional malevolent lady who was beautifully elegant no matter how drenched the blood malevolent has happened. <br /> <br /> I've read reviews that suggest this movie was too long. I didn't think so. In fact, the last scene, moving and hilarious (I think brown shoes ....) bends, was among the best in the movie.
