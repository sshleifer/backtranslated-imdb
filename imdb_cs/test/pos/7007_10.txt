I was addicted to Pitch Black from the first 10 seconds. I went into this movie and thought it would be just another cheese sci-fi movie. Instead, I found a very amusing, thoughtful action film on the edge of my seat. The film goes beyond your basic special effects. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other ..) because Fry is really happy to watch the screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so charming that you're dying just to hear it again. > <br /> The look of the film is breathtaking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges thanks to three different suns is amazing. There was a complete darkness of twilight. I would really recommend every lover of movies ALIEN or Radha Mitchell (which is why I went to see it) to watch this movie. I'm sure you'll look at the dark in a whole new way at the end.
