Frisco, Charles Durning, and Papa & Arch officers, Brian Keith and Berney Casey, breaking the Atlanta crime Syndicate who is on the verge of putting "his man" in the Geror Governor's State House. Busted after spoiling the main drug police operation, with a drug dealer and a number of innocent pedestrians shot and killed, Sgt. Sharks was transferred to vices. Busting johns hookers and degenerating Sgt. Sharky finds a list of girls calling in the Atlanta top pimp wallet and after eavesdropping on one of the girls' apartments, it turns out she has Don Hotchkins, Earl Holliman, a governor candidate as a regular customer. As Sharky begins to investigate this strange accusation, she finds that a good family man, married to five children, Hotchkins is also on the payroll of Vittoria "Victor" Gassman crowd "Godfather" of Atlanta. The high-prize call-Dominoe girl, Rachel Ward, who is involved with Hotchkins is tired of being a hooker and wants to leave Victor's stability call-girls and live with Hotchkins as his lively mistress after becoming an elected governor of Georgia, which is a forgiven conclusion, but their only one slight hinge; Victor releases her. Tangled with Gassman Syndicate spoiled by Atlanta police and city officials, as well as local Chinese mob, Sgt. Sharky ends up losing most of her men, including two of his fingers as he shoots down Gassman's mafia with his gangsters in the final Atlanta Peachtree Plaza at the final break. Statueques and beautiful Rachel Ward as Dominoe are thought to have been murdered by Gassman's drug player Billy's score, Henry Silva, who blew her face off, but in fact it turned out she really killed Dominoe's friend Tiffany, Aarika Wells , with Domino gone in the country. Sharky, who was in love with Dominoe from a distance, found the truth about being alive, and to the surprise and shock of crowd King Victor Gassman using it by Dominoe testifying against him, to take Gassman and his crowd to good, but cunning and evil Victor didn't want to go willingly and let Sharky know before he thought.

Shooting on the hotel's staircase, both Billy's score and Sharky's engineering arch Ark, face to face with Billy's drug-induced invincibility, which interferes with the philosophy of Arch's Zen reality, what can best be said to be the battle of two cultures: the West and East.
