This is the best movie I've ever seen. I've seen a lot. I'm not even a Tromo fan. I've never heard of Trom before watching this movie. I've already given up hope to see a great movie until I saw "Tromeo and Juliet". This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There are sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks many taboos. This film is neither disgusting nor stupid. It's hard to describe in words how clever, fun, exciting and funny this movie is. Music is great and fits perfectly into every scene. The characters are very believable and acting is great. I really cared about the characters. Definitely not just for Troma fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and clever and believable fun, unlike totally stupid and incredible mainstream movies that dare not do what this movie does. Bad reviews made only that this movie is great and something special. Either you love it or you hate it. Like all true works of art, not all people are understood and appreciated.
