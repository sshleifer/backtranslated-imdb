Being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism that I started, I always knew I wanted this movie. But I wasn't ready for how good the document was. It covers almost all important aspects of a single hip-hop element that has been from the beginning. The "story" begins in the early 1970s and follows the development of turntablism as art from the beginning to 2000 (turntablism aficionados warns of it as significant). film. In addition to the excellent visual scratch techniques they use, fast cutting between interviews and tracks in stock is excellent when the film needs speed. Sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds that help with transitions. The absence of a narrator was also welcomed. We are not captivated by the story hand and as a result, viewers are able to make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another side to the story and is so interesting to hear about unknown hip-hop stars, especially those who were where hip-hop was shunned left, right, and the center of the music business. > <br /> Although there are many great things about this movie, I have a couple of grips. The biggest one is the absence of some remarkable DJs like Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs outside of America such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. But if you look at a DVD commentary (something I highly recommend), the producer and the director go to great depth about how they regret that they are not capable of showing them. Deleted scenes contain many conversations with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts. This is definitely the best documentary I've seen in hip-hop culture and music. It doesn't stop showing the true potential of turntablism; I highly recommend DMC and ITF videos. But that is a small question. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music all the time. (9/10)
