I really enjoyed Fierce People. I discovered the film by accident, searched the On-Demand listings and tried to find something interesting. The film is mostly about the classroom in America and it will catch you fast. The characters are clever and articulated, and the story does not follow the usual Hollywood rules. The main protagonist is Finn, a premature but under-15-year-old spending the summer with Osbourne's family. Donald Sutherland plays patriarch Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden, who is also the usual cocaine user and yoke. Osbournes owns a great estate and seems to live according to their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated, but the super rich are different. They are used to their own way. The film is especially pleasant because it has a sharp intelligent dialogue, excellent acting and a story that turns unexpectedly. This is also a R rated movie, so it's not entirely healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and likable in the challenging role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane were never better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's grandson. Kristen Stewart is good as a beautiful granddaughter. High quality film.
