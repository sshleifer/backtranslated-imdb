It is not as well-known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the Swedish cinema of the 1920s was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that's great for his story. The story is told in a "Christmas carol", where death itself confronts the deceased with his past, present, and what could have been. It is, of course, a story that focuses on morality and does it very well. The report comes as very powerful and effective. This is certainly also due to the effective direction from the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. The story is based on the novel by another Swedish author, Selma Lagerlöf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjöstöm himself, who might perhaps remove a few other elements to make the story and the film better. Maybe it takes a long time for the film to form, and the story becomes clear, but when the film becomes form and pace, it becomes really amazing. <br /> <br /> Not only does the film have a great story, it's also good looking. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what is past, present and "future." Sjöström not only wrote and directed this film, but also plays the main character. Of course, playing in a movie is sometimes overcome, according to today's standards, but not as bad as it was in early German movies. After all, this film is more about his story and morale than about acting, so it doesn't matter much or distracts. A really great and effective underrated silent movie from Sweden. 9/10
