Two hands renewed my belief in Aussie films. It took the old place and it was fresh. I enjoyed this film to the end. I recommend this to those people who like Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and in perfect shape for him. Ledger was absolutely stupid and his performance anchored a very satisfying film for me.
