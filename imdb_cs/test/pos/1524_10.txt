The film deals with universal themes where no specific country is mentioned as its context: it could happen anywhere - and, if not, it is. Those who are interested in questions of 1st Amendment, Censorship, et al - but do not want to be bored with lectures - need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. Rickman is certainly an underserved actor; shining in this movie, showing some of the acting talents you have to see (but I haven't seen him yet to do bad performance, even in not so great movies). Stowe gives the best performance (and proves he has one of the most spectacular pairs of eyes in Hollywood) - in two words: stunning, convincing. <br /> <br /> The set design perfectly matches the situation, function and mood. Adjusting the sound will increase to the appropriate effect. The overall contrast mediated by the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device - and a welcome and just a sigh of relief to most of the story's place. The script is tight and necessary, with an engaging dramatic but realistic dialogue (ie how it could and should be). Perhaps the most amazing aspect we are facing is the fact that 1) it is the director's first time; and 2) is a writer. In one phrase: tour de force - with three recommendations: see it, own copy, see it repeatedly to understand all its secrets and understand everything that is brilliant.
