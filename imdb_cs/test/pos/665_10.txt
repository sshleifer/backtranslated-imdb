It's the 1980s, and teenagers are ready for a party in a scary old house, which is said to be haunted by the murder of McGee. After the children accidentally shouted the dead in an unfinished conversation aboard the Ouija, the children are forced to fight to the death fighting with a vengeful spirit that owns and kills all their friends one by one. Sounds familiar? It has. It is clearly marketed to pay tribute to the classic 80s with the slogan: "Excessive violence. <br /> <br /> Not enough to get; It's pure fun! I liked the humor and the way it was scared in all the horror clich√©s, but at the same time they talked about what's fun about movies. There is something you get with this movie you never made with old 80's slasher movies though: good acting. The whole cast was very talented and you don't see it very easy in the recent or other case. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertaining throughout the film, and I am convinced that the writer / director and director will be in their own career. The script was very well written and the dialogue was natural. The effects were somewhat amateurish and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this film admits on the cover was virtually none BUDGET I already know. This movie makes it politely to ignore his mistakes and just sit back and enjoy. Although it is not an Oscar-winning opus, it never claims to be, and props to do so. It's a lot of fun. If you like slashers, you really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and boobies, you'll also appreciate it.
