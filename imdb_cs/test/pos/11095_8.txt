This film is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place at the time of Whitlam's disintegration, where Christopher was dedicated to secret correspondence during his tenure as a TRW official, admitting the CIA's involvement in Australian political and trade union circles. The film shows several scenes involving Gough Whitlam (transmitted via American television) where events that confirm the classified documents that Christopher had previously read are held. Removing Gough Whitlam was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the movie, it has been mentioned that most people have no idea of ​​the level of fraud that goes on, eventually ensuring that the US is used as a means of promoting certain policies on command of each other. Nothing has changed in today's age. Christopher's life was deeply affected, read shocked, by his knowledge of what and how the CIA shapes foreign democracies, including the allied democracies to the United States. Christopher responded, probably not in the best way at the time, by selling top secret information to the Soviet Union with Daunton Lee performing as his exchange. Finally, Christopher and Daunton were captured and sentenced for treason. On 23. May 1982, while Christopher Boyce served in an American prison, he agreed to one and only interview with Ray Martin of 60 minutes of Australia because it was an Australian connection that deeply influenced him. This caused a stir in the Australian media for about a week, then it disappeared. I liked the symbolism of the Falcon movie, and Chris was called Falcon and Daunton the Snowman, but in fact the title "Falcon" wasn't something Chris used. Christopher Boyce: A Criminal or a Conscience Man? You decide. <br /> <br /> Sources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
