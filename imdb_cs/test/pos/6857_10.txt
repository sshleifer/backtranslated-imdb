With Anatomy, a German film producer tried to do something completely new. Usually there are only drama or comedy movies - the horror genre is (or was) brand new at the time. The story is also new and shocking. Frank Potente plays his role brilliantly and I bet you won't find out who the killer is. It is possible but difficult. A really great movie with lots of talented actors.
