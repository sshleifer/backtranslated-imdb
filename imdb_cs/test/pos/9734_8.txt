Six-shooter, Sergeant Tunnel, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops, and Blade help the young Andr√© Toulon see the followers of Setk's Egyption in the best sequel to this series. <br /> <br /> The retro puppet master is atmospheric with many sets, quality acting and fun FX puppet. What it lacks in gore, it forms for an interesting well-paced plot. Best Quotes: Dr. Death: "Don't you know, my friends? Smell of sulfur, see smoke ..." <br /> <br /> This is the best movie I've ever seen by Dave DeCoteau. Actors are doing more than a trustworthy job: Jack Donner as "Azfel" turns into an inspired show and young Toulon is doing well with puppets. Oh, and the ring needle is fine. John Massari scores is a nice symphonic take on the original tune of the puppet master Richard Band, keeping the film playful and scary. It is rare for Full Moon scores to actually add something to the movie, and this does. Unfortunately, Dave Allen doesn't seem to be reasonably priced for Band and Co. and so on, so that all puppet action is done with a stick and a string. There is no stopping motion, such as the famous and funny scene in the original, where Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And, of course, as with all the full-year rides this year, RPMs were shot around Castel Studios in Bucharest, so most bit parts were occupied by Romanians: hearing their "Parisian accents" was a bit unpleasant. All in all, it's probably one of the top-10 Full Moon movies. It's definitely the most urgent sequel to a puppet master.
