Doctor Who will deliver the goods with a bucket. He has humor ("You just do it as you go together!" "Yup, but I'm doing it brilliantly"), actions, monsters (in this case, more and more cyber cybernets), tragedy and terrifying tactics. In short, what the doctor ordered (pun). The way emotions move from one to another is done so well that there is no sense of "getting into it". So, 3 of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then weeped you and made you "eek". <br /> <br /> When it comes to character development, it's clearly for clinics. Noel Clarke is Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the Doctor's companions, you know he'll do the right thing, and even suspect he does. But it is still an emotional key when it confirms its future path. While "The Rise of Cybermasters" had a more sinister increase in horror, "age of steel" is all out of the blast. Like "Alien" compared to "Aliens" - as true classics, but in different ways. Can the series keep it at that level? Hopefully.
