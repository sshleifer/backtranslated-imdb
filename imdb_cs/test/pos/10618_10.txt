This movie is absolutely amazing. There is not one single step from Hupper, Girardot and Magimela to the screenplay and direction of Haneke. The movie can put some people away with its hard sex theme and it's a slower pace, but it's really a masterpiece of cinema ... so don't let it challenging ways to take you away! Powerful and deserving every award in Cannes!
