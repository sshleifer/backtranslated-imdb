What looks like ho-hum Porky rip-off seems to be quite a moving movie about how to be young and in love. The story relates to three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in the city, Gary fell in love with her head. The film goes from being a slippery sexual film to exploring the uncertainty of adolescents. It's funny and sad at the same time. It never completely puts into this love story formula that seems prominent in any movie. You know that guy meets a girl, a guy loses a girl, a guy gets a girl back to the final formula. The formula tossed them aside after a girl met. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. The soundtrack is particularly good and the end is a definite blockbuster. It may also be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
