I liked this movie. Nobody I know I like, but I'm doing it. I didn't like it first, but it was still good. Script and conspiracy may not have changed, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't like Caddyshack 2 is ... I think the movie would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had Jackie Mason. Although I did Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be much better if they were holding Rodney Dangerfield. Another shortcoming in the film that I hated so much was Dan Akroyd. The film was made 8 years after the first. Bill Murray, "Carl," could have stopped working as a greenskeeper assistant and joined the army, you know? If you get Warner Bros. Thought it could make a better movie, too. This was my comment for Caddyshack II. I give him 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could be better but still good. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Caddyshack 1 and are discussing whether you want to see Caddyshack 2, I say give it a try.
