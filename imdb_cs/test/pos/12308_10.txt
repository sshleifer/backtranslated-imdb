Argentinian musical poet Atahualpa Yupanqui once said that some folk music repeats likewise in every country of the world. They look the same, but they all consider it their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film, as I feel it, is about the same music that is repeated all over the world at some point in the history of each country. . First, the couple listens to him and tries to hear the others. Then some believe they hear it, but no. Then nobody says anything and some people listen to it. And others recognize that they heard it, but they didn't think others could hear it. Eventually everyone listens to the same music and suddenly it doesn't sound any more ... Love and poetry, like real nationalism and father's father's legacy ... Why would he call The Dead, when no one dies? The Spanish title translation refused to follow the same rule and we call it Dubliners, followed by James Joyce's title ... <br /> <br /> Nice Irish 1900 movie postcard!
