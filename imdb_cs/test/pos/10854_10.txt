As a lesbian, I'm sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and television as a sad person, stumbling forever between suicide and murder, but has never been intended to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If, like me, you are afraid of Hollywood anti-lesbian propaganda, you'll breathe out the relief of this wonderful offer from the BBC. Nan Astley is the daughter of Oyster-house restorer, "wondering why she can't feel her about Freddy" (one of the local boys who have her eyes on her). She falls? and falls hard ?? for Kitty Butler, male publisher with guest theater company. Nan accompanies Kitty to London as her dresser? Not everything that happens to Nan is enjoyable in this story, and some of the things that it does are not pure - but it gets your heart and its story of triumphant love leaves you with a beautiful lump in the neck at the end. If you are a lesbo-hating macho man or homophobic housewife, or some brand of religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and believe in love, you'll end up crying like I do!
