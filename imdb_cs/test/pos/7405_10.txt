I have never heard of Silverwing, then I saw it on Toon Disney and I immediately loved it! I also think it's not just for children, and that people of all ages will enjoy it. He has a great storyline, great effect and great characters. I will always love the show, and I hear it will be soon on the DVD, and I'll get it! I haven't read any of the books, but I want to. The show deserves 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. That's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines to fill in, so ... who do you think is the best character? My is Shade and my second favorite is Marina.
