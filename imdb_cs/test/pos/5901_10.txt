Everyone agrees with the technical perfection of this Jutry movie (whose life ended so tragically). When it comes to content, of course, it's a difference if you're Quebecker, and that explains some differences in opinion. For me it's a cinema, what Vignault's "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is to the song. In addition, Jean Duceppe was part of the legendary Quebec. This film can be contrasted with "CRAZY", the current release of Quebec, which is so successful that it can appear in Spain and is also about the 1960s. Urban Quebec vs. Crazy rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that has to be for foreigners and for people who know Quebec from within, something completely different.
