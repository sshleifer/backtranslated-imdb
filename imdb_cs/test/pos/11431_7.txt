Based on the best-selling novel The Disismal, The Missing Star, the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelia, is a story of growing friendship between an older Italian handyman and a young interpreter hired in Shanghai to become his friend. guide to China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is a maintenance manager at a steel plant in Italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that the furnace control unit is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find a steel plant where this part was sold in the hope of preventing a fatal accident. The film is, of course, a journey that is not a target that uses familiar clich√©s, and on this path we are dedicated to an engaging view of China with all its vast beauty and complexity, thanks to Luca's outstanding cinematography Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River, which shows us the coastal areas to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully functional, a Chinese mega project that resulted in displacement. 1.2 million people. The journey will bring passengers in the face of poverty, overcrowded housing and children, who are left to take care of themselves. The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Huou (Tai Ling), who first meets Italy, where his impatience with dinner translations makes him lose his job. While watching her in Shanghai, she works in the library and is resistant to Vincenzo's approach. Looking at his offer to help him in his travels in China, which is slightly more than a well-paid job, reluctantly agrees to accompany him. However, their relationship grows as they move from city to city, its interpretative skills largely show that they are helping confused Vincenzo who doesn't have a cell phone. As they slowly open up to each other, they reveal mutual vulnerability and the film penetrates into their past and present life and into how they got into their present situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) in her grandmother's house. In one Chinese childhood policy, she is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" because the boy's father left the family. Although the encounter between Vincenzo and the boy is occasional, their relationship becomes the focal point of how the story takes place. Castellitto is an excellent actor (though he wants the younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role). However, emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changes from a distant hangdog. Though Tai Ling plays a big part in this role, her relationship with much older Vincenzo never seemed real and the end seemed to exist only in reality known as movies. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors, coming to the heels of brilliant keys to the house, the Missing Star is disappointing.
