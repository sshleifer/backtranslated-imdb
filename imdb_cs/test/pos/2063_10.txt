It is a film that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this film makes any sense of the real world or has no real world logic. It works entirely in your own little world and your ability to accept or not to make love or hatred for this film. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. Somewhere at the beginning I bought in an absolutely unrealistic assumption that the woman who got back into her memory remembered when the past had returned to haunt her. For a moment there was a moment when I remembered that it would be one of those movies where the heroine knew nothing until it was needed, despite the logic of not doing so. "Oh, one of those movies," I told myself, and was dependent on how the movie began on a wild two-hour chase. logic and in fact you need to pay attention to some twists and turns. I like it very much and I am pleasantly surprised to find people who feel the same way. People either love it or hate it if they have ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, try it. You may not like it, but it's definitely worth trying to find out <br /> <br /> And as always, leave the reality at the door.
