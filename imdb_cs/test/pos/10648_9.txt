This film is a measure of the history of the main movie. The use of splicing is a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtaposition Strike (1. Eisenstein's film). Take the scene on the stairs and notice the repeated firing of the soldiers in descending order to repeat the point of horrors that really happened! A highly intelligent monumental film that all film students must see!
