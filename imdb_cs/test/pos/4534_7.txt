I think I don't have too much to add. After more than a decade, I discovered that comedy is still funny. One thing I noticed was the music during the dialogue that was distracting and often made the film very hasty than it should have been. The use of songs is fine in the course of the movie, but the orchestral background is too busy, too inventive, and if the movie was ever edited for DVD, I strongly recommend that background music be strengthened to an almost inaudible level. This cheaper the overall impression of the whole movie and I see subconsciously why a lot of people passed it. The film had a lot of levels on stage, scene and comedy. level. It's too bad that producer and director felt they needed a musical aid to improve their mood. Now that I know, it's hard to watch, and I quietly curse anyone who's been involved in the music editing in the movie. She had all the details of a jackhammer.
