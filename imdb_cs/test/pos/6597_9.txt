This movie was amazing. It's a documentary about how surfing has affected skateboarding in the early days. It has interviews with skaters such as Tony Hawk (my idol) =, and Stacy Peralta naming the couple. Dogtown is the so-called "ghetto" part of California, where there was an amusement park that was destroyed. People started to ride along the dangerous ruins of the park. The Zepher Surf team soon came into being. This led to Skateboarding the first real start in Dogtown. The boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started a phenomenon known as vert skating. They started with skating in drained pools. That's just a bit of a story. It even contains rare footage of Charlie's angels, Stacy Peralty, who make a portrait. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. They will teach you that skateboarding is not always popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
