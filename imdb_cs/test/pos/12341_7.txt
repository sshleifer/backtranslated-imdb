Thorn-BMI is out of business before they stop making films they made as a film cooler. Use of E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of a daughter whose father has done terrible power. Only in the death of her father Olivia found that her father nicknamed Raymarkovich "Raymar", who actually murdered 6 girls and planned two more ways using Psyhic Vampirism. <br /> <br /> Our image starts with 6 coroner cars stretching in and music to match the tasteless discovery of 6 girls. All dead with eyes open in the closet. There were all sorts of objects in the walls, the men of the coroners hauling out the old man as the blue flash hit the ceiling, causing a circular opening to make a bizarre movie! <br /> <br /> If you like the extremely frosty scenes do it for you. If you don't see dead bodies years ago at every level of decline, don't look at it without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling," he has some heart-stopping horror. I gave this rating 7, it's in color, actress Meg Tilly debuted in this movie if you find it.
