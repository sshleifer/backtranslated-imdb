I'm surprised that this 80-year-old above-average comedy only reaches 5.2 out of all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd makes his usual satirical turn as a con, who takes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retreats to California to begin his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he's a cheater is a drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes to be pampered by Ackroyd's new found wealth that has bothered him. Charles Grodin also casts good supportive performance. For my genre, I think this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
