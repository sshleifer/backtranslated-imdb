I'm not really t.v. guard - except for ages 6 and 8 and "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions and I think one of them is "king of queens". It's a classic every decade and I think this show will be (or should be) among the best in this decade. His comedic timing is amazing and can sometimes be fine. On the "more serious" knowledge, the actors more than succeed in passing the subtle - and not so subtle - in their characters - the complexity in their characters without being too hokey. One commentator wrote that it may take a few episodes to get into it and I agree; it is definitely the one that grows on you, but once you are, you are quite addicted. And with good reason!
