I couldn't see Van Damme staring at him for a moment, pleasantly surprised, still having him, looking older, but harder, a little bit like Sly, becoming ever more harsh. This is a good movie and encouraged me to look at all the Van Damme movies I missed in the last ten years. I would like to see a good director to Van Damme on a big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has huge audiences, the last Van Damme movie was Legionnaire, which was also a good movie. In addition, I looked at Van Damme's early combat history, I too am amazed to realize it was a real deal, a very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.
