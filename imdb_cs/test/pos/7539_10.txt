Alistair Simms inspired Miss Fritton's overlapping portrait. It's one of the great comedy characters in the movie. Equally amazing is the character of Joyce Grenfell - Ruby Gates. This is a movie that you should roll on a wet Sunday afternoon on the couch and be transported to a time when scary school girls are scared. has earned our respect - not our ire! Did I hear the remake is in the game with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? Will she have hard work in competition with the master - or should she be a lover? - Alistair Simms. Go and rent it - it beats so much of what's today for comedy.
