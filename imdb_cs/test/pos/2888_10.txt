After 6 months I finally found this DVD. All I could say was that it was pretty damn good to wait! "Rush in Rio" can be the most successful rock DVD. I'm not funny. That's unbelievable! All the rumor that the sound is lousy is true, but that doesn't mean the concert can't be recognized. It seems to me that you feel that you are actually in Rio and watching the concert from the audience. This is one of the reasons I love this DVD. You feel you really are there. Also Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's vocals are flawless, Alex's guitar is still incredible and Neil - absolutely no words. The camera at this concert was very good, I have to say. They gave us a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Kudos to cameramen! Anyway, enough of my torture! See "Rush in Rio". You'll be amazed. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
