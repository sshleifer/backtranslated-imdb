This movie was amazing if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter, then it's right for you. This movie was great because it was taken by a serious Robin Hood and made it something that the whole family can enjoy and laugh at. I first looked at this movie when I was about 10, and I got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, "On Order of Kings Financial Secretary H and R Blockhead?" Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not. not his liar liar with "claw" or saw. This movie is worth watching
