Very reliable fun, as Las Vegas has fun, as well as intrigues, a very light heart and greatly strengthened by Josh Duhanel !! I like this TV show and I think that many people watch it as a form of eskapist voyeurism ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive and many women in this series are very nice to look at ... This show contains Las Vegas legends as Wayne Newton as Intermittent Characters to Las Vegas! There was an abundant depiction of the city of sin, this is one of the better efforts ... Producers and directors are lucky to have James Caan in the show as he is a very perfect actor !!! I really like the Las Vegas TV show and I watch it on Friday, I watched it the same on Monday, but with Monday night football I saw why NBC changed it to Friday ... However, I like Las Vegas a lot !!
