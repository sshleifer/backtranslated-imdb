What exactly do people expect when they watch Al Adamson? Do they expect a classic cinema that is amazing and unwavering and leaves them with a lasting memory? Do you think it is some reviews. Al-Adams films are mushy and mushy and cheesy, not much more so if you go into them knowing that it is already helping, and not necessarily at face value, especially when they have a value that is unintentional. First of all, it starts by breaking the end of the theme music from outside limits, so you know things look promising. This is the story of a wacko cult who lives in the hills and while trying to resurrect a dead body, the leader suffers from a heart attack and ends in a hospital. Of course, Nurse Sherri tends to meet her needs and everyone, and when surgery is needed, she just happens to be hanging in the operating room when the guy passes him, so the ghost attacks her. And Nurse Sherri is beginning to change. She's not a nice sister anymore, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a few small side stories that resemble people trying to burn the body of a dead cult leader and a blind football star who has become a love object for one of Sherri's co-workers, who also happens to be dabbling in voodoo. This is not bad if you are an iconic movie fan, but it may be bad if you are a "Spiderman" fan because you won't like it. Sometimes it actually climbs towards "decency" (for Adamson anyway) but then "unredeems: alone with some ridiculous event. If you like Adamson's movies and similar garbage, you may like it, for everyone else, who can search for a lost treasure, dig out 7 of 10.
