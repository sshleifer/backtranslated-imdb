The problem with so many people watching this movie is the way they watch it. People come to search for a B-Grade horror movie or "It's so bad is good" movie. Jack Frost 2 isn't one of them. It's just a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad movie. If you want to view it as anything other than a screwdriver comedy (more fun than all three totally insignificant "Scary Movies" combined), it's a misinterpretation of the film at basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions. The assumption is simple; characters from the first film, haunted by memories of Jack Frost, take a vacation to a tropical island. The new, upgraded Jack comes after them, now with the necessary powers of the Hydro-Man from Spider-Man; Basically, he can easily and quickly turn from water to snow, split, multiply, and the worst of all is that he has managed to grow immunity to his only former weakness ... AntiFreeze. What's sad about this movie is that the brain of dead fans first Jack Frost (simply HORRIBLE) can't appreciate the change in tone for the sequel. Like Alien was a horror movie, and the aliens were all about action, Jack Frost was a faint attempt at the horror of the tricks and Jack Frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the horror genre trick. Most of the entertainment comes from live actors who admire the service. Particularly humorous among them are Ray Tooney (playing a retired cartoon of a British colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (offering a mad, hilarious spin on his wooden performance since the first film), and David Allen Brooks (taking the once serious completely bizarre heights). The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me. As a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Killer Snowman Mutants, rated zero. But you have to understand that it is not HORROR MOVIE.
