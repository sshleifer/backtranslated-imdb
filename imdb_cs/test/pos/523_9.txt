During the making of this film, I once captured a television statement. Something like, "Is Killingg√§nget now Nazism?" So my understanding of this film has been given to Nazism from the beginning. When I recently saw this movie in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it was not difficult to see it. Oddly enough, I've never met this way of interpreting the movie since I first heard it. These are the things I found in "Four Shades of Brown". In all four stories, the lack of empathy leads to catastrophe: 1. A crematorium worker shows no realistic empathy for dead animals or those who have had to say goodbye. In the crematorium they deal with death and fire, it's almost like a cheerful game. The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father or his boy; in ignorance he pushes a button that leads to a catastrophe that seriously injures his father. Possible lesson: The importance of showing young people appropriate emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what behavior leads to catastrophe and what emotions lead to good. 2. The magician maneuvers his wife as an invisible puppeteer. Just as she thinks she has begun to cut the strings on the masters' hands, she has reached for personality, integrity and joy, and she is back in the wilderness and despair. Their son attempted a rebellion to create his own life with perfection and "good" tastes as opposed to his "bad" parents' taste. The real problem he carries inside is far from understandable: the behavior of his fathers in his own wife's choking in his immaculate environment. <br /> <br /> Possible Lesson: Imprint of Slavery Breed. A father who has been abused as a child gives sadism to his children when he cheats on their children. They will rob them of their childhood and ultimately their heritage. Possible Lesson: If no love is given, you can't give it. 4. Fathers Abuse His Daughter In her, she creates a reckless rage with sadistic aggression. Here the icy Nazi-sadistic manifestation is very apparent in physical violence. It provides a possible background and somewhat plausible explanation for the activities of young "scin-head" behaviors in oppressing others. <br /> <br /> Maybe a lesson? Can Nazism be born in a perverted house? Can the outrageous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life be a long-term by giving the room to sadistic Nazism? Very rarely does the film contain so much. Every time I meditate on it, it reveals gradually. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are excellent. A particularly handsome seeming boy who plays Ulf Brunnberg and who turns out to be the worst of all.
