This film plays Peter Lorre as an extremely nice guy who emigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is in terrible fire and his face is terribly burned. Because she looks so bad that no one wants to hire him and resorts to crime from utter despair to earn the money she needs to buy a mask to hide her ugliness. Where exactly the film goes from here, you just have to convince yourself. This movie I recorded as 8 because for the money spent on making it it's a hell of a good movie with lots of good twists in the plot to make it interesting. The movie could break into a simple horror movie or a crime movie, but it goes far beyond what offers some real surprises. In addition, Lorre's outstanding performance shows that he was capable of more than supporting roles. This is an excellent movie and brings more than most "A-pictures" of the day.
