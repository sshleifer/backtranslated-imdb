Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man who travels on a figural journey to the ruins where he meets twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor (like Velvet Brown) - adores horses, but with animals has a sad history. Mrs. Taylor is in love with Mr. Rooney's sensory style; he takes him home and takes his room and deck with his family. They support them very well by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (as Mr and Mrs Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's tight siblings. The "National Velvet" story is unlikely for error; for example, circumstances leading to Taylor's ride in the "Big Race" are quite a stretch (but were probably more believable on paper). The connection of the characters with the horses and the character of Mrs. Revere are nicely conceived. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the lead roles; there is a balance between the pale "baby star" of Rooney and the exuberant new "baby star" Taylor, adding depth to their characteristics. The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further refined in a gentle direction, photography, and editing by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith, and Robert Kern. Sentimental classic.
