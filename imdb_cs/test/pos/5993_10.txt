One of the two best films of the year. Well filmed, well written, well composed movie with excellent cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great performance in their shows before their film and friendship. Theresa Lee plays her comic role well (although it is much like the female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be a foreign Chinese native surrounded by native HKers.) And I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something I am not yet done Boys' fans have taken over from 1st 1st and 2nd Hardboiled John Woo. Of course, the end was expected, but I feel better cheering the cops than the gang of young gang members. Very nice.
