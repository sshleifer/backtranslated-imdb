"Medusa: Dare to Truthful" is an incredibly fun parody that is a good companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare". Julie Brown's brilliant work is a very entertaining documentary of Madonna (though it wasn't absolutely bold, sharp, honest or true) with fidelity to detail, right on the cover. I highly recommend for Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans or someone who likes sharp and clever parodies.
