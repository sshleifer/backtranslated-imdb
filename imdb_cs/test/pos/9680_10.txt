Being Russian alone, sometimes it's hard for me to get reference jokes about American TV personalities or celebrities. In addition, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most political show on Earth. The voice that works is excellent and sounds clear enough for a non-English speaker. The animations are also good, maybe too good for TV shows. Here we have the equivalent of an adult swimming channel, but there is simply nothing comparable to this jewel. Neither the Simpsons nor the South Park. I hope the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. I don't want to see the whole thing that turns into average fun.
