In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as car leaders leading their caravan to the San Juan River. On the way, they meet for the first time a wrecked car without a charlatan water. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and Denver Prostitutes (Joanne Dru) and Fleurety Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to enter the Mormon Caravan to mask the patrol led by Sheriff Crystal City, who is chasing them. When the Navajoos cross their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. When the car's train is near its target, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take a stance. "Wagon Master" is another great Ford Ford John. Sequences with a train wagon across the desert and hills are impressive. The adventures of the Mormons group are funny and very fun, and the songs fit well into the plot, even though they are dated. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of Braves")
