Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. Not matte how many times you look at the same thing, the show will never be monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't have to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, facial expressions, and face alone are so fun to watch. The situation encountered at the exhibition is simply merry, and the way it deals with them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't get 10 because it's wonderful. Something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laughs. Some of my favorite favorite episodes from the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean Accommodates At The Hotel 2) The One Where He Looks At The Scary Movie 3) Think of the baby (especially the diaper scene). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it's really hard to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to all heights to prove he's funny, including full stripping in one of the episodes. the way he dealt with this situation was simply blowing the mind. 10 of 10.
