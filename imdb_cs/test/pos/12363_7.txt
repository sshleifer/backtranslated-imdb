I just finished this movie and I must say I'm impressed. How grim. How full of despair. How scary it is. Incredibly. Visually stunning, several scenes are put in my mind ... the first look of the phantom carriage ... the soul of David Holm coming out of the corpse ... his spirit his knee, pleading. This film has a simple story of the haunted driver of the phantom carriage, condemned to collect the souls of the dead for one year - bringing him into the current movie environment and then using flashbacks as a means to explain how David Holm ends up in his troubles. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this released on DVD so that more could see it. Everybody should.
