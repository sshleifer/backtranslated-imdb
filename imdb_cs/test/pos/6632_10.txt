Shame is the highest point in a master's career. Ingmar Bergman, a keen, existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland for a long war survival. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give a painfully detailed performance in this alternate, sharp drama. The intensity of the films lies in Bergman's keeping our focus on the minute, the intimate relationships of his two characters - the two outstanding musicians - trapped in the landscape they have ceased to understand. We see how the external pressures of war complicate and corrode their relationship. Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of war to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to think about the manipulative power of the film media by showing us a film interview with Ullman, who has been re-arranged and distorted for political effect by one side of the conflict and uses it on the other hand as evidence of war crimes for brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
