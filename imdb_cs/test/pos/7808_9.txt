Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first Namak Halal (though it was technically drama). The story is nothing pioneering, but the complications that add to it make it amazing. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. She is amazingly good in comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as a dimmer of two characters. The sounds he makes are almost as fun as Aamir's faces. Raveena and Karisma serve their purpose, but they are nothing wonderful. The real selection of the game is Paresh Rawal as usual. The storyline is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and simply want to get rich. So both of their brains meet the idea of ​​marrying a rich man's daughter (Paresh Rawal) (Raveena Tandon), who comes to India to seek a husband. And so Amar and Prem will meet on the road and join together to drive out hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. They must get rid of each other when they succeed. Somehow they both get to Raveen's house, Amar as a wounded guy and Prem as a doctor. From there, they try to banish each other. But things are complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls on Prem and pursues him. And the rich evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heir and her father to inherit money and send his two most trusted but humiliating fools to do dirty work. This is a movie you don't want to miss. Bach! It will be worth it. I own a DVD, its good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't seen it before. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
