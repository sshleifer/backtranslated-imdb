This is an Australian TV series. It's a classic. Stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget that Picker and his turntable or Chet are ambushed? This is a cult television. Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say a timeless adventure. Music and song just fantastic. Final credits starting with closing the wheel, then Keir sleeps n, which is bouncing around, and then that long shot just can't be much better. All 13 episodes are just as solid in the Australian myth and I think that's what this series has. It doesn't matter that the two main characters were overseas, I think it's the key to the show and why it is. good.
