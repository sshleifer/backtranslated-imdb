The final solution is a powerful Christian film that shows hatred between black and white that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hatred was invented and was prepared from generation to generation. John Ellis learned that a black man was a plague. He was so resurrected. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his faith, Pastor Lekota. Will he change his ways? The film is a powerful film that shows the perception of different races that for each other, showing these perceptions with relatively great precision. The film shows the world how apartheid influenced the psyche of blacks and whites. It's a great movie everyone should watch.
