It is interesting to see how the company of the late 1950s appears in this film. Men are delicate, chains-smoking booze with one thing in their minds (time has not changed people all so much, but "sexual harassment" has) and women are in the workplace just going through time until they find a husband and settle down. Some of the dialogues are fine, yet they are charming in an innocent way. I love introductory credits that show a romantic, exciting look at Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some of the scenes shot on N.Y., around 1959, and experience the time I only saw on film and in photos. Some scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who is a hybrid between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) gets bombed in the pretty apartment of Stephen Boyd, he tucks her into & just watches her sleep (like Melanie, wants to know if "something" happened between them the following day) ). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to the terrible Sigourney Weaver boss, except she was outwardly ugly (soft-core), but Sigourney's character was sweet and terrible on the outside. I found it uncomfortable how Suzy Parker's character (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didn't need a man to finish her. She becomes a stalker / lunatic / nut-job when she lets a man she falls in love to manage her bananas after she ends up with her. I loved Mary Agnes, office gossip, with a strong New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Valley of the Dolls" you will also like it.
