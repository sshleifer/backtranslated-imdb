After the fall of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, few but the most prestigious observers could predict such a recent pique in the Turkish film industry, probably based on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Uzak is the director's third feature film and creates something like a trilogy with his two older pictures (Kasaba and Clouds of May) that follow similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer living alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, which was occasionally visited only by his dear lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his home after closing the factory and losing his job. The younger man will stay with Mahmoud while he searches for a job in the city fruitlessly, drinks in caf√©s and nervously watches young women who never approach. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is translated as "Distant" and the film illustrates all possible connotations of the word; The physical distance of Yusufa from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him, and the generation distance between the two men. Ceylan's films rarely contain increased drama, but instead allow full and rich characters to develop from within. tightly framed static shots. He works as a director, producer, writer, cameraman and co-rapporteur and casts friends and family in many roles. It is expected that such a limited, isolated approach to filmmaking will make it difficult for most viewers to penetrate and connect with movies, making Uzak's undoubted humanity more impressive. But Ceylan is a better film formalist than a playwright, ruled by such leading film language masters as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After seeing Uzaka, I think there is little to do.
