This film has almost everything. The action is fine, it's funny, 2 great front men and a really ugly thief that I really hated. Lots of movies don't have bad guys. Just mainly comic villains. He really deserves to kick his ass. Jake Scott really has the talents of his fathers to know how to make great visual effects. The direction is flawless and has an irresistible feeling. I usually don't like movies that take place in the old days, but I really liked it because it is a point of boring, like many other period movies (Sense and Sensitivity, Age of Innocence and Absolutely Worst ... Lady and the Duke) . It will restore your faith. Before most of Craig Armstrong's amazing score. Music is both atmospheric and ethereal and very exciting in action. The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has a very grainy and muddy view of a 2.35: 1 anamorphic image.
