This is the best version of the Gypsy that has been filmed. Bette Midler is simply excellent as Mama Rose.She has voice, gestures, appearance, and most of all, the highest acting ability to carry the role off and make her character come alive. She especially shines in two numbers - "Everything is the arrival of roses" and "Rose's Turn". Other actors are also fine, especially Christine Ebersoll as Tessie.Also good is Peter Riegert, his portrayal of Herbie behaves with great style and credibility. Gaffe throughout production.This film is a huge improvement over the version of Roz Russell filmed in 1962. Since I saw it again, I can say that the three biggest Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Check out this movie.
