Somewhere in the dark corners of my brain cells in my head plays a song. I can't forget it, no matter how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and gets to you! I wish I could find a copy of this on a 45rpm record. Five disparate teams go to L.A. one night. An unkempt master of the game with two beautiful assistants is the master of all the madness that is going to unleash on LA. All teams are stereotypes (this film has been since 1980, before the political correctness of everything went wrong): "good guys", "fools" led by Eddie Deezen, a dumb beer-loving "sportsman", "we-don't need-man-type ladies" ", especially redhead. The giggling twins are also a scream. And finally, "bad guys" are Stephen Furst as a leader. Furst is cheerful as the overweight of free Harold, whose desire to use a computer to decipher various tracks leads to a goofy mess. There are no such films. These days, movies have to have an "edge" to them with some dark figures and other nonsense. Go back to a time when "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and hopeless. So throw away all serious claims and come back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS. . .
