Greatest compliments to other IMDb commentators who asked themselves why this series "didn't get stuck" in its time to last much longer than many other series in the 1980s. It is not true that the show would get worse if it continued. At the end of this commentary, I will present some thoughts about other film realizations, rather about attempts at the Robin Hood legend. First, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us, you live forever. Nothing is as fun as the two, if it wants, three seasons of a totally unique series. And at the same time, he totally agrees with most of the new and revolutionary findings about Terry Jones's history of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, Goths and Barbarians, the Middle Ages and Crusades (... yes, Python-Terry Jones: <br /> <br / > If you have seen those brilliant and funny Jones-Docs, you'll be better off, much better to understand all the historical background of the Carpenter stuff, the writer of Robin Sherwood (who will become John Carpenter's brother who produced "The Thing", their third brother makes music) who wants to tell us. <br /> <br /> Writer "Dick Turpin", "Catweazle" and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Kip" Carpenter, is my film overlord. they criticize his "sword-witch" element or "defectiveness" (taken from Robin Sherwood Webring) of this series (which I don't see) or that have other unbiased criticism that was there at that time and many Now. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you know better about this "Robin of Sherwood", you'll be tough. At first you will enjoy the third season. Not only that: I myself went through it, and in addition, I took my first two seasons to my deepest heart - DESPITE that Praed, actor Robin, left this series because he was a huge success after the series, he was probably offered a better paid role in a totally ridiculous Canadian series called "The New Adevent of Jules Verne" - the name reveals the emptiness of the project. Praed went for money and not for fame, he didn't stick with his gang and relatives, I think: as actors. Actors who personally represent "really" in our presently famous and legendary Robin-Legend faces and characters. The potential of this series could and should be released much more without the degrading content and historical message and rebellious accuracy of current political issues. Again, the change of lead role was forced by Praed's stupid decision to leave Robin Sherwood for a stupid remake-series of Verne-Stories and brilliantly woven into the making of the story. It is still a disaster in some aspects. Anyway: If someone is informed about it and that Connery may have actually advertised his father, but young Connery DID NOT AT ALL "chased Praed away" as I thought in the first place, then you can enjoy the third season. Sadly, the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have critical and free thinking such as "The Witch of Elsdon" or "The King's Fool," two episodes of the first series, A) Funny, B ) historically educated and C) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br /> "Don't trust the lion!" Unlike many other characters who wished to be dead for their own profit, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and how in real history, was more authority than John or others, but used it only for his mischievous notion of the crusade and war against Normandy in France. He killed and defeated much more than tens of thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews in the "wholie" crusades, and his soldiers even engulfed children who were killed from hunger or poverty. In addition, after its capture by the Saracens (muslims) in the Crusades, Britain was pushed out for its ransom, 100,000 marks (at that time, 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30'000'000'000 \ t values) to return him safely, and only a month later he visited England to return to Normandy (in France, where Norman Invaders went first) for the Crusades (one learns that in the episode King's Crazy). For this new crusade, perhaps a sort of revenge for his capture, Richard Lionheart again "runs out of the land of money" (quoted out of Clive Mantle's mouth when he recites Robin in being critical with even the King). Robin criticizes this fighting disjointed decision by Richard, appeals to Richard himself, and tells him, "The poor gave everything to free you, how do you ask them more?" - Richard: "... Give me your courage and strength, not your words!" ... Later, in private, Richard orders the assassination of Robin ... So, the Crusaders were real "barbarians." PS: When I was watching Kostner at the age of 91, I was angry because I learned in school history that Richard wasn't as good a man as Sean Connery showed in his performance at the end " Prince of the Thieves. As Terry Jones said: It's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean plays a humorist and charismatic and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of" Robin Sherwood. " Again: Praed is, to my knowledge, the one who left Sherwood for the stupid Verne series, no one with brains can ever remember or remember.
