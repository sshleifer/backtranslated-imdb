... scratch. Just as the rhythms of the Africans with their butt jaws and the Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into the ears of pleasing steel bands, the city DJ tried to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a completely unnarched documentary that takes you to the center of hip-hop / rap and explores the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl and the perfect expression of DJ / MC contempo entertainment. The film reveals some surprisingly intelligent and articulate "Scratchers" with surprisingly unique skills in concert and competition where the beat meets the street. Good stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghettos in the sound art. (B)
