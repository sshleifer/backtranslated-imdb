After watching Oldboya, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, some are good, but they never came close to the level of humor and originality Oldboy had. This does, it's not like Oldboy in plot or style, but the same level of quality is there. Acting is good with Kang-Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin. excellent performances. In particular, Kim succeeds in exchanging scary horror scenes to surrealist comedy without any mistake. The story is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swing on the vampire clich√©. Direction is in place with plenty of tempo and humor in progress and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It boasts of what is probably the strangest love scene you'll ever see. This is just a great movie.
