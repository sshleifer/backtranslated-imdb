This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time! The director has done a great job showing contrasts between social strata, a situation that is very relevant today in France. All characters are nice, especially Juliette and her family. The development of romance is not quite realistic, at least credible, and it does a great job that shows how many people change for love. I have found that this is the heart-warming story of Cinderella - but one in which Cinderella is a strong woman in herself and herself. I laughed at this whole movie and loved it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who has unique characters, comedy and unusual romance.
