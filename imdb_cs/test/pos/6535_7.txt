Aaron Carter plays in this movie a pop star (J.D. McQueen) (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie where Jane has a huge crush on JD McQueen, a pop star (as well as many other girls), but she is the happy one who tries to spend days with JD and creates a relationship with him, is rather as a fantasy. J.D. he must go to a public school to keep his graduation level in order to make his summer tour. The problem is J.D. not good at math. He finds the smartest person in school (Jane) to teach him. Jane tutors and falls in love with J.D. J.D. in return he falls in love as well but J.D. screwing in and repairing everything to win the girl and make a summer tour. The film is definitely worth watching. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
