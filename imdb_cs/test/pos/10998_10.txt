When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a sweet - family movie. But for the rest of the night and within the next few days, clever moments and funny lines crept into my thoughts and our conversation ... There's a lot of action, classic elements of farce, good acting and Wendie Malick's story is just hysterical. Marking "good movie" denies wit and fun - it's smarter than it seems, just like "It's a wonderful life".
