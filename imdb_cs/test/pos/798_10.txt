I really like Traci Lords. Maybe he's not the biggest actress in the world, but he's pretty good at that. They play on stage, conservatives, reporter on 'T'. It is a great little thriller that will keep you cool. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think that due to a decent break, Traci could be a top actress. Certainly not any worse than some of today's top ladies.
