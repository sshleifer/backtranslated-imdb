Ignore the comment in front of me. The show is a comical genius, the most underestimated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, flashbacks are cheerful, who cares if they have anything to do with the story, make me laugh so hard that it hurts and it's not a good comedy program? People who think it's not funny don't have a sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, his t.v. Show, you can do what you like, and people say it's not realistic, not cartoon, its animated. Reason 2, Jokes are just cheerfully, Seth McFarlane and other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from Star Wars links to making fun of celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the story lines are simply brilliant and funny, they set all the jokes with their crazy nature and craziness, all the more fun. I caught it one night late on BBC2 and never came back, I have all 7 seasons, plus a movie thing (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have a few T-shirts, posters and my collection is growing. I've never had a TV show before, but it was so funny that I had to get everything. Just watch season 3 and believe me you'll be hooked on life, the funniest show you've ever created, and hope it never ends!
