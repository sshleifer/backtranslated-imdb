I saw this theater show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. At that time I was involved in a local theater and I saw some pretty incredible stuff from Dell Arte players, but Bill Irwin built me. > I was very impressed with how a man of his size (tall and muscular) could fold into a small box without a pause to adjust and move on stage in a dead run without whispering the sound of his feet if he decided not to make any noise. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he got up on his feet during a jack-in-the-box / puppet piece. Those who saw this show will remember that as he climbed out of the box and collapsed to the floor with his limp body and limbs sideways, he pulled himself upstairs behind his head, as if he had been guided by a string, and not just his feet, but the full ballet point? and he did it in one fluid, seemingly carefree movement. Just consider the strength, grace, balance and focus of a series of moves that you must take to reach them as they did! Add to his physical prowess his strong and credible characterization ability, and there lies a perfect actor / performer. My jaw dropped as my heart moved, and my heart broke into a puppet image that was determined to be more than an inanimate thing in the box. As for the unfortunate (yes? tragic) would be a better word) the unavailability of this part in the form of home media, I noticed that many PBS works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes, PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately after posting, but they rarely remain on the market for long. There are, of course, exceptions, but these are mainly science and history documentaries; rarely do artwork in print for long? provided that sometimes he did it to VHS / DVD to begin. I don't know why it should be; Certainly, PBS could use the revenue from domestic marketing of their appearances, but not much. It is a pity. There are many things I have watched on PBS that I wish to own, but I'm afraid pieces like "Regard of Flight" are one-time, once for lifetime healing that will never be repeated on PBS and will never be available to buy home media. That really sucks. I'm lucky I caught him when I did it. Oh, yeah? Our local library bought a copy of "The Regard of Flight". And yes? It was stolen.
