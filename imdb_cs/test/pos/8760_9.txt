If you haven't seen it, check it out. It is available on DVD. This is the production of channel 4 (uk), possibly in conjunction with German and Danish television. If you saw the movie, it's basically the same graph. Several interleaved stories are linked through drug trafficking. The story jumps between the housekeeper (played by excellent Lyndsay Duncan) who is trying to make a deal on behalf of her husband who is to her surprise by an international drug dealer (and a generally dangerous man). And the minister, who is rooted in his work at the expense of his family, is investigating the entire international drug trafficking situation. He gets a few eye opener for the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to be in a "problem". He then officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to be taught that abuse (not just medicine or its common use) is a problem and also gets samples of some products (an excellent scene where he is aware of what attraction is and why it is and why is that such a problem). We see the other side in Pakistan. Despair of farmers who hardly survive the turnover of opium production and the perpetrators of crimes. Nonsensical subsidies attempted to make the system rich. And a country so devastated by drugs, but only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the West. Around this, Interpol's customs officer is trying to catch a "Dutch" connection with heroin smuggling. I'm looking for justice for my murdered partner. This is really a masterpiece. Super, undervalued performances by all major actors, as European cinema really does. Especially if you saw the film, they complement each other and present some slightly different views / attitudes from both sides of the pond.
