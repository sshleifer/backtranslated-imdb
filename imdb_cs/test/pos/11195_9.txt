Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first was 1997's Black and White Small Town - Kasaba), is a significant step from his good but erroneous 1999 film Clouds of May (Mayis Sikintisi). Earlier film had the potential, but had a small budget and improvised quality in the worst plot and woodwork from amateurs. The fact that Clouds of May succeeded at any level was a testimony to Ceylan's talent as a beginning filmmaker. But Distant is Ceylan's coming to the international scene as a great artist who has many of the same characteristics as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (though his screenplay isn't as difficult as dialogue, it's just as tense, and lacks Bergman's liking for details - his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconstructs). The vast majority of the film takes place in the snowy Iberian Istanbul (the fact that the snow in Turkey is likely to surprise), giving the film a certain Bergmanic feel and at the same time recalling one of the unclear snowy city paintings by Krzysztof Kieslowski. The Ten Commandments. Natural images evoke the best of Werner Herzog because they tend to go a little longer than standard film theory dictates - which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscape extends from almost precise Michelangelo Antonioni compositions to Woody Allen's cultural hagiography - One shot on a water bench is a direct quote (steals) from Manhattan, except for the lack of a Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes the famous ship port in Tokyo's Ozu story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan does his own art by modifying them and keeping them in line with the needs of his own film. The remote film is a film whose name interferes with the characterization of the film and the feeling that it will have viewers, but the film itself does not describe it because the scenes remain one after the other. Perhaps the most memorable scene and vision of the film comes when Mahmut is chasing his ex-wife at Istanbul airport and watching her along with his new husband when they go aboard an airplane that will forever remove her from life. As he watches it, from a distance, we see just the sight watching her catch her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He pulls himself behind the column and Nazan turns her back into his future. Mahmut is her past and she knows how to move best - just keep going. Mahmut never gets it. Most often, such moments of insight into life rarely get. That some viewers get that film and that Ceylan gets his own creativity skills shows that ignorance can teach if one moves about it. Distant does, though on the right length.
