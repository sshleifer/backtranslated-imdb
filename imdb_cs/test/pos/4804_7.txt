One thing that can be said about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it is an extremely clever movie. It is interesting to note that the film's writers are French, which can explain the vibration of the film "out of the norm" because it does not really fit into what is commonly called "Hong Kong Cinema". The film relates to a thief who plans revenge on some types of crimes with the help of an equally smart cop. But first he must convince the cop to join his personal crusade, and so a series of games begins where the thief makes a cop into his plan. <br /> <br /> Pretty smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (see www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview of this movie or a complete review of other foreign movies)
