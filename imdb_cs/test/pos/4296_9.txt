What's wrong with "Separate Lies" (elsewhere accused of not being "exciting"). It's cunning, soft and a little poetic. (Of course there is Phil Collins' song and James Belushi's "Separate Lives" movie, which is mentioned here.) The real point, however, is that the narrative ethical dilemmas lie at different levels, the film probe. OK, this is not an "in-your-face" hilarious title, but then it is not in-your-face cheerful movie. Please give British films such a chance. They're trying to get people to think about important things like this: how far you go to protect your life (even if it's a little rotten) against an unexpected catastrophe. Maybe you say lies. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. It can endure a lot of people. American films on this subject are abundant, but they usually go much further by including the use of firearms that are not part of everyday life in Europe. Maybe we aren't so "exciting" here, but we don't expect movie titles like movies for films that aren't aimed at the massive public.
