My best 2 actors are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. Ryan could play something from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it great. In this movie, when it begins its speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say" - it's cool to watch it. Robert Young plays a police officer who called them to investigate Samuels' murder (Sam Levine), a civilian who talks to several soldiers at the bar. Mitchell is a soldier who wanted in connection with it - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who only misses his wife. The story is told from different angles. Mitchell and Samuels made friends and returned to Samuels's apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness Mitchell feels. "For years you have focused on one peanut and now it's gone, you don't know what to feel," he says of the war. Ryan is great as Monty, a psychotic racist. Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was re-juvenated film-noir. "Crossfire", "Don't Believe Me" and "Other Woman" are great examples. Robert Mitchum is his usual way of retreating as a philosophical Keeley. Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as a "special couple" are excellent in their brief but telling roles. This is probably the best film ever made about racism.
