This movie is surprisingly good. Ninja combat sequences were incredible. I haven't seen all of Sho Kosugi's movies, but that's probably the best of those I've seen. Perhaps the most impressive battle sequence was at the beginning when the ninja killed about 20 people, which was one of the most impressive ninja battle sequences I've ever seen. Another good combat sequence was at the funeral burial where the ninja provides more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja-movie, actually it was a little different from other ninja-movies. So if you are a fan of ninja-movies, you probably like it.
