Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you were in Korea or have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they see love very calmly. a kind of feeling you can't find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. it's wrong to compare this movie with "Love Letter" by Shunji Iwai, Japan is very good, but it could never be done like Palwol ui Christmas. If you have a chance, please check out this movie for yourself.
