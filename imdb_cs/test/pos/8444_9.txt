Reporter Kimberly Wells presents the smaller side of the news; pieces that don't have much merit news. There is an accident when shooting alternative energy shots at a nuclear power plant. Friend and cameraman for Kimberly, Richard Adams is illegally filming a man controlling an incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevents the reactor from disaster. After an incident investigation shows that there is nothing wrong, Jack can't help but feel that something is wrong. When we find that the weld seals on the generator pump are cracked, Jack and Kimberly and Richard try to inform the public and shut down the dangerous power plant. a drama that is still so important today. Nuclear power has always been a hot topic, whether it is the safest source of alternative energy, radioactive waste, and nuclear power plants waiting for another Chernobyl. Just not about nuclear power, Chinese Syndrome examines freedom of speech, the right of the press, and the big deal. On Jack's knowledge of counterfeit information, his knowledge stops massive investment in the construction of another nuclear power plant, from which many men try to profit. Desperate for news, Kimberly sees fighting for the truth more important than strengthening her career; Richard kept pushing, never wanting to be silenced so the public could learn about the accident. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are just flawless. Fonda shows Kimberly as a fragile woman on her exterior, but emotionally tough and determined to reveal this cover-up. Douglas delivers powerful performance like Richard, fighting for honesty and truth. Lemmon shined like Jack, his performance is highly charged with drama. Chinese Syndrome is a riveting look that is still important today, as it was in the first edition.
