In 1996, MICHAEL is a warm and winning comedy-fantasy that is one of my favorite performances from John Travolta's library. Travolta gives one of his most spectacular and likable performances like Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence in the home of a solitary innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disturbed when Pansy reports to Michael's presence in his home to journalists "National Enquirer". and editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. Hurt, McDowell, and Pastorelli are pretty good as tired journalists who hardly accept that they have met an angel, but this is Travolty's show and he rules like a mushy, sugar, cookie, stinking loving, loving, aretha-loving, bull chasing Michael, an angel you just don't think when you think about angels. And you have to love the scene at the bar when he and the ladies dance to the "chain of fools". I love this film more and more every time I look at it and it is mainly due to John Travolta's absolutely winning performance.
