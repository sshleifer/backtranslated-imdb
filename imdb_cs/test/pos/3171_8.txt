The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, from more or less traditional views dealing with art to postmodern approaches that like to discuss the game along post-colonial, feminist, gender, or deconstructionist lines. The reason Jarman's version left me cold enough is that I had no idea what it was about. What is the basic vision / idea / concept behind this Shakespeare rendering? Previous reviewers don't get much more than vengeance, punk show, but there's certainly more, isn't it? This does not mean that there is no vision, just that I have hardly discovered it. If so, there are things you can enjoy. Punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are amazing. I wasn't very interested in Williams as Prospero ... I don't think that's enough magic. Switching between the old monastery / castle and the (very English) outside world can sometimes be a little worrying, but I think it's intentional. All in all, an interesting but not entirely successful success that I hoped might be (especially after seeing Jarman's Caravaggio).
