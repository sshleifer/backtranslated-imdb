My friends and I spent most of the Saturday afternoon watching a selection of "bad" movies. Among the fast shots we watched, the strongest rival (for poor quality film fare) was Jack-O. It's ridiculous that movies like "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" are featured at the bottom of the IMDB 100. While they're definitely bad movies, they don't belong to the bottom of 100. They're robbing "Jack" -O ", and "Keeper of Time," etc., of the bad film size he deserves so richly. So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)? The Beginning of His Son, Ryan Latshaw, as Sean Kelly, Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously close to being in a block of wood, the boy, seriously, has no emotion at all. could listen to a joke, or just a moment away from the way his head breaks and his expression is one of the stone "ruthlessness". <br /> <br /> Another aspect of the film we found was amazing. double dreaming ". What is a double dream? Well, when a character wakes up from a nightmare, something equally frightening happens and then the character wakes up again. Basically, he wakes up after dreaming of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, right? I believe the character of Sean Kelly has experienced no less than 3 double dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Yeah! This movie has a real cast of thousands. It's really overwhelming to see how many talking roles are introduced during the movie. Best of all: almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story. Either they are killed by Jack, or they serve no purpose. Jack-O himself was pretty sweet. Like most B-movie monsters, Jack-O has an amazing ability to seemingly teleport over long distances. It's always hanging, somewhere in the background whenever it is the main character. But what is mysterious is that when someone is chasing someone who moves at a stumbling / stumbling rate and is able to keep up with the people who sprint. <br /> <br /> That's all. Closing remarks: if you are looking for an unintentionally merry bad movie, you can't go wrong by renting this beast. Poor Film Rating: 7/10 Good Movie Rating: 3.5 / 10
