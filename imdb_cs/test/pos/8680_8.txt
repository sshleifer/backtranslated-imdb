I read most of the comments where everyone saw only the shortcomings of the film. I agree that the director isn't Kuprik, the actors aren't the Oscar winners, but he has something that everyone could be concerned about. I don't want to go wrong, but to tell more than a conspiracy - completing a school and going to a big party, or if you want to see beyond the metaphor, choosing a way through life. Remember those days of youth? days when you or our friend acted like characters? Or do you think you should act as one of them, and now you regret, don't you? If you can go back then, and if you can ask yourself some of these questions, maybe the movie wasn't that bad.
