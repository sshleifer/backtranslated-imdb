I don't understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much, then it's not enough! It's stupid as everyone changes son "I love you" to "I hate you." If you don't like it, well. Whatever your opinion. But it doesn't make sense to degrade the show when it's not that bad. OK, so his corny, and yes, he has his flaws, but his kids show. Children don't want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney helps. And even in the show, there are moments of sadness and anger, etc. And yes, Barney uses magic. But children see Barney as a fantasy figment. Children need a place to escape to comment. The world is a poor and hard place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney will do it to us. This show is great. I was looking at Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people consider it stupid. But I watched it and I'm at the top of my class. Maybe it doesn't mean you're wiser, but that's no reason. I believe that Barney's goal is to provide a place where children can be children and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where imagination lives. So many teenagers are now unimaginable and afraid to comment. Barney supports it. Barney helped me not to worry and I showed up who I was. I am now in high school, an AP student with 4.0, a drama with a love for theater and art and with a new cousin who loves Barney. I look at it and enjoy it and sing with it. Yes, its crazy and stupid and anything, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who has no time to have fun? I'm a child in my heart and I love Barney. Its great for kids and those who are baby in heart. It's a great show for kids and toddlers. So stop hating. Let's say you don't like it, but stop it with the "dumbest show ever" or "barneys load bull" or whatever. Keep it to yourself. Take a cool pill or something. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you don't see me go: "Grover is a bull" or "Cookie Monster should die" or anything. I hate all BULLSS ** people say about books or movies like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, OK, whatever. Nobody cares. Don't say you hate things about it because you might offend someone.
