Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best of all American series. In the early days of 1936, Universal was able to make such a fun story, and twenty years later when I watched for the first time as a child it involved me in great adventure and emotions. Buster Crabbe was a hero we always wanted to be in childhood, and Jean Rogers was a beautiful girl we always dreamed of falling in love with. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also attractive. Charles Middleton was a great presence like Ming, Merciless. The true predecessor of Starwar Jiri Lucas.
