Just stop by for all viewers out there who slammed John Waters for making a movie like Pink Flamingos. He'll get you nowhere. He sometimes took care to stop and think about Mr.Waters' ambitions and determination. If you want to gather your best friends and make a movie just to get rid of thousands of viewers around the world, this person has great ambitions. Just read his Shock Value CV. It discusses the lengths that this film has undergone. Maybe it wasn't just the fact that John made this movie to the gross people, but to prove that there could be something like a good bad taste.
