The last movie, which provided a vivid and disturbing look at what's crazy, was V Dreams. You haven't seen madness in the movie, you were ALSO. The Cell comes along with an updated and much more intrusive image of the mind inside the psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you to the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are both fascinating and then scary. Things that they will later see in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things have never been seen in the film. The Cell Story is not something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as the story of lamb silence. You have a murderer in custody and these people have to come into mind to find a woman who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the grounds of the land is that in the silence of the lambs you have to enter the mind of the killer to find another killer, as well as his present victim, while in the cell you have to enter the mind of the killer to find your own victim. Despite the poor story of The Cell, it revolutionizes the genre of psychological thriller. No one ever came to him. The film also had a good direction and was very good at acting. Vince Vaughn adds another of his outstanding performances (he was as good as Norman Bates in the pathetic re-make of Psycha in 1998), and even Jennifer Lopez makes a second good effort in his career (the other is a great Out of Sight). ). As far as cinematography in The Cell is concerned, there can be nothing to give it enough credit, it was imaginative and fascinating, and it is incomparable with anything that has ever been seen in cinematography. The cell is an incredibly well made film that deserves credit.
