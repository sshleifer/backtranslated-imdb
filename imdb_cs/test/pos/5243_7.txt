John Wayne is one of the few film history players who failed their first big break and then succeeded for the second time. Of course, everyone knows that for the second time it was the classic Stagecoach with director John Ford. Director John Ford Raoul Walsh noticed this tall guy on a set of one of Ford's films and thought he had the potential. He wanted him to be the leader in the big budget Fox had planned to do. The movie, as planned, would be a tribute to the famous classic quiet Western Covered Wagon. While watching The Big Trail I was surprised how similar Wayne's character Breck Coleman is to Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were likeable young cowpokes, but both were on a mission of revenge. And of course both films were shot on the spot and showed the cost of their production. No studio product here has a backlot western. Also, I don't think it was an accident that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era. Raoul Walsh, I guess I looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think many movie cowboys had a powerful sound. That's something Walsh saw in Wayne. From what I read The Big Trail, I failed, because after spending all that money to be a movie in the early widescreen process, some Fox geniuses realized their theaters were not equipped with a widescreen screen that would show it. And when the Great Depression hits, there will be no money to expand these screens in Fox movie houses. So The Big Trail has a limited edition, even in what we call a formatted version, and loses big money for Fox movies. Marguerite Churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are Wayne's three villains to deal with. F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous film legend Tyrone Power. He was a big, stout man with a big background in classic roles on screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son, who was 15 years old at the time, didn't have to hang around the set. Also look for Ward Bond, even if you can meet him with a big whisker. Watching The Big Trail is interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career could be if the Big Trail was a big hit.
