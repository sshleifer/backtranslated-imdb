I am the first to realize that thirsty Chan-wook Park is extremely well done, but spending more than two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for anyone to tolerate for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wishes to voluntarily participate in experimental studies on those who are willing to undergo severe injections regarding a specific virus that kills infectiously. Instead of legitimate dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire who always desires blood nutrition that allows him to fight an infectious disease that causes symptoms that begin to compare him (bumps / ulcers and the body vomiting blood). Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death when exposed to Hyeon for a long time. Hyeon falls into lust with Tae-joo, wife of sick friend Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was accepted by Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy, and practically used as a pet to be ordered nearby. Ta-joo is unhappy in this situation and begins with the oppressive affair he incites with Hyeon. Hyeon gave up his priesthood and immersed himself in a relationship with Tae-joo, soon a willing participant in killing Kang-woo. This incident, to which Tae-woo was involved (using a ship in the middle of the lake, both proceeding to bury him underwater, Tae-woo kept him in Kang-woo to try to restore the surface). he will scare both as the circumstances arise with Kang-woo "missing" (Hyeon got rid of him where the police can't find his corpse). Soon, Mrs. Ra suffers from a stroke (although one finger and eye blinking power are powerful as the story progresses, indicating she is more aware than she believes), and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday present .. vampire. In this way, Hyeon created a monster. Tae-joo admits (even though it is a language) that Kang-woo never really hurt her, and when she thirsts for blood, she soon realizes that killing for supplies doesn't bother her morally or mentally. Tae-joo becomes so full of hands that Hyeon has to take desperate measures to stop such a threat to the society he includes. I'll say thirst is one of the best horror movies I saw in 2009. It's a methodical approach Park takes and we're guided by the dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo because they are doing terrible deeds with nothing positive from their unholy connection. Innocent people are dying for Hyeon's love (..that once meant he wanted to move into obsessive love at the end) for Tae-joo and stop ending if he doesn't make a painful choice. We see in their heads, their souls, and it is not always nice. Two hours with them can be quite exhausting .. but the director's merits for not making any strikes in terms of bad behavior and how vampirism's powers can be given to bad people. Hyeon, perceived as a pleasant soul at opening, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo, so he could look at thirst as a unique love story, but not entirely healthy. As far as violence is concerned, while Park tends to break away from extremely graphic details, it's pretty sadism that might turn a little stomach. At least the way in which violence is done can certainly leave a lasting impact. The sexual situation between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite heated and erotic, and at the same time sordid and morally reprehensible. I think the film is still a fairly complex exploration of the lengths that one will remain attached to the object of affection (lust).
