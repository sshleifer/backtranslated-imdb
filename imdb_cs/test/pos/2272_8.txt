This is rare. All that is illuminated is sweet and sublimely funny from the first delicious series of dialogues. As I expected to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is as charming as Jonathan Safran Foer (the true author of Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (playing the Ukrainian guide and translator Jonathan, Alex), who really steals this movie. Alex is a hip-hop lovin 'Ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find a woman who saved the life of Jonathan's grandfather during World War II. The Ukrainian landscape never looked so breathless. I'm thinking about wrapping it all up and moving to the former Soviet state. However, the film's tone is shifting when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and this delightful comedy suddenly turns into a fragile historical drama about a Jewish village that was destroyed during Nazi occupation. All that is illuminated is about the history, heritage, and wisdom that can be gained from revealing the past. It's perfect.
