The bottom was my favorite sitcom since I saw it at t.v and the film is even better when your bottom fan says it's necessary to buy it !!! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called the Eden Inn, but not all go straight for them as customers leave until the famous actress comes to stay to try there the best impression on her, but not all go well it's up to the British Cinema you buy it and you will laugh with laughter. also play Simon Peggi (shaun dead) and also neigh account (love actually) it might not have done good at box office or post it on this site but not listen to them buy this and i swear it will make you love it
