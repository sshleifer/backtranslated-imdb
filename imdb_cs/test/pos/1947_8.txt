I finally saw it on the video, after years of hearing about it. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is strangely hypnotic - one of those rare, special movies that make up their own world. *** SPOILERS *** First things bad. Burkewaite scenes are unbearable. Although it is a social study, this person is on top. His speeches are so overworked that they laugh. And no teachers I have ever had would have shot their students like that and told those who protest to "shut up!" These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. Next, how the hell is the end of the police coming out of the police station? And what happened to Samson's car after the first scene of his drive to the city? The rest of the film spends chaffeured around Layne or Feck. *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper steals the film effortlessly. "Look at the mail", "I love company", "you're my friend" - every line is classic. It gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. It is unbelievable that he actually makes viewers empathy for this guy, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson's) future. In contrast, Crispin Glover is sometimes hard to take. However, the scenes from his ride in Beetle are perfect - children with cars in high school always have to do and with what they do. Matt's low-key position makes Layne a good film - their friendship is believable. Glover's mannerism is a little more, but it is consistent. He controls the plot and exudes a sense of urgency that no one else will do - just try to imagine this film if Layne was just like a zombie like Matt or Samson - snoozefest! *** SPOILERS *** What makes "River Edge" worrying is that Samson isn't really bad, in the usual sense. It's a kind of boring guy who was sick of being taken for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. After killing Jamie, he begins to melt, creating some tension because we're waiting for him to see how he wraps again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the film is the way the action remains centered around teens and their views. Parents are comic relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's dad - or overwhelmed - Matt's mom. This underlines how children hang together for the attention no one else gives them. It keeps a story focused on relationships within the handle and emphasizes that Feck is the only adult they can relate to. "River's Edge" is an alienation textbook. She explains how annoying, mysterious and disturbing adolescence is like no other film.
