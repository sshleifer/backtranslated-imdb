"Journey to the Far Sun" (aka "Doppelganger") is a fun sci-fi offer from the Twilight Zone in the style of Gerry and Sylvie Anderson (team behind space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In Roy Thinnes (TV show "Invaders") and Ian Hendry's star as astronauts sent to a planet sharing the exact orbit of the Earth but on the opposite side of the Sun; previously hidden from view. The proud European space flight director (over-dead Patrick Wymark) gets a flight fast tracked and after a thorough training the astronauts set off well. Thus begins the best sequence in the movie, start, flight and landing on 'other' country. The dazzling rocket miniature work (Derek Meddings) and the elegant space flight of dreams (somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: Space Odyssey") are an easy highlight of the film. Landing on the ground "doppelganger" is exciting and scary. After this, the Twilight Zone movie aspect starts; with a conspiracy that was almost torn from the classic TZ episode "The Parallel". In addition, the film is still a solid science fiction, with some interesting 'mirror-world' chewing stuff (reverse writing and left handed handshakes, for example). Less successful are scenes depicting the soil at 21. century; where all men wear turtlenecks and Nehru jackets and all women wear mini skirts. Some relationships with women in the film are, according to today's standards, very "non-PC". And (in the most consistent failure of most sci-fi of the 20th century), computers, telephones and other hardware are big, colorful and clumsy (directly from Patrick McGoohan "Prisoner"). Nobody foresaw the age of the digital microprocessor! If one can accept these shortcomings in foresight, the film is very interesting, with the firm performance of Thinnes as a troubled astronaut. And with a nice, sixtieth and early seventies nihilistic ending! For fans of retro sci-fi (like me) it's a "Journey" worth taking!
