I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought a videotape years ago and I watch it at least once or twice a year. Grammer has a witty testimony about him that makes this film a success. His formula is definitely not original, but it is very funny. I am very surprised that they failed to get a higher ranking. It's one of my favorite comedies. It's just a fun little movie that makes you feel good. And sometimes it's just a movie.
