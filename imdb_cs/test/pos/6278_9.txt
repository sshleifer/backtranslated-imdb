1952 Hollywood decided to remake Al Jolson's first-class classic. This time Cantor's son played Danny Thomas. Returning home from the army, he is expected to follow the steps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. However, the young Mr. Golding has quite a passion for show business. At this time, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She works very well and her rendition of her favorite song Lover is remarkable. The film writers were smart not to join the obvious Jewish guy and the girlfriend's non-Jewish relationship. If anything, it's overlooked. In his anger, for betraying his promise to become a cantor, his father makes a traditional Jewish sign of loss in the family. This would not happen in the event that there was a breach of the promise, it would be the case that an inter-religious marriage would take place between the orthodox marriages. Thomas has a really good job of playing a teacher's son. His singing is up to the same level as the film ends on a positive note. I'm surprised that technical advisors didn't realize that women on Saturday or during this period were not carrying synagogue pockets.
