When I first heard that this movie was going, I was very excited to see it. The thoughts on making this movie, as good as it was, had to be very difficult. I wasn't sure if anyone could capture all the amazing features of the Pope in the film, but the film remembered its justice. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to the people who started the Pope. In his days in Poland, until the last days in the Vatican, this film was followed by every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the Pope in his adult life and beyond, did a very good job of getting emotions. Overall, this film was educational, but also very entertaining.
