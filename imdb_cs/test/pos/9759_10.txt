Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all unlikely heroes and survivors. Petite, but a strong Jean, whose strength and determination help save lives, march hundreds of kilometers and with calm self-discipline and compelling power, Joe Harman ("oh my word"), who risked Jean and other prisoners just to suffer the worst imaginable pain and Noel Strahan who believed Jean no matter what the odds. Her good humor and perseverance inspire everyone around her, and those who have the courage to go with her are rewarded. Beautiful scenery and musical score contribute to adventure. Despite the length I never get bored. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on the true story. Someone borrowed VHS a few years ago and I never saw them. I learned a lesson, buddies, and I buy another copy when you find it. It's a shame that miniseries is not on DVD.
