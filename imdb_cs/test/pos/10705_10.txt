Producer, Matt Mochary, came across a film subject, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), on a Hewlett Foundation trip to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by the story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who ended his work and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary about Sa, Rio's favelas, and violence culture. The first part of the film will show you the culture of violence in the Ravens' favors (poor neighborhoods where poor people live) through police raid records and attacks on residents. The shots are graphical and shocking. Appearing From Favelas Negativity is a charismatic Anderson Sa, who has surpassed a possible career in the drug trade to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska and other elements into a rapidly changing, percussive style music that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can't help but get carried away by the music, especially when you see that the local kids have been involved in Sao's school, which he founded in order to get rid of the drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sao's meteoric rise, and his positivity alters the many lives of children to seek life beyond the drugs. SPOILER: When the filmmakers thought they were shooting a movie, an incredible life-changing event emerged, one that must be trusted. The film then continues and you are grasped in your seat to the end. This film is the answer to the "city of God" and worthy of it. The bleak situation described in this film is hampered by a genuine example of how residents can overcome the terrible situation in which they find themselves and use their resources to constructive goals. Anderson Sa can not help you to enjoy and take root. <br /> <br /> This film is amazingly shot, changes rapidly and is immersive. Judging by the overwhelming response of viewers to last night's SilverDocs, the movie should get home distribution in the US, and a soundtrack should also be released. Watch this superlative document - it's excellent!
