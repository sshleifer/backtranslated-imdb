Martino, a young teacher on Elba Island, was created by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent teacher to be his own man and say what he thinks, something that gets him into trouble at the school where we first met him because he teaches revolutionary ideals. The island is mad because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in European history of the 19th century. Napoleon comes to his exile, not exactly the highest point in life. Surprisingly, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon, who writes his monographs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a family of merchants. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino decided his place was in Elba because he would try to murder Napoleon. Little discourages him after his mentor Fontanelli attempts to betray and condemns him to be shot by a launch team. Martino finds her solace with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. Another kind of man appears in his own interaction with the deposed emperor. Napoleon is considered to be the more human person who really enjoys Martino, distrusting the young man's plans for him. Unfortunately, Martino is unable to put his proposal into action, because Napoleon is thinking of other plans. Paolo Virzi, director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why his early promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated with a screenplay based on Ernest Ferrer's novel. The director shows that he is equally good at intimate drama and this type of spectacle. Cinematographer Alessandro Pesci has a great job with the images he could get. Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best thing in the movie. He plays against more experienced players, yet we are able to persuade us that he is an idealistic youth who is trying to get justice to what he sees is a noble thing. Big Daniel Auteuil is more subdued by Napoleon than one would expect from one's interpretation of this greater than human life. Monica Belucci is a Martino love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
