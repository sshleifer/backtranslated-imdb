I saw one of the first years I attended the festival at Sundance - they threw me away ... It went too fast and I never found it again. I thought it would appear somewhere on the compilation, but there is still no joy. Misty memory in details - I just remember that they surprise me again and again, and at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading it has some wires? Online, DVD, beat-up VHS copy - I would try to make it worth your time ... <br /> <br /> Over the years I've probably seen over 200 short films (once lived near Aspen) where they have April Incredible Shorts Fest. It certainly belongs to my favorites and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thanks to anyone who leads us, how to see it :)
