As a devoted lover of all Egyptian things, this is a classic piece from the 1950s, along with my other favorite, the land of the Pharaohs. â€œSets and colors are just amazing and everything seems so good in production quality. Victor Mature was well occupied and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole film (along with others at this time) is challenging you not to get modern movies with all of their digitized effects. <br /> <br /> Top things!
