This film is a tour de force by Julie Taymor that manages and makes stage design and masks. No one brings his imagination to the modern opera scene. Since 1992, this film has been a great success in the field of filmmaking and directing musicals. We can only hope that one day she may be convinced to return to opera. I'd like to see the circular cycle that controls it. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with too big hands as well as characters in this movie. The current butterfly in ENO uses Japanese puppetry. Perhaps by chance, or proof that Taymor's influence is ubiquitous. Taymar uses fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to re-create the story of Oedipus on stage, which is on stilts over the lake. Red ribbons are a repeating theme. When Oedipus is born, they are used as an umbilical cord, hanging from Oedip's eyes after being blinded, in a breathtaking effect they are used at a crossroads where Oedipus's killing of his father is directed by puppets. This neoclassical opera ballet by Stravinsky enjoyed justified darkness until this film brought him to life. The music is uninspired but harmless and by Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and the very young Bryn Terfel do as much of it as possible. The singers, in accordance with Stravinsky's wishes, are quite still. Min Tanaka is dancing Oedipus to Langridge's singing Oedipus. This creates some slight confusion at the end when Oedipus dances out the eyes of Oedipus. The libretto is in Latin, but don't worry if your middle Latin is a bit rusty. There is a useful narrator who presents and describes each scene in Japanese.
