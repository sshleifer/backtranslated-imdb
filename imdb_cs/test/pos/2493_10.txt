You can't watch a movie like "Privilege" by Peter Watkins, a story about using pop music by a big business, state and even organized religion without thinking about creatively degenerated commodities like Michael Jackson or Britney Spears, who hawk corporate giants like Pepsi or some another poison for money. Or any number of entertainers, in music or films who become instruments of political parties or commercial religious interests such as Scientology and Kabbalah. The Privilege movie seemed almost like science fiction when it was released in 1967, so its assumption was fantastic. Today we tend to take celebrity considerations for granted and pay little attention to their more worrying consequences. Watkins's vision has not only become reality, but we are silently accepting this reality as "normal". Now consider the Penalty Park. How Privilege invites the viewer to explore what is being sold to us and why, Park of Punishments requires us to count on what is being taken from us and why. Heaven is helping America, and in this world if contemporary politicians get to this movie. It is so close to reality that I have experienced a real feeling of vomiting and anxiety in recent observations. While some of the sharp edges of this technique were visible in Privilege, the Punishment Park was perfected into a sharp, seamless perfection. The sense of realism is enhanced by the unmistakably low, economical, believable images of the entire cast. This is a kind of Hollywood acting that has turned its back on harm in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections. The cast has first-class material to work with the Watkins scenario. Many film visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their dissatisfaction and false sense of security. No one has ever achieved this result with such hard and chilling precision as Peter Watkins does. "What now seems clear is that instead of trying to bring alienated and excluded Americans like these government to return to the national community, the government has decided to take and use the current division within country, and on the side of what it considers most, has chosen a policy of polarization instead of reconciliation policy. To paraphrase one of the characters, we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are. Better than us.
