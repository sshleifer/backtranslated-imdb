Traditionally, Royal Rumble has been one of my favorite events and I've been a fan of matches for years. Other shows may have better matches, but I've always found that the real rumble is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the winners of any match because I do not see It's fair to destroy the results of the review. Even if I speak to them. <br /> <br /> We have 4 standard matches and then a big rumble event. Two of Smackdown and two of Raw. Shawn Michaels and Edge open for Raw. This turns out to be a good match for two talented guys. This is a game I would recommend to watch. It's hard to summarize without giving away the winner. Furthermore, we have the usual Undertaker against some big ugly monster, whoever it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozun, Kamal ... this time Heidenreich. It's also a coffin match. Typical fare. Watch if you're a fan. I have to admit I am just for fun. It can hardly be considered a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two matches match. For once, Smackdown handles tostage raw. Their title match is quite exciting and enjoyable, but with anti-climax and let it end. Raw's wrestling is quite boring and boring, which is a shame because I am a fan of both guys involved. Now for the main reason I love the event, the rumble. It's pretty good this year. When we came to the event, we all had a pretty good idea of ​​who could win, and it might not be a big surprise, but hey, it's very nice. There are the usual diverse ways in which people are eliminated. There is a token guy who doesn't make it into the ring, entering, who is ridiculous and we all want to see losers, and someone gets expelled by a previously excluded warrior. He has his usual heights and lows, and I loved the end, especially the entry of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. It's not WWE in top form but its still good. Add it to your collection.
