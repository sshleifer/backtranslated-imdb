That was a pretty good movie that was pretty good overall. The idea of ​​Mercy (will not spoil) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first films. The only things I frowned on were some of the curly fighting scenes (they wouldn't even be spoiled). I like the first movie and I like this one. 7/10
