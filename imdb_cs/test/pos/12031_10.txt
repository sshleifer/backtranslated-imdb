I was a schoolboy when I first watched this movie. The next day, I knew that all the pupils of our form were watching and the film fascinated me as I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the entire Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time he appeared on TV and wanted to watch more. I think it is not appropriate to compare "Back to the Future" or other Sci-Fi movies. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you've watched it, you'll never forget it. This film is full of faith in peaceful scientific achievements, full of faith in the beautiful future of our world. It's not just a movie, but also a prognosis of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is 1984 (the year of its creation) and 2084 (where Kolya Gerasimov, a schoolboy, has been traveling for some time and where his friend Alisa Železný was from). 2005 is now, many of the inventions and achievements anticipated in the film are not yet realized. Like "Mielophone" (a device that can read the thoughts of any animal and man), an expedition to Venus and Mars (as easy as a picnic weekend), creating and launching satellites as homework for pupils, easily managing flying machines cars), biorobots, "historical identification" of any kind of material or creature performed in a few minutes, and many others. Some of them have become more realistic today than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also captures typical Russian schoolchildren (and does so naturally!). With their ingenuity, curiosity, humor, dream. Take a look at Fima Korolyov for example, you can find such a character in almost every form of every school in the Soviet Union, a similar character in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... I myself, like many of my classmates, fell in love with her at first sight! By the way, later, the actress who played Alis became a scientist - I think she was influenced by the film just like the people who watched her on TV. Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Far" ("Beautiful far-away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> < The last thing I want to say is that different divisions and "new" from the film and even the film itself came out and spread on TV and the Internet. They are not even comparable to the original. I shouldn't even comment, my comment is just about the original. So, ask for the original and enjoy it!
