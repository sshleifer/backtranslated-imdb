This series, while idealized and fictitious, has unpredictability, sultriness and good cordiality that comes from living on the island. I lived in a journey outside of Hawaii for several years and found some cheerful, unpredictable and entertaining people in some remote (non-tourist) areas. Every time I see a repetition of this series, I kindly compared my memories of the out-of-the-way experiences with the memories portrayed and fictional in Key West. <br /> <br /> This series is not a realistic TV. I hate television reality. It's from a time when people were still writing creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" who takes their inspiration from "spray angels, wizards in palm trees and elves in shells" every day.
