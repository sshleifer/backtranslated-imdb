Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's hourly orange was, of course, "no problem" that I had to see. However, I have postponed it too long because some of my friends have fired it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing has happened" "a complete waste of time". But when I saw pictures on the Internet of a mysterious black monolith, I was allowed to look into the wonderful 2001 experience: The Space Odyssey. I had no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent the movie this evening. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, watching a very good picture or picture can be amazing, but watching a movie made with the same kind of virtuosity in every picture gives it a whole new dimension. My God ... I like my friends a lot, but it's a shame I can't share with them what makes my heart jump out of excitement and make my spirit fly like a bird in the sky. The thing, my friends, is beauty. As this movie goes to show, beauty is terribly underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually shallow, fast food consumer companies. However, this does not mean that I refuse these fast-changing societies, or that I look down at them (and not even Kubrick), but only that they can be much more if only people stopped for a moment and looked a little. absorb the absolute beauty of the world we live in. And what is the better opportunity to do this, then slowing down the elegant pace of this movie and letting it take place between awakening and dreaming. When we go to this place, it is possible to get the so-called "natural high". It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty. And never in my life has this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm", as some call it "samadhi" others, more intense. Yes, it is more intense than regular orgasm ... actually more intense several times. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right. They're right? For me, a direct answer to such a question would only discourage the impenetrable fascination of the universe. In my opinion, the film attempts to convey the same secret by portraying the black monolith and by saying, "In addition to the only very strong radio emission targeting Jupiter, the four million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. The tune that Bowman is experiencing is the same thing I experience when watching those wonderful visuals. I can imagine that a secret can be frustrating for those who need quick quick answers to big ontological questions. Instead of providing us with comfort, we are constantly irritated by the consciousness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The doubts and inconveniences that result in us will point to our deeper intellectual activity, which is the source of all these problems, while in reality we have only our simple answers to blame. But this film shows us that when fast ontological statements do not produce anything but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make sense of the world. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only be truly presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself", the mysterious black monolith is no longer intrusive, frightening or irritating, but instead becomes a fascinating, charming and maybe even reassuring. We don't need an answer to what's really out there to keep in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we are able to leave mystery to what it is so that we can accept it, we can finally bring our souls to rest. I'm pretty sure that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never be overcome. Especially now that the greatest director who has ever lived is no longer with us.
