It is surprising that such production is being produced these days, especially for television. Due to strong sexual issues and an explicit loving scene, not to mention lesbianism, it is excellent workmanship and direction. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are nice. There is a fair amount of humor, but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is a truly tragic character, but not without luck. Also, this production avoids the error of most movies / shows when it comes to homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on TV and movies most shows fill up clich√©s and make characters obsessed with being gay. Not like that. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist hardly realizes what a lesbian resource is! The BBC has made some stunning productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece just confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.
