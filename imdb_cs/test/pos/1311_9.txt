I saw it originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that left a big impression on me. But recently I saw it on Irish television and there was another story by Roy Scheider ("we'll need a bigger ship!"). That ruined my movie. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes brilliance from the movies. I wonder what new version of DVD does Roy have (for legal reasons?) Wouldn't people be able to buy it. Believe me, the movie is much better for him! Cheers <br /> <br /> Damian
