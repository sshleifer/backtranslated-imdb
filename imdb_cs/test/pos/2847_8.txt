Well, well, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from a criminal drama to a goofball romantic comedy and again so fast all the time that it seemed to be two different movies that played simultaneously and then at the end they reunited. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found bloody parts (like a scalping scene) to be entertaining as well. I just fired, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. It has the ability to perform these excessive dramatic soap scenes with true facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty look like something from "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty down. The fascination of Morgan Freeman Betty was somewhat creepy because he thought he could be practically her grandfather, but the scenes where she was photographed were definitely worth laughing at! Chris Rock's performance is rather wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, a nice waitress with a brutal, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It is very unlikely that she would actually get a hospital job without any real credentials, but hey, it's a movie, just go with him! Her roommate Rosa also shines as a woman who takes care of Betty, but doesn't know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally there's Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, naturally, I thought the movie could be more fun if it was more. No one else has the same acting style as Crispin, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff on the soap opera is merry. I say I really liked the movie! If you can stomach blood, violence, and plenty of foul tongue, it's worth the watch and will give you a lot of laughter!
