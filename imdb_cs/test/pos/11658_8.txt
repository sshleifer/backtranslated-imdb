I read the book before I saw the movie, and the movie is one of the best adaptations out there. Very true and faithful book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing. Robbins is a talented film director and I would like his repetoire to add more. He made the film very haunted and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. Especially the brilliant piece of filming was a reflection of the victims who appeared in the glass of the execution room at the very end.
