Writer / director John Milius takes a slightly unknown incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a great adventure story that shows off two of its stars in remarkable roles greater than life: Sean Connery as a handy Arabian Sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, witnessing a chance to give it a "big stick" for good use. Billy Williams's immensely brilliant widescreen movie and the stunning score of always reliable Jerry Goldsmith helped. Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg. Though Milius, in view of his ability in scripts for JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, served his career, it seemed to have a downward tendency, not long after he began directing, and eventually found himself on the trots like CONAN BARBARIAN and RED DAWN. <br /> <br /> Here we hope to find a way again.
