Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir Star in "And One Was Beautiful," a 1940 film also starring Billie Burke. For one hour and 15 minutes it looks like it was B. Cummings' playboy, Ridley Crane, whom many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is more earthly of the two who like to repair cars, and Helen is a blonde bow tie with beautiful dresses. Ridley returns to town, and because he believes he won't be at the party, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a pinned dress. Ridley is there and they both join. But Ridley is in more superficiality, and when she sees Helen at the party, they both get up where they left off and go to the club. He becomes terribly drunk, and Helen first refuses to ride in his car because he does not allow her to drive. After walking for a while and breaking his heel he gets into Ridley's car as he drives. It expires and takes a bike, accidentally hits and kills a cyclist. Ridley doesn't remember anything, so Helen blames him for death. There is a female shoe heel in her car, and Katherine sees her sister buried her shoes - and moreover, something in Helena's way of realizing that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to jail, and Helen marries a man he doesn't love and goes to South America. It's an amazing movie, though it wasn't A-list cast at the time. Cummings plays a role that Robert Taylor would play (it's a MGM movie) - he's nice and very friendly, even if he doesn't have the dazzling look of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is my favorite actress, someone MGM has always borrowed because they didn't know what to do with her. Why, I wonder - a beautiful actress with a great face and voice, she has revived many films. This is no different. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and absolutely beautiful. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. So who was the beautiful one? We all know, though MGM doesn't. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended little gemstone.
