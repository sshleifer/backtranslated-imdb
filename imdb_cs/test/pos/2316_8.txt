Do you ever know you have to have it? This is the movie with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's kind of goofy in some parts, but I find myself getting to it when I'm down and just need a good laugh ... and believe me I'm not just " goofy movie "a little boy. <br /> <br /> You can read the synopsis so I don't have to bore you, just be sure if you like Kelsey Grammer, you'll probably like this movie. One more thing to be sure you're watching the final credits. You don't have to read them, just watch them and catch a performance of "In the Navy" by Village People ... and friends.
