The following is an interesting thriller that requires constant consciousness to be fully understood. The plot has many twists and uses a displaced chronology. The sequence of events follows. If you're willing to pay attention, it's an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With 70 minutes running, there's a lot to be taken, but the fast pace helps keep the viewer fascinated. Bill is a lonely, messy guy who occupies shading people and sees where they go-what they do. But he is too conspicuous, but in the end he is caught by a well-dressed, clean-cut guy named Cobb. Cobb turns Bill into a world where a poor boy is not ready to live. Cobb is a clever wanderer who seems to have full control over the other characters. At the end of the film, a discontinuous story is thoroughly explained. The film is an excellent first effort by talented Christoph Nolan, who would continue to produce Memento, one of the most original films of our time.
