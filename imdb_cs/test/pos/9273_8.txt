A refreshing conversation with the legendary Italian cameraman-producer-director who died in 1999 with nearly 200 feature-length films in his directorial position. Much is spent on D'Amato softcore sex movies including his notorious EMANUELLE records with Laura Gemser. They also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him above the water during his last decade or so. More interesting is the section on its horror and action efforts. D'Amato has a lot of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget filmmaking, including a story about an assistant who accidentally collected real bones in the middle of fake movies in a 2000-year-old catacomb. Other interviewees include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would like a little more talk about his productions of Stateside Filmirage (it's not the only question about TROLL 2, assuming it wasn't a cult movie, then it was now).
