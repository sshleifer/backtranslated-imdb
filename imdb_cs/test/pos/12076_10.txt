I originally saw it at the UK premiere. I was fascinated by this and it teared me all its duration. I stuck it from the TV to make sure, but it has been worn over the years. It seems TV never shows up. Therefore, it was a pleasure to find that True Films own copyrights and show them on their channels. This time I recorded it on DVD so I can enjoy it again and again. Lucile Fray (playing beautifully Ann - Margret) finds out she has cancer and is a terminal. Her husband has arthritis, and although he is loving, he is an alcoholic, and after leaving, he couldn't take care of his children. Therefore, they must find new homes for each of their children before they die. Acting is a top shot, the music is beautiful, and it's an experience of time that is amazing (it still makes me cry)!) If you ever get a chance, it would be stupid if you missed it. It's a wonderful movie! Must see for everyone !!!
