I have mixed emotions about this movie, especially compared to its predecessor, <br /> <br /> "The American Werewolf in London." The movie had funny moments, it was more than a horror story. This updated version, now set in Paris, does not have an "edge" at all and is simply not in the same class .... but it has good things that the first movie did not have and it is still fun to watch. So, the "Wolfhound purists" aside, most of them think that this film is pure rubbish compared to the London version, I will give him good grades because I don't care what others think. I liked it, although I agree "London" is better and I prefer this version too. The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughter, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in the restaurant. She also represents the main female character played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. It doesn't seem to be a lot of movies, or at least the ones I hear about in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the movie got points for having it in it and looks great. <br /> <br /> When horror begins, it may be scary and special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this movie, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing! However, there are a lot of sex notes and there is one scene with a guy from a bar tied to a cross who was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal, which is not suitable even for a middle-aged guy like me. This movie is much more focused on 20-somethings if it helps someone. <br /> <br /> It's fun ..... just don't expect it to live up to the first movie.
