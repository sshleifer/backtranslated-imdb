A bunch of feature films featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson and Co, were made, but the "Muppet Film" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features "The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Muppets Take Manhattan" It was released seven years before I was born, so of course I didn't get to see it at the time (I didn't even get to see his two successors when they were first released) but in my youth I saw a lot of muppet, mostly after premature death Henson in 1990. Finally, I first appeared in the mid-1990s when I heard the soundtrack. I wasn't surprised that I liked it at the time, and in recent years it wasn't quite disappointing. <br /> <br / One day, when Kermit Frog sits in a swamp with a banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. He takes his advice and goes west.He soon meets Fozzie the Bear, a failed stand-up comedian in the restaurant, and convinces him to come. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, owner of a frog foot chain restaurant that wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted with this, so he refuses and retires with Fozzie. On their way across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other muppets joining them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as everyone tries to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, with the help of Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his restaurant, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! One thing that many people praise for this film is songs, and I understand why. There is, of course, an Oscar-nominated "Rainbow Connection" in the beginning, and other good tunes to follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, "Movin 'Right Along", and "I'm Going Back There One Day", a charming ballad sung Gonzo. "Never before, never again", Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, she is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems terribly sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally nice as well as they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of humor, including Fozzie, so his first appearance in the film hopelessly tries to entertain people in the restaurant with his stand-up and, well, if you're familiar With these famous muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film may also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie Agent and Steve Martin as "Insolent Waiter". It's also not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the movie that also did well. Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching one of them because they see "Muppets from Space" (one of Muppet's films made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time in last year. I was very disappointed to see the movie that had never happened before when I watched any movie or TV show with popular puppet characters! Not only is the movie not very funny, but I think it's too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I said in my review! However, I cannot say that I think it is the same as the predecessors of this film, including this one that was released twenty years ago. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the game, and because it likes so much, not just for kids, it's understandable. I very much doubt that there is still a lot to say about The Muppet Movie, which has not been said in the past thirty years, but it's a good family pastime today.
