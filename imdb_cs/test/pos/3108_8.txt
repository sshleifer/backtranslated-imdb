Both Jackie and Candice are amazing in this movie. They are suitable for their roles and have several chances to shine. Especially the way Candice pronounces the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny because he is kind because he can also be condescending. I saw the original of this film, called "Old Acquaintance," starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They reportedly did not get, so the film is about women's friendship, which could be a problem. Here the actresses clearly admire and respect. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have accompanying parts and are excellent, especially Bochner, who has never had a lot of decent parts in the movies in me. George Cukor did not make another film after this movie, so this was good.
