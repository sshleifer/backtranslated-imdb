What do you get when you have a hard, seasoned French police inspector named Maurice Martineau to solve a murder case? Well, just a fun, fun movie. The reconstructed black and white film "Quai des Orfevres" supplies goods despite romance, jealousy and marriage, which seem to be on the road to the truth "who did it?" and intuition, the patience of this Master Inspector goes into truth - but of course with the help of a bag full of filthy police interrogation tricks. Martineau is the centerpiece of this movie. The use of director Henri-Georges Clouzot from the harsh background music to intensify the drama in the style of the big film noir is a wonderful cover of the visual experience. Martineau finally solves the mystery and arrests the culprit. Hey, he's good! But unfortunately, Martineau can also keep a dark secret in his past. Who is the boy who is not his son? Some things can never be solved - even outside the final credits.
