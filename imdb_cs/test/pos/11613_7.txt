Finally, I got to the excellent film Sazuma of this movie, which is packed with interesting accessories. I read a lot about it and unfortunately I lost it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It's not quite enough as I thought it would be, but it's still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies. I watch it a lot again than any of the last so-called horror movies vomited from Hollywood. What is humiliating to me is that some musical stimuli that sound dated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. All these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could be canceled for me and replaced by David Kristians with an excellent sound design. But that's just my opinion. Otherwise, it is a brave, angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts, such as fading a photo sequence that is beautiful. I look forward to Ascension and I applaud Mitch and Karim for their efforts to produce not mainstream film. It is a great inspiration, as I will soon go into my own short film production.
