Since 1996, first I have watched this movie, I feel that I will never reach the end of my satisfaction, I feel I want to watch more and more until now, my god do not believe it was ten years ago, and I can believe that Almost I remember every word of dialogue. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfection. I love Willem Defoe, she has a weird voice that says "black night" and I always say it many times, I never get bored. I like the music of Szararem, it's so spiritual that I got into another world deep in my heart. anyone can feel what I feel, and someone could make such a movie? I do not believe. Thanks Ondaatje thanks to Mingele.
