Beautiful family movie and beautiful movie horse. 75%% fun. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and nice characters. Horses are real beauty. He has races as a backdrop to show how lucky there is ever anything but good good sense. It shows how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. It shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. Very realistic characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something that everyone can relate to. Andrew Rubin gives a wonderful performance like Buddy, a sensible older brother. She reminded me a bit of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech, face appearance). Casey will love you for character because it's serious. Sarah Blue is also nicely portrayed by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is a character. Although there is room for improvement in the film, its a very nice, feel-good movie.
