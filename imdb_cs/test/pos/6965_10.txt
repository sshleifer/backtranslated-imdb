Sixth (and last) boxing movie. Well, it looks like I saved the last one. Ghoulies IV. I originally did it in February, but I decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is pretty amazing. I know there are some people who don't like them and that's fine. This is my favorite series. Yeah, I know the real Ghouli√© won't appear and are replaced by 2 boys in costumes, one of them is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, in the movie. Movie centers around Jonathan Graves, the main character of the first movie to be played once again, Peter Liapis, who is now a LAPD cop and gave his past the occult behind him. During the first part of the film, we meet Alexandra (Playing Very Hot Stacie Randall), who communicates with a demon called Faust, who is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red gem and something is happening and therefore releases Ghoulies from a distance. I think Jim Wynorski did a good job of directing. And Chuck Cirin's music is also fun. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this movie, the Ghoulies say Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V will be there. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies.
