In the "goofs" section of this movie, there is a comment that there is a mistake in continuity when Auguste's car is seen to be parked in a different location than was seen in the previous frame in the same scene. This is incorrect. One of the views is from Auguste's apartment, the other from Valentiné across the street. The whole goal of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who can be created for themselves - almost the Way of the Cross (as it happens several times), but never do so until the circumstances fade away at the end of the ferry. film. (And here is the effect that Joseph manipulated things so Auguste was on the ferry when he checked Valentin's ticket to see which voyage he was booked for.)
