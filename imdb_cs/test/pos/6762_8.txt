This is a novelty in Danish film. The mood is not unlike Blinkende Lygter's mood, Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new touch. One difference is fewer characters, leaving more space for them. And what characters?! Both butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is the predominant parody and Nikolai Lie Kaas is indifferent to the looser with the twin more or less unholy pairing of both.
