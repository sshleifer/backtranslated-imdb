I had a terrible day, but this movie grabbed me, and I couldn't put it to the end ... and I forgot my horrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! The budget seems to be extremely low ... but ... look what they did with it! It reminds me of the game ... basically they work with a tent, an "escape bridge", several weapons, uniforms, camping equipment, and a "scanner." This is for props. Perhaps it is even a good thing to force acting and writing to stand out and take their rightful place in the film, as a work center, instead of being after what they thought they had CGI to fight (starwars). <br /> <br /> Cgi's fine. It's not exactly "smooth" ... but it still works. why? Because there is not too much, and what is there, there is no 'takeover' of an army of home effects people trying to stuff everything they can into the shot. it evokes imagination ... it is a fairly simple thing, with a decent song (especially heavy cargo shooting .. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... which follows the entire length of the ship ... it must be a record sci fi battle sequence film do in the past 10 years, have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds), and some relationship to the story. It might look old or not 'state of the art', but it doesn't look stupid and doesn't take it from the story. Acting is good, except that the characters die too quickly to get to know them. The captain was great, but a few of his scenes could use another shot. I was also confused when his character lost his chill and stamped on the corpse, I think the captains are calm and under control ... what's going on in the scene? was the second crew worried that he had lost her at that moment? felt he was losing control? <br /> <br /> Now in terms of land .... mostly it's good ... why? Because he's not trying to explain. It happens. It's called a planet, its a mystery, isn't it? No one knows why the sculpture is, and neither will they. Mysterious cult? Strange scientist with tattoos? What do you expect in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And thank God, it's not even a Star Wars. No midichlorians, not 5 minutes of expository boring dialogue, which has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded, and they are only able to figure out a few basic things ... this is not a star trek episode where they find he's a leonardo davinci or baby like a space rogue. It's mysterious and I liked it. I don't know why, maybe I can identify with these guys because they don't know what's going on, and neither me nor ... I'm talking about a lot of space that would fool them or have magic boxes telling them what's going on. In fact, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" turns to the crew and tries to "explain" the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. has some weakest dialogue, imho, throughout the film , and this interrupts the flow and some characters look unnatural in this scene. OK, sometimes I felt it was a bit mysterious. Why, why did this guy laugh with his lightning eyes? That was strange. Just weird. The end of the "village" ... again, I would like to know that some of these characters are better. And would it be so hard to have a 30-second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show, it was a movie and we like closing in movies, although they may have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without "angels flying who sing to you" <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say. It was worth the dollar I paid for in the red box at the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better piece of narration than starwars part 1 2 or 3. As I said, it sucked me, wanted to know what was going on, and I couldn't stop watching until the end.
