A stunning film that has opened so much about disability that people are worried. It has been shown how the brain can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to see things happening to others who are being asked for the affected individual. Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and many other things have been so well captured. Two main characters played very well 2 proficient actors and invited his laughter, tears, worry, joy and dismay. I approached this film with an interest and anxiety that feared it might be too much of a sympathy game, or dwell on negatives. But it was a beautifully crafted story of two friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
