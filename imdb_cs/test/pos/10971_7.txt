That was really a pleasure to see; the dialogue was - for the most part - absolutely excellent (I thought the female roles were a little better, which is a nice surprise). The performances were also very good. Frank Gorshin is a bit exaggerated when he goes to his various disadvantages, but it can be his overcompensation for what I see as weaknesses in how a character is written; otherwise it is very good. Harry Groener does similarly well with a slightly underwritten character (Tony), slightly exaggerating some of the character's characters. Ursula Burton is excellent as Nurse Theresa, who really carries the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher have little use here, although I liked their work as always. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I can't help thinking that Grant reminded me a little of Catherine O'Hara); Cloris Leachman rather delves into his role, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a more confident hand behind the camera. Sometimes framing or staging seemed a bit off or unpleasant. The detail seemed overused (or erratically used) to me. And we're not always as smoothly as we want from scene to scene. Some of the "tough guy" approaching federal agent (music, costumes) was too over the top for me as well. And a few fantasy sequences didn't really work. But there are things that were very well done; for example, the opening procedure in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And frankly, all the scenes about Teresa's work (I suspect the writer and actress likes her very much, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are VERY good. The storyline is probably a bit exaggerated - it seems that there are too many schemes at once to keep them in order and coincidence. I have to be a little too much. It bothered me a little bit (should we really be rooted for their biggest con, still successful?) But driving on the road is very pleasant. It would be nice to see more independent movies like this. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
