Opera murders are not real murders, as are symbols of past events and parts of the broken personality Betty. In fact, Betty is the same person (man) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, just ten years later in her life (Suzy was a boy of ten who made another boy ten with a milder version of his own background). Br /> <br /> Helps to think of a luxury apartment Betty as a military barracks bay; she spends most of her time in her bedroom in her bed next to her stereo, and other parts of her apartment seem to be somehow alien to her, as if other people were living in other rooms. Dario Argento's films synchronize with a wide range of rock music as well as Funk (Dario starts her sons right at the start of his movies, a glimpse of an eye in Opera and the start of a drum in Suspiria). There are also standard movies that Opera (and Suspiria) sync. For example, Opera synchronizes with the recording album Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (as does Suspiria), and Suspiria synchronizes very well with the Kiss recording album entitled Kiss Alive II. Films like Rosemary's Baby, Exorcist, Painting and Vampire Happening are sync movies of Argento uses that deal with the same subject as Argento movies. These synchronizations, along with many others, reveal that Betty is a man who has suffered sexual torture in the hands of his father since birth (even in the womb of a certain novel by Anne Rice called Lasher). Anyway, big budget movies are occult works that transmit spy information collected by occult means, all in a synchronized symbolic / alchemical fashion. Usually, the sync point in a movie is the beginning of a sound score, or it is the first picture of a movie outside any movie company. Sometimes it is more creative. Heavy metal music used in operas and phenomena is simply musical synchronization that has been deciphered from other films that Argento synchronized with movies, a kind of intellectual game among the industry elite. So, Betty doesn't normally respond to the murders she witnesses because she has never witnessed the murder of any real person. "She herself" simply suffers the murder of the soul; testifies to his own "murder"; the individual's father almost left him in an abandoned mine shaft in Arizona at the age of 4 in 1970; he was on the verge of falling from a wooden plank his father had balanced for him before Dad changed his mind and grabbed him; the child felt nothing consciously. The memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual repression and the vague memories that remain are large, square, deep holes in the desert, and this memory is of no significance because of the lack of conscious trauma ("consciousness"). trauma loss, "also" buried property, "is portrayed in a 1975 film entitled Picture. The sausages in the Suspiria attic are every individual memory of the first three or more years of life (Toys in the attic). The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is that the individual mirrors of Christina Marsillach's character are a man who has been trained in the female role of species since birth (all DVD Simpsons cartoon sync with Suspiria) , with its very nature having been shaped along the "queen" lines (X - File Episodes synchronize with Opera). This even changed his body to be "beautiful" in the way a woman is. Behavior changes genetics. A newer movie called Death Proof deals with the same thoughts and the same individual. Practically the life of this person is reflected in the big budget films, record albums and books since 1966 and his father before 1966 and then. Scorpions album called Virgin Killer is Suspiria sync album, the original album cover acts as a symbolic mirror image of fall by skylight.
