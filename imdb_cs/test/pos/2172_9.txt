This is unfortunately unrecognized classic. The look is excellent, design, costumes, etc. They are flawless, post battle scenes and ride driving are both cool and exciting. The characters are alive and truly human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini, as a Derville lawyer, steals the film with its clever, rodent-like performance that will please the ups and downs of others. Depardieu is a good but maybe too big presence for this role. Where the film really stands out is the story and its changes from Balzac's novel. These changes are editorial in that Balzac has a lot of discussions about the company and this film breathes characters. Yet Yves Angelo has retained a key component, not just a missing man trying to regain his place in society, but every character must find his place in the company: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy a peerage, his wife (Ardent) comes from when married Colonel Chabert, achieving her position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status, and that is for good drama because their goals are contrary to others. Also it looks very modern: money is important for buying status to reach strength, but someone can go as fast as it goes up. Derville is enjoying this strategy, seeing the worst people Chabert says when he takes the case. The original place of this speech is at the end of the novel, when Balzac sums up a human comedy with great irony.
