I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. La Pianiste strengthens her diploma thesis "Austrians = grim". Isabelle Huppert won Best Actress in Cannes for her portrait of a woman who loses her humanity in her quest to achieve an artistic ideal. Captured by his talent, he suppresses his emotions and sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes rise, but soon they disappear by knowing that they cannot experience love as others can. For her it is already late and the last 30 appalling minutes of the film are undoubtedly devoid of beautiful music that bore the first 90 minutes. It seems that the report itself is not enough without the life and beauty it describes.
