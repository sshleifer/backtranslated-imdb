He caught this movie on TV and I watched it again. I thought it was a long time since I watched this movie, so why not. And this movie thrilled me again. It's so easy, so thoughtful and so human that I don't know why some people don't like it. John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every move), an angel that is hardly related to this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like a wild one, but has a big heart. On his way, Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) in her singing and searching for the right man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) is developing as a good and decent man. Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - the last scene is beautiful when dancing on the street. Travolta had great help in other actors. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and likable, William Hurt is great as usual, late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as a tabloid owner. So here we have a solid film about people with a warm story and also an attractive cast. Do not take this movie seriously and I can guarantee that you will have fun.
