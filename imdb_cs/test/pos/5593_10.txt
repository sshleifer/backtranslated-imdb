The amazing play of five stars does it and must see. <br /> <br /> Based on the play, SILVER CORD is about "maternal love" at the worst. The film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings for both sons. Irene Dunne plays a new bride (and biologist) who travels with her husband (Joel McCrea) to visit the family before going to New York for their new jobs. But something seems wrong. The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the younger son (Eric Linden) of the fianc√© (Frances Dee). However, Dunne postpones such thoughts and ignores a few strange things her mother says. He then finds out that "her" room is down in the hall of McCrea's, and his room is adjacent to her mother. Later on, he goes as a "mom" to McCrei and kisses (on the lips) good night. Mum also worked on Linden and made him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything explodes and Dee runs into the snowy night toward the frozen pond. When the boys run after her, the mummy screams out the window so the boys can come back and get their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is saved. When girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne lets her mother know what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But the mummy has a tight grip, pretending to be sick and bragging forever. The girls are leaving, but the boys are left behind ....... <br /> <br /> The crews are as beautiful as a greedy mother (repeating on the stage); it's just a few little actresses who dare to play. Sexual subtext is incredible for a 1933 film, and Crews use her best film roles. Dunne is also excellent when trying to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after he gets into a confused Linden dumping. All 5 stars are amazing in this drama, which is bizarrely underestimated and unknown.
