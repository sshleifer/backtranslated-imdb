This show is great for many reasons. Father and mother can communicate with their children this day in age. It's so great to see a real family than some stuffy overacting families. I once watched and became addicted. It's so great to see the black family on TV, which is worth seeing. The show was too early, but on the way out, she was dealing with pregnancy, sexy, drugs, bad dates, deaths, and so on. Great show for the family .. I can't tell you how many times I sat down watching this show late at night sometimes and laughing at my head. Great pg 13 rated show.I loved all these shows.
