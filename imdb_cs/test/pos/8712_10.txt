Sparkling film. BB is a miracle. It's sensual. She's a feminist. She is still very in love. The film features Paris in the 1950s. It's amazing to look at the site, cars (DS!) And Orly. Simple but very nice romantic comedy. Music is terrible. It's almost dissenting. On the other hand, it's cheerful. But it's probably the only thing that is unpleasant, at least looking at it with the eyes of the 21st century. The film comments on the French way of treating infidelity. It is the sense of modernity. The film as an un elephant made trompe enormenent did it in the 80s. But the basic assumption remains the same. <br /> <br /> We thank the creators for giving BB this opportunity.
