A touching documentary that puts the human face on the 9/11 tragedy by showing how one small community united to honor the two high school friends who were lost that day. The film combines the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. Through their memories we see two lives tragically shortened. The film also documents how, thanks to a series of coincidences, the inspirational memorial garden was thrown through the efforts of many people, known and unknown to both victims. With laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. These films evoke many different emotions, but the ultimate feeling is one of the admiration of the human spirit that is a hateful tragedy.
