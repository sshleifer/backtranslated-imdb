I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and that's one of my best times! It's a classic - interesting land, great characters, tensions and a shocking end (all built against the backdrop of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coast) will never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysteriously as his true identity unfolds. Acting is great and believable; viewers get stuck on a web that develops between a workaholic husband, a disappointed wife and an alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I was looking for a copy that I could buy for a few years - I think TV movies are unfortunately not going to be on video. Great movie, see if you can find it.
