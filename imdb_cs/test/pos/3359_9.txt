25 sitcoms had big screens. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: You are brought, Blackadder, bless this house, down, daddy's army, Father, dear Father, for the love of Ada, George and Mildred, League of Lords, love your neighbor, lover, man about the house, nearest and dearest, ignore quality Feel the width, on the buses (3), please, sir, mash, ascending moisture, steptoe and son (2), this is your funeral, until death we make us part (2), up Pomeii (3), whack -o, Whatever Happened to Probable Lady and Whoops Apocalypse. So there was a big screen from my favorite Dads Army sitcom. The film focused on when men were enrolled. It turned out to be difficult to get a uniform and get weapons. It was a great summary of the first series of dad's armies. At the end of the film, they seize several German Spies in the church. The home guard dressed as alternative servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best in the film was when they showed HG a lecture and a German lecture at the same time: German: Headquarters on the phone, CUT TO HOME GUARD GODFREY: Ms. Mainwaring on the phone, you would get 1 / 2lb Brussels Sprouts. It was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie, defeated only by the Till Death us part (1969). It would be better if it was already created at the beginning of the film, it was halfway through the war. Although it's a great movie, good for family.
