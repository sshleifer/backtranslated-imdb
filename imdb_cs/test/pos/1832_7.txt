I'll start by saying that I've always been a Bonnie Hunt fan .... He always adds life to everyone he plays and did a great job in his directorial debut. I have to admit this is a flick of a baby ... But considering that it's a wonderful story, touching many emotions and provoking all sorts of reactions. This film captures real life as people with real life-like situations. (I must rule out the coincidence that is the main part of the movie) <br /> <br /> It's a love story, not just about man and woman, but about love for family, friends and loved ones. past. (Even pets). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Well worth renting or buying.
