One day, the cat's red alley is being exploited by humans and attacked by dogs, thinking that life would be better if he were a skunk. He then paints himself with a black stripe on his back and adds a little Limburger to smell it. In his first life he couldn't be better for him, the dog flees and the butcher leaves his shop and lets the cat leave with a pile of meat. Just as he thinks everything is perfect, he was noticed by a real skunk, not just a skunk, but too fond of Pepé Le Pew. Pepé misses a poor cat for a female skunk and watches him when he thinks his protests are just shy. Our poor cat thinks he ran away when he throws skunk skin from a tall building, so Pepé thinks he's dead, initially seems to work, but when he creeps, Pepé sees him and immediately forgets the dead skunk. Finally, the cat realizes that it was better to be kicked and attacked than to be greedy for randy skunk ... there is a nice ending for the skunk when his wife finds out what's going on. This was a pretty funny performance by Pepé Le Pew, who was just too amorous at the time, but now looks like a sexually harassing stalker, even though he was eventually punished for his behavior.
