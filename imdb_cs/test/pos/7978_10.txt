This is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises - some good fun. After all, when a movie says it contains top SASS shooters, you have to imagine it's not a likely Oscar candidate "Best Picture". Those guys are shooters, not actors. Another guideline is that the film does not follow Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, which means that you should not expect to see the current hottest names. It was supposed to be just old old fun, and in this respect, every bit is as good as many old "sheep" I've seen over the years. So what do you get with it? Pay Hell? You get 100 minutes of good old fun. You get a chance to see some of the stars of the past who behave almost like what they did in their best, but a little older. You can see some good SASS shooter in the lead and a few SASS ham in the background. It was a lot of fun for me to see the people I shot with, visit them in their homes, and who are my good friends to do something that many people just dream about - they are a real, live gosh movie. They do something that many would-be actors and would-be shooters would never get a chance and I think it's worth the watch itself. It is true that not everyone is a member of SASS and so I saw a lot of fun and humor that others may miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned fun, and frankly, there are lots of movies in the theater Right now, I wouldn't give nickel to see, so save money to go see "Brokeback Mountain" to get "hell to pay" and watch some real cowboys have fun.
