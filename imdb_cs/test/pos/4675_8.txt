I enjoyed this movie. More than I expected. He has enough actions, intrigues and places to be worth it. While I can't see Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he's good enough to be a trusted manager and that's fine. Movie Superhero's Mini Cooper. It turned out to have speed, dexterity and muscle to get rid of any work. And handle a maniac like Charlize Theron.
