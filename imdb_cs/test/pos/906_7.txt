This is a short comedy Laurel & Hardy with some great and witty moments, but overall the film relies on too much comic premise. Stan Laurel wears no pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young man who comes to America in a full kilt. For some reason he gets to the center of attention because of that and his uncle played Oliver Hardy thinks because of his time to put some pants on Philip. His humor is well done, but the main assumption after a while is also a bit annoying. Although the movie still has some great comic moments, it is also far from the best of many short comedies Laurel & Hardy. The movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the biggest, though it is certainly the finest version, mostly from the majority. <br /> <br /> Great pure fun, nothing remarkable or unforgettable. 7/10
