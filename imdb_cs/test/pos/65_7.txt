I'm a passionate fan of Julie Andrews and I've been watching it for the first time on the DVD-version of Cut. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get the bedroom scene, seduction story, two stripes of funny acts, and war / shooting / blood to G rating? Strange. I would rate it PG-13. Besides, I really enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful show of Andrew's voice and talent. Acting was great. The story was a bit weak and left gaps that could be filled with good dialogue. Too much to say "without speaking, just walking" scenes ... I would like to see the relationship between Julie and Rock's flower so that intense love is more believable.
