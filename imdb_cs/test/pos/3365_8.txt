Second in the Cohen trilogy of World War II comedies (the others are: As long as it becomes part of the film and it's Adolf Hitler - my part in my downfall) is the film version of the BBC's long running situation. comedy. Like most TV shows, this film suffers from the absence of conspiracy and is more a collection of sketches. Some of them work better than others, for example the scene in which a high ranking officer floats on a river is an unforgettable, surrealistic moment. The joy of this film is its representation of a past that has never been there, and England, defined by a picturesque landscape and a chance to see veteran scenes such as John Le Mesurier, with their greatest film roles. Arthur Lowe is great as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler who, when the chips are down, shows great courage and saves the day (the peak is probably the greatest moment of the character). Of course, the TV series episodes are more fun, but as an introduction to the British legend, there's nothing better.
