Just before dawn is a horror movie. It is atmospheric, full of tension from beautiful wildlife shots, where few young people encounter fate in the form of two crazy, fat bastards who beat them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underestimated. Reached to build tensions, not with gore, but with the depiction of a menacing natural environment. Lieberman manages to build a tension in a very linear, simplistic way that is also the best way not to show gore to the viewer, but to let him imagine the worst thing that happens to the characters. Just before Dawn was always compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacres, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It's as good as Deliverance, better than Hills, I mean scarier and better processed, and it's scary like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre massacre. finally lives on DVD!
