The graph is predictable. It has been done many times in other films. In this competition, you competed in summer camps: rich children versus those who struggled to "praise" rights in typical competition camps, while kids and the console watched pranks, sex, and "good time!" Meatballs are the first (and best) summer camp movie for comedy. As others have sent, it is not a Kane citizen, but this type of film should not be. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-piece actors Bill Murray. His caravan scenes, where he tries to raise the child's confidence, are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the movie are very funny. I also like that this movie is not dirty or explicit as many other "teens in the camp" movies today. There is some mild sexual allusion and perhaps one or two cuss words in the entire film. But Meatballs is a type of teen movie that's really suitable for a younger crowd. It's rated PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you have to see several times to make all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on screen or makes one of his classic "PA Announcements", you're attracted to the movie. Bill seems to carry the film himself. But it does so well that when you see Meatballs, you'll find it a movie that made it a star! A side note to this review is to avoid all the film sequels of Meatball. They're terribly bad.
