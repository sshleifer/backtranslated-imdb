You can say that this is the director's first offer (which he also wrote), but you can also see the potential this person has. This is a low budget movie in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years later, so you can look at it as a diamond that needs a pillow. Behavior was good - if you are looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young guys who play young guys trying to be criminals. They won't be "supercool" (tm) like some veterans. I'd like to see Justin Pagela (Joe - the main character) to do more movies - he was great at it. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
