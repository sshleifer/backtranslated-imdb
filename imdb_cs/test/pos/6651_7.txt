It is an initial assumption based on the American Civil War, but it is ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, where the protagonists (Kidman & Law) seem to be aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss the day they go to war. The main draw of this film is that the law goes back to Kidman and his efforts to achieve this goal and to try to survive until he returns. The reason we can't convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before Law's character goes into battle - it's hard to believe the assumption that 2 people long for each other so little contact. Everything else is fine, Renee Zellweger and her previous father and his entourage are beautiful accessories, as is the threat of a gang of deserters. Sure, it's a long film, but it takes interest and cinema is great. An honest attempt that doesn't, but it's worth watching.
