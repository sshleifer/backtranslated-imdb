To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was dead wrong. This film is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of a city that is cursed by Uzumaki or The Spiral in English. Urban dwellers are gradually becoming dangerously and violently obsessed with something that has to do with spirals, and some people are actually beginning to turn into living things that actually have some kind of spiral, such as a snail. The film was one huge, random, sour trip twisted by romance and drama. A bit like a "twisted" drama. What makes this film disturbing is the way some people are obsessed with spiraling. For example: one of the dads has a garage full of house that holds the spiral objects incorporated into them, one girl took extremely long hair and teased the insanely huge spiral style, one child slowly turned into a human snail, one man. he could twist the body in a spiral shape, one woman trying to trim her ear to get a cochle inside, and one of them ran alone to turn around the car tire and one boy stuffed himself into a washing machine to become a spiral. Another very disturbing aspect of this very well-syndicated is the atmospheric tone and style in which this movie was taken. Camera angles complement the psychotic and twisted story, in other words very good cinematography. The overall color of this image is for a somewhat demented story. Coloring is a mixture of lime green, yellow and a little orange, and special effects with some spirals are excellent. However, like many Japanese movies, this one has a undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy. However, with all the spirals and strange happening going on in the city it's hard to keep up with the relationship of two teens. But somehow it is very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the true story of a spirally obsessed city. Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes completely different and bizarre foreign movies. It has a lot of madness and madness, it touched me.
