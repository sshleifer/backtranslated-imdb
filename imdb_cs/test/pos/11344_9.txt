SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai movies as a radio game: Invisible vibrations between characters, rooms they remain in, a rhythm that pushes them forward, attractiveness and displeasure - The whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played by a soundtrack. The dialogue is mostly completely unimportant. The narrative is similar to a childish love look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose grief is apparent but helpless. "In the mood for love" is told from a child's perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is developed by extreme light and color dramaturgy, cruel cuts, unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound. The brilliant use of Nat King Cole "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps," whose mysterious power is growing more and more repeatedly, and the melancholic waltz helps in the charming choreography of both protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dress is brilliant, perfect for a handsome, stylish Tony Leung. The audience assumes romance among them, but Wong sees a sad resignation. Both potential lovers are turning around like satellites because they know they will never share the same orbit. You want them to be found. They will not and the emotional power of their relationship, which is not sexual sex, makes the film extremely fascinating. It is a broken happiness and unspoken love. In all Wong films, they are leitmotifs. Love, whether it comes too early or it comes too late to marry the other and not the other. The desire for characters who are never satisfied, their loneliness, sadness and happiness they experience when it's too late.
