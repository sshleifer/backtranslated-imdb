I agree with the other 9 and 10 stars. I saw it at the Southwest Austin Film Festival. Of the 20 movies I saw, 7 were really good and this was the best for me. I'm crazy about movies that have devices where characters go through transformations that change their lives completely. Most of the time, excellent acting was done by people who were involved in television or their first film. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his debut as a director. Jay's work is apparently like a franchise manager for many famous movies. Forgiveness for Franklin was a sheer pleasure and extremely funny. This is one movie where I would buy a DVD and watch it again, a really high accessory from me. Good work, Jay, yes ... give up your daily work!
