I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times and consider a fine, excellent film. This version of 1971, which I bought yesterday, is a little hesitant, but now that I saw it, I'm glad I did it because it's more true in the book and in Austen's insights. The 1995 version has more dramatic power largely because it blades many characters - in the 1995 version of Lady Russell's snobbish, more manipulative, less truly looking at Anne; Sir Walter is even more vain and vapid; Elizabeth is more timid; Mary is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is more of a smile; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think the characterization in this 1971 version is closer to the book, to Austen's vision, and to the real people of that time. The 1971 version also includes more key lines and scenes from the book, including in particular the key scene in the area where Anne overhears Wentworth talking to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) About the importance of character strength. I considered acting more subtle and evocative than many critics, but acting in the 1995 version is stronger. I agree with the critics that the actress who plays Anna is too old for the part. I looked up at her IMDb record, and at the time of the shoot she was 38 when her character was 28. I thought her action was soft and effective. Wentworth is at the right age and I thought he was very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has much more of its sense of humor and teasing; 1995, a much greater sense of power a sea captain would have, and a greater passion. The 1971 Admiral lacks the grumpy presence and human warmth of the 1995 version, and lacks any sense of power the Admiral would have said; I found it as one truly weak element in production. I agree with others that the production of the "falling" scene was too wooden, and it seemed unconvinced that it would have been injured by such a small injury. However, it could be that it hit the back of the head on the edge of a stone staircase, which in fact would mean a very dangerous injury, and the scene would be more convincing than the 1995 version, where it goes, but without any sharp edges. which could cause serious head injuries. As for the costumes some have criticized, I am not an expert and I cannot answer, but I notice that none of the Navy figures (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms, while in the 1995 version they all wear their fancy uniforms. I believe that the 1971 version is accurate and always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, when officers were always in uniform when the nation was clearly at peace and the officers were separated from active duty. My father and grandfather were US Navy careers who commanded airplanes and submarines, and did not have a holiday or leisure day in their blues clothes. I doubt it was anything else 180 years ago. Uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing and I prefer it, but I doubt it is historically accurate that these officers wore uniforms so often. Finally, it is true that the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much smaller than the 1995 version, but due to the year (1971), television format and budget, we cannot blame the artist for that. Current viewers who can afford a mental contribution to lower production values ​​will find this version in their time.
