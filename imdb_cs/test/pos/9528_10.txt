I'm trying to capture this movie every time it's shown on television, which is very often. But I forgot. As it is, I practically know the screenplay with my heart, but it doesn't stop me from having a good scream, in fact, it probably adds to how I cry about knowing next time. It's such a beautiful movie - well done, well-filled, good photo. I love it. One of my top ten movies.
