Excellent special effects make this catastrophe very acceptable. It can be seen that the manufacturers have been in trouble to get the displays on the computer screens right - all very convincing. The kits are also very authentic. A good choice of music sounds pretty good from the movie. The action is good and the presence of David Suchet certainly adds the weight of the cast. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood is there with the best. Fortunately, the aspect of "human drama" was not exaggerated, as is the case with this type of film. Human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flood scenes. And of course, the film confirms what many of us suspect anyway: weather forecasts don't get that right! :)
