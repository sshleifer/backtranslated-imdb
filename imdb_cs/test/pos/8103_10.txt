"The Great Dictator" is probably one of Charlie Chaplin's most famous films. He is notorious for his reckless satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Before I watched it, I knew it was just glory. Now I know how much the film deserves. The film basically shows how the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, shortsighted and impressive dictator Tomanie, Adenoid Hynkel, is used; and with him, his close and kind staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. It also includes the use of an Amnesian, emotional and often clumsy Jewish hairdresser, a World War I veteran. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film has different qualities that have different qualities. make it unique and wonderful. While comedy is definitely verbal and grotesque and coincidental, the whole film shows how serious it takes Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with different insights. Chaplin's perfect acting skills move widely in the film, constantly rolling him up and up until he just explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious Jewish advisor and revolutionary Henry Daniell for a nasal, calm and deadly serious line of attack on the heart is an amazing sight. Furthermore, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it does not draw any punches. It's not "hidden", it has no hidden business. It's "obvious", obvious, in-your-face, obvious breaking both Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> In short, watch it. Just look at it, you'll see it.
