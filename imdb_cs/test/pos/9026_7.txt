This movie will not win any size prize. But if you have an hour and a half free and want to enjoy a little light fun, then you could do a lot worse than watching ... <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly young and pretty, the script has some really funny moments and the soundtrack is also pretty cool. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems most fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, likable and funny. I rented it because I like the 'Spooks' series, which RPJ is playing right here and there is a young and buff and perfect feast for the eyes of the girls at night. Put your wine and ice cream and laughter.
