I still can't describe what I feel when I accept it on the fancie. Such a rare film, so little spoken and known, is hard to find, even for fans, but the contrast between past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD movie, with the best possible quality. As I did in Atlantis, another rare Besson movie I bought on the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and wondered from experience. I didn't know what to expect. I've always sinister some disappointment when I saw Luc Besson's movie I've never seen before. But it never came. This film was no exception. From the beginning I realized that the one who makes such a film first is of great importance in the future. And so it happened. It has won several awards (including the highest prize at the film festival in my country, which prides me on) and shows that this film is preparing many bigger things. This can be the most original film after the war I've ever seen. There is no problem with this film: his cinematography is a genius, as is the performance of actors. I am also proud to have finally seen all the films of my favorite director and I have a copy of almost all of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting to buy a DVD). This film is most of all a style and dedication, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is the director of my choice: good taste, beautiful frame, excellent use of music (I was also amazed at Eric Serry's first score) promise of great success. Gaumont bet well on his boy-genius, a man who would later change the face of France and Europe between films and their public. Hopefully Besson will start working on a new directorial project. I'll be the first to please. In the meantime, I recommend this film to anyone who has to learn how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, with its black and white cinematography, suggests an even deeper view of the world after the Holocaust. This film works with total movie magic: it shows in pictures what we can't explain in words. And I am with all the people who have commented on this movie and liked it: a good choice! A big hug for anyone who sees it and feels that a bit of their lives have changed.
