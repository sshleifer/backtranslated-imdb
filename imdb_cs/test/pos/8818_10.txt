All in all, Big Bad John was a jolly and moving movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you are a fan of a song (like me), you almost know how it ends. But if you don't do it or not and want to watch it anyway, I recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a cheerful couple with great chemistry. However, I would not recommend this film to a strict urban people. You have to understand where these people come from and only a handful of them are left. But even a few urban people could understand and appreciate it for what it is: a good home movie that will laugh, cry and be inspired.
