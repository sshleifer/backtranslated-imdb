Again, I have to play something that is contradictory. Most of the reviews of Ab Tak Chappan were extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. And 7 out of 10 is the equivalent of a "C" letter from me. Many praise seems to be rooted in two factors: One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than a typical Bollywood movie and two that try to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in movies, so I don't have a higher score for a film that shows story and characters closer to how I believe the real world is - I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, even though I don't like realistic movies just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I do not think that "originality" versus formicism creates a better or worse film in itself. The film can be "original" and poor as well as film can be formal and excellent. What matters is how well the film does, what it does, and how pleasant or aesthetically beneficial it is to the viewer. Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mummy cop named Daya Naik. Naik was a "meeting specialist". The meeting of experts who might be said to be early instances of the real world "Judge Dredds" are trained to operate as criminals and gang members they follow, and they are basically given a license to kill - effectively acting as a policeman, judge, jury and kat in moments. Ab Tak Chappan builds on the story of Sadhu Agash (Nana Patekar), a specialist at a Naik based meeting. We see him at work, working with his colleagues to meet specialists and engage in violence. We see him at home and try to live a normal life in his less than luxurious environment. We see him trying to adapt to the new "commissioner" in the middle of the film. We see his special relationship with the notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to create a wonderful, daring film. I agree it's nice to give up typical Bollywood music numbers and novels - not every movie needs it; Ab Tak Chappan Ram Gopal Varma is known to leave behind in the background or on the road in many films he directed or produced. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances - Patekar almost releases Death Wish (1974) -era Charles Bronson vibe. He also has admirable cinematography - for example, handicrafts near the beginning of the film were particularly effective. It has great scores that mix a more whimsical Hollywood-sounding action / crime score with traditional Indian instruments and ways. Violence is well done and brave. There is also a thorough examination of subtext, including morality (s) encounters with experts, the idea of ​​subsequent commands, and so on. Meeting specialists have shown that they must to a large extent divorce from thoughts to right and wrong. All the more, the film challenges the merits of blind following orders. Parallels are drawn between meeting experts based on orders and, say, members of the country's army, and we have shown what this can lead to a corrupt situation. But (you just knew it existed "Director Shimit Amin and his screenwriters have created a story with too many characters that has grown too much and moves too slowly. All of these problems can be caused by Amin and the crew looking at the Godfather movie that Ab Tak Chappan has (at least superficial) resemblance to, albeit from a policeman's point of view. <br /> <br /> Most meeting specialists don't know very well - these are shallowly drawn characters at least, except Agash and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid) I didn't know who was up to half of the film for one, Narayan, but his name is mentioned a few times, but I would just see him until the scene changes. when it reappears, and I would have to start over when I found out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same happened with First Commissioner Agash, the film was far away from the new Commissioner before I could eat Looks like there are new characters in every scene, we never know the stories of most of them. Although it may have some artistic merit in that meeting specialists mostly kill people they know nothing about (because they usually do it on orders), because we don't know much about meeting specialists. it is difficult to find characters that need to be cared for, and that does not mean that it is a breathtaking film. The primary criminal is Zameer. But about halfway through the film, there's nothing about it. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains marching through the movie, and he's literally "phoning his performance in" - he is in another place (Dubai) to communicate only by phone for most of the movie. In fact, we don't see Zameer much. To some extent, the film depends on a couple of "twists" that require Zameer not to do a lot of things, but we could see that he does other things, and many other villains could be left out. That would make the film a little more tight, which would be more focused and about half an hour shorter, which would benefit from its impact. This is not an action-packed movie. For at least the first 45 minutes I found myself admiring the great style of Ab Tak Chappan, but he said, "Okay, deal with the story."
