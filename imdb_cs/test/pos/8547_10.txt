I've seen this movie years ago and I've never forgotten it. The topic is very topical. It was TCM this morning and I wonder why this wonderful movie isn't on VHS or DVD. I searched extensively for this movie, but I can't find it. I believe that if enough people ask for it, the film will eventually be on DVD. It amazes me that such a stunning performance of Quinn and such a powerful conspiracy is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world forces this film to see both teachers and students. This film is a great learning tool from the past, but in many ways as the current "Crash". From previous comments, I see that this film has made a deep impression on everyone. Again, it's too bad to be unavailable for sale.
