First of all - I'm a big fan of horror movies, but - I'm sick of all the goddamn horror movies. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, it's nothing wrong with blood and all that - I don't mind - but that's not what makes the movie scary! That is why I am entertaining this movie - it's fun to see a satire that makes fun of the "major US horror" concept. American splatter / gore-movies, they're not supposed to be creepy, just humorous. It's alright. But when they are supposed to be "fearsome", it's mostly pathetic. But there are some great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it's all the same. Therefore, this film came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult film - it's a classic! I can't wait for Master Director Anders Jacobsson to do another damn movie! Before I Have To Watch Evil Ed Again - And Again - And Again! But I don't care - it's a great movie!
