I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2006 and director Aku Louhimies presented his film and was on hand for questions and answers. For some reason this Frozen Land movie is in English, so I don't know how distributors got out of Paha. This is a very good movie. It's not enough for me to beat it into a great category, but I talked to some viewers who thought it was an excellent movie. Louhimies said that in Finland people either loved this film or hated it and said that many people in the theaters came out for it. I'm sure some of them have objected to some of the violence, abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, and sexual explicit scenes. It's a very clever story about how these different lives are woven together because they become an effect. This film has very interesting and powerful characters. I would rate 7.0 from a possible 10 and I would see it again and recommend with caution.
