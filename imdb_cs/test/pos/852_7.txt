I can't really criticize this movie. It is literally the first movie I've ever seen and led to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, when he saw it again a few years later, it got pretty good. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter, whose last safaris destroy mammoths. No one trusts him, including his best friend Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those who were killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has a good scenery. Acting is at a high level. I don't believe Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever turned out to be in bad performance. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The end also has an unusual twist, especially for the 1950s' sci-fi film. Definitely worth seeing.
