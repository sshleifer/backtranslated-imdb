The world will miss John Frankenheimer. That was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his other, but don't be discouraged from looking for it. Frankenheimer's direction is assured and he gets some compelling performance from his cast. Someone has already warned them, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell about two key support roles. They would both work for Frankenheimer - Gregory most strongly as a damping senator in the "Manchurian Candidate" - and do a good job for him. If the whole thing seems too simple at the end, that's just because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier have decided to tell a simple story and do it well. Watch it - Turner Classic Movies can show it again.
