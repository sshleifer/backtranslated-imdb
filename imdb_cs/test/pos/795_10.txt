Together with Cops, Goat is one of the two most beautiful Keaton shorts. Which makes him one of the best shorts ever made. It has a decent "conspiracy" to short, and it forms the perfect line to which some big gags hang. Keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict (a mistake is a classic) and then he must avoid the authorities. Best Gags - Bread Line and "Elevator".
