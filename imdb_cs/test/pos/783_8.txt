The British twist on Harold and Maude, driving lessons features a reined-in Rupert Grint and over-the-top Julie Walters. While it is true that Grint is in the first half of the film a stone-faced red-haired Benjamin Braddock, he is not discouraged from the unpredictable family film - things that happen from his experiences that would create a shocked response. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, although Laura Linney's hard work making her written stereotype of human is also notable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make these kids popcorn on Saturday afternoon.
