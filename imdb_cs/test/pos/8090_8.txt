That was Charlie Chaplin's first movie. Yes, there was a bit of sound and speaking in his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still a silent movie. It wasn't until 1940 when the public heard Chaplin talk about the film. The film is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I was enjoying the movie, I wasn't nearly overwhelmed by the fact that Chaplin's other feature films from the mid-twenties and thirties. This is because I really felt pissed off by some of Chaplin's dopes who overcame when playing Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he was lecturing. The stupid pseudo-dialogue looked like something a smaller comedian would use (eg Three Stoogs). Plus, playing funny Hitler is hard for me. But when Chaplin was playing a Jewish barber, he wasn't particularly witty (in fact he wasn't meant to be a funny character), but it was a huge voice of reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially because it doesn't really stand out), but for its outstanding acting and humanity. The final speech of the barber (impersonation of Hynek) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the movie for this reason alone.
