This film came into production before the start of World War II but was not released until it was in full swing. With a significant fascist compassion in the US and Chaplin himself, a suspect as a communist sympathizer, the great dictator was a very brave effort. Such risks in filmmaking - seldom veiled political statements - would be almost incomprehensible today. Imagine if today someone did the same satirical film that criticized US foreign policy? This film is jolly, engaging and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin begged for madness to end, but it's too late - for him and for us. They must see if you are interested in history, filmmaking, politics or sattire as an art form.
