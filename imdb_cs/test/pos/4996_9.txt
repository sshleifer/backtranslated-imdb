What this film hurts is everyone, and their Aunt Matilda compares it to his predecessor, who always hurts every show. If you take it as a Western, it's a brave good show. We'll find out how our characters in 'Lonesome Dove' ended up in situations they start in (for example: Why do two Texas Rangers who live on an adventure end up in a dead city? Of their life?) The performances are very good and we see exactly the same manner the characters will be on their way. The actors did a very good job. Cinematography was excellent and the music did not survive in the legendary score of nearly two decades of the last century, which was an impossible task, and that was still fine. It also helped us to have three episodes you can't see in the miniseries. Hell, it's absolutely impossible to see a two-piece phone these days. Western fans, rejoice!
