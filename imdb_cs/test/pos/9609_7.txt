Peter O'Toole is a delight to watch the roles in which the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance to get drunk. Pretty Susannah York provides a good movie for the dramatic presence of O'Toole. . Although this is not a major movie by any counting, it will be remembered for its fun show. Even York, who signs papers at the end, is a good experience that looks and quietly radiates tragedy. A possible weakness is Thompson's deferred direction. But the movie floats because of the actors and the script. I've seen the film twice for 20 years - on both occasions called "Brotherly Love". "Country Dance" is a somewhat farcical and awkward title for this film, wherever it was released as such.
