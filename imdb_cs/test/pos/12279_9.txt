In the late 1960s, director Sergio Corbucci produced four Western spaghetti in a row - the classics MERCENARY, BIG SILENCE, SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Three of them, with the exception of SPECIALISTs, are constantly appearing on the top ten lists when western spaghetti are rated. Until recently, all I saw was a very bad compilation with English, some Italian, fuzzy picture and it was almost incomprehensible. Now that I've seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages), I can safely include SPECIALISTs in this group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as a charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with a gun returning to Blackstone to explore the death of his brother, who was lynched by city dwellers for losing their savings. It is the sensual beauty of the bank, the leader of the Mexican bandit, El Diablo, who was once a friend of Hud, an honorable sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small band of hippies - well, it was in the late sixties, and the hippies were everywhere , even in our westerns. It is not a desert western, somewhere shot in the Alps and is a beautiful sight. There's a little more nudity than I expect in the West, but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is beautiful as Sheba, who can be Hud's niece, or the girlfriend of a dead brother ... it has never been clear. This film deserves to be seen, and again, please ask a nice DVD with all the trimmings - I think SPECIALISTs would be as well known as others from Corbucci's other Westerns, and that is a big praise.
