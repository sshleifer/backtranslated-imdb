ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (from four) Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, director of "One Night at McCool's" a dark comedy about the strength of women over men and how a group of people can perceive different facts. It's the same story told from three different angles, and every time we tell a story, we try to reveal a little more about what actually happened, which no one knows. "One Night at McCool's" is a feature-length debut by director Zwart, a director who earned a commercial and music video that began making short films when he was eight years old. We've seen so many examples of how these guys think they are creating another commercial or music video for television with their productions, and Zwart rejects this tendency, and he captures a specific humorous truth at "One Night at McCool's , "From the inventive, complex scenario of late Stan Seidel, even if it is often somewhat confused. <br /> <br />" One Night at McCool's "contains three men who share their own experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In this respect, this movie is a comic version of "American Beauty," but in others it is a separate world. <br /> <br /> "It all started one night at McCool's "explains each of the three men to their different listeners. There's Randy (Matt Dillon), a menu at a local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser) who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the salon becomes a crime scene of a dead friend of a woman mortally named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her when an individual treats her heartlessly. She stands behind her and before they can say SEX, they have strong sex and she moves with him. At first Randy is reluctant: "Sex and violence, all in one night? Is it a little too much." But who could change a gem like a gem away. Jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, he pulls him out of the hole of grief because his wife died. For Carl, he makes him forget his loving family and a nice little suburban home. For Randy, she lights up a few fires, both positive and negative, later persuading him to contact bingo to play a human hit named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to end her misleading ways. Interesting is how the film perceives three different chronicles - even the jewelry costumes are related to the person who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, fascinating gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and a lot of neckline. Randy is not sure what to do about her, waking up to his otherwise dull journey that would not go anywhere. The most interesting feature of this film is the jewel itself, which is always played by the amazing Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in a man, but what they can offer her. Her motives are too simple, not true evil or evil; she is just a young lady who, at an early age, learned that she could get out of her life what she wanted from her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of fun with your material. From the enthusiastic entertaining cast to his forcibly showdown, "One Night at McCool's" uses most of his humorous ideas. What makes the movie even more fun is how the three opinions of men differ. The actors also have a lot of fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously moody; Reiser throws his eccentric, squirmy part pretty well; Douglas is crafty and mysterious in one of the most entertaining performances of the film; Dillon gives his personality an arrogant personality, even though Randy is a blank one; Liv Tyler is brilliant. She injects Jewel with a perfect amount of boasting charisma and irritating joke. It reminds us of the intimate performance of Suvari Currency in "American Beauty". "One Night at McCool's" is the first film that comes from Michael Douglas's new production company, Furthur Films. It's a creative, real and sexy production. On the way, we often get into a convoluted structure, but this is a natural response to a film that deliberately intersects several angles to one story. The film ends with a note that is both black and comic. This is another of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; black comedy. Many films of this genre meet either as too black or too absurd. "One Night at McCool's" is one of the few that really works. <br /> <br />
