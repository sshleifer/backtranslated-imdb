I was surprised that "Once More, My Darling" did not generate enough votes (in this writing) for "user rating". It is a "comedic" comedy that I have enjoyed many times over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission is to place him in very unlikely situations and it is him. He maintains his trademark "confused" view throughout the film and hysterically as well. Ann Blyth plays his premature / eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist. Her character is magical enough to guarantee an unnoticed nickname "Killer", but she stays cute and cuddly. is a standout. This one is worth looking for.
