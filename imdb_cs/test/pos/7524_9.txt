This short, formative cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pew, concerns a cat who thinks he will solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. The problem is that it attracts the most unwelcome attention of the sincere and for the real skunk (our hero, Pepe, entering the left), which is definitely more attentive, let's say than M. Cat wished. Every big plan has its drawbacks, but this is cork! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from Hays Office that Pepe and the subject of his adoration were both men. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the existence of the production order. The subsequent "conquest" was clearly and definitely a woman. A very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works better than a focal point. It's worth watching. Recommended.
