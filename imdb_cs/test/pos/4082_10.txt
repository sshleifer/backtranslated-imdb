I recorded The Morrison Murders on the Lifetime Movie Network and watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker got his brother Luke to admit he murdered his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching true life stories, a lifetime film network, and Courttv. Morrison killers is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is a lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I'll watch Morrrison killers again because my favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders ten because it's a good movie about Walker trying to figure out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and at the end Walker discovered that he was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and brother Bobby.
