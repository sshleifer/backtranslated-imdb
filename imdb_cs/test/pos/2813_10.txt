When I saw a preview of this film, I came to myself, "here's another stupid TV movie that is written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves she can actually act if she gave a chance) as a woman who falls in love and marries a man (now and again is Eric Close) but begins to lose confidence in him when a series of rape series begins. to act in her community. At first he is blinded by his assurance that he is innocent and his love for him, but as time goes by, he is still suspicious. Although it sounds like a setting for another boring melodramatic TV-movie, it's really much better than that because the characters are well-behaved by Thiessen and Close, and the movie script allows them to be much more complex and smarter than you would expect; These are not just cartoons or cardboard figures that exist just to move the plot alongside real, three-dimensional people, and we really care for them. And the film is so clever that it is able to provide an exciting story, including the peak, without resorting to stupid action scenes, thoughtless clichés, or cheap melodrama. Instead, we are involved in the main characters' inner disputes and concerns, and we get a realistic view of how they might be able to solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you can see it, please. Production values ​​aren't exactly top (after all, it's a TV movie), but if you can look around you, there's a great story.
