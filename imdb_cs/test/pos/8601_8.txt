Until the final credits that this film produced in 1989, it was clear that all the elements of his production were made to look in the sixties - acting, characterization, sets, and props had an aesthetic from the past. The film opens to the moments that preceded the fall of the A bomb on Hiroshima and how this tragic event affects one family: the young woman Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white, and using special effects that are quite primitive in modern standards but emotional and effective, imaging of the immediate consequences of a bomb is quite terrible. Family members do not recognize each other, others resemble zombies as they wander through the streets in shock and shock. The title refers to collisions that fell shortly after a bomb that was mixed with radioactive ash, and in which Yasuko caught. Rumors of Yasuk's being in Hiroshima at the time of bombing affect her marriage prospects and later learn that black rain is actually causing illness. The film is not just about the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but also the social and psychological damage that has been caused. <br /> <br /> I found the film a compassionate and fascinating journey into a unique culture. Although the film is primarily focused on the pain that one family feels, the subtle political message of the film is important today and probably for all times - wars have terrible consequences and should not be closed unless absolutely necessary. It is said that history is repeated, and the current leaders of the "coalition of the willing" have learned nothing. While the atomic war has not appeared since 1945, it has other deadly consequences. This film is a convincing view.
