I love this movie! He has it all! Bonnie Hunt has done a fantastic job of co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. Combine all these talents with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belushi who have a good Oscar movie! I'm surprised they didn't get him. If you haven't seen it, borrow a DVD, watch the directors comment once ... Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!
