I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to John Waters films because I was too young to watch them. And if you know about John Waters being limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or other family friendly movies, then you have to prepare for the Pink Flamingos. Explicit sexual acts, incest, old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and unhygienic acts with chickens are just a part of some corruption in this movie. The film ends with Divine, Waters' 300 lbs. Cross-dressing Star Eating Dog Excrement. Assumption is about two families: one pair of inbred trailer baskets that includes Divine and Edith Massey as an egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families compete for the title "Filthiest Man Alive." Enjoy John Waters' best movie, but you only see it if you're a man with a strong stomach because some of the scenes in this movie will make you rough.
