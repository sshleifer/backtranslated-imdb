I was surprised and amazed to find that this film was released in 1940 before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as serious and terrible as Nazi Germany could be misunderstood as a rash. But Chaplin's brilliance is not limited to a joke of all. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not be nearly as valid, if not for the excellent use of humor in this film, along with the moments of the sharp drama he squeezed into. film. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (a Jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. In the final speech of the Jewish barber, I forgot for a moment that the war he had spoken of had been over a century ago. These are words that are now meaningful and in every time of war. For this reason, I think the film was much better than the damage because it has the same deep effect today.
