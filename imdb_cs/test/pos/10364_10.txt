In his work with a single nationwide nonprofit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. devoted exclusively to the issue of high school crime prevention and student awareness I see too often the type of campus violence and "cover-up" through the secret campus courts portrayed in the movie "Silence of Mary". In fact, we receive a series of calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters, such as Mary, who face similar situations. His depiction of the rape of the campus and the subsequent crusade of "Marie" roommate victim and student journalist, who Melissa Joan Hart played very well, because justice was very well done and well researched. It was the first TV movie I have ever seen that I felt truly reflected and included all the various complex issues related to how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with at our universities and universities . Although it would not be possible to solve all these issues in depth in 2 hours, this film comes closer than the others I have seen.
