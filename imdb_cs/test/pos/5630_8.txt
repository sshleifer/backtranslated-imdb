I'm proud to say I'm a student at UW-Milwaukee where parts of the movie were filmed. Yeah, I met Mitchell Hall, where I graduated from a film class, maybe the same class as Smith. There I learned about the "American film". Our professor told us shortly before his release. Sure, I was impressed, but for some reason I put it down for a few months (it must have been pretty good if it was still playing, at least in Milwaukee). When I finally noticed it, I thought it was a fun documentary. It's not a masterpiece - it goes a little too long - but I inspire Mark's passion and determination. I hope this movie signals the beginnings of bigger and better things. Perhaps his upcoming "Northwestern" will propel him to wealth. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (outside ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Released by Sony Pictures Classics
