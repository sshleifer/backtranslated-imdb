Yesterday I captured this movie on television. I was curious about being directed by Emilio Estevez and playing with him and his real dad, Martin Sheen. I like to see a film about a father-son relationship that includes a real father and son. It is natural that there is immediate chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense because they know they are actually connected with them. Of course, it helps both of them to be amazing actors. I saw Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think it's Emilia's most intense role - it's mostly that I remembered him from the Mighty Ducks series - and I was impressed. Talent really runs in this family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance. She pulled my heart with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - a beautiful actress from the movies "Father of the Bride" - is also very good and holds her in a group of talented veterans. The film is a bit weird with dialogue, which is of course focused on the stage, but I didn't mind. This is not meant as an action film; this is a character study. And for a movie that is based on play, it's never too claustrophobic. When Emilia's character, Jeremy, remembers his days in Vietnam, we see that his appalling memories are revived. The film is extremely strong and realistic without being sentimental. Finally, I expected that all conflicts would be resolved and the family would become hunky-dory, but that was not the case. The end made me cry without resorting to the standard Hollywood melodrama. This proves that reality is much more attractive than anything Hollywood can conjure up. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with extraordinarily amazing performances that knock your socks off ... please look at this underrated gem. Hopefully one day Martin and Emilio will team up with Charlie and all together will make a great movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (of 10)
