The short film that Gaspar Noe got on the film map introduced us to his horrible but intriguingly interesting character The Butcher, which was played by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's direction here has all the characteristics of his later films, which show that he has carved his own voice and style from the beginning. His sudden cut, along with harsh, loud noise, flashback skipping, and many other techniques are used to distract the viewer. And it certainly works. They are also not afraid to show violence as the Irreversible viewers will know. Here the violence is equally strong and almost unbearable in Seul Contre Tous's sequel. The movie opens with horse killing. He's shot in the head, and we're watching him clinging to the floor of the blood. Then we see human birth in all his bloody glory, the butcher's daughter. He was an orphan in WWII, and grew up hating the world, and everyone and everything in it. He serves his customers, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts - he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who would also bring her role six years later, is the only thing she cares about, and we watch them age together. But she is mute and is subject to bullying and agitation. The butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing when she's old enough to do it herself, but that's more explored in the next movie. When attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage and stabs into the mouth of an innocent man. He goes to jail, taken from the only thing he wants - his business and his daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see everything and more, his time in jail and release back to his world. Given the condition of his daughter, autistic, I think he is insignificant, he does little, except staring, and is under the full control of his father. The film continues in the exceptionally bleak Seul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two movies, this one first. He has some really excellent acting performances, but due to the tireless tone it is very difficult to watch them. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
