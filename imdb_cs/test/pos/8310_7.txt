The main criticism of the COUNTRY CORE is that it is cheap, special effects are bad and so on and so on. Yes, some of the special effects are badly painful, but what many people overlook is that it's actually quite fun, which is very important in my book. Just look at STAR WARS movies: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are capable of creating stunning visuals as far as human imagination can imagine, yet with all the dazzling flashes these movies were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, Fun is not! In other words, who cares if the FX is not the greatest when the movie spirit is fast, funny and clearly set on the action side. I Love Everything About CORE COUNTRY CARTE: The Contrast Between Victorian England Stods VS Wild Other-Secular, Pellucidar Color Environment, Character Cast, Lost Underground World Concept, Telepathic Pterodactyls, Human Rebel Slaves, Jubal Ugly (lol!), Inspired by Peter Cushing Team is great!) and Doug McClure, excellent music (it's really good), cinematography of amazing Alan Hume and last but not least Caroline Munro. There's sexy sex in this movie. One of the most sexy B-movie girls ever caught on the screen. Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what's fun. Gimme AT CART COUNTRY over every STAR WARS turgid prequels anytime! At least Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx can recreate.
