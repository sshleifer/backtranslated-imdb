Output (1977) Larisa Shepitko is a name he knows very little. Her director's clear career lasted only a decade, and a tragic car accident suddenly ended. Despite her short career, however, she managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her time. Her latest film, The Ascent, is widely regarded as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. However, her work remained in the dark for all those years that followed, usually only available on rare and poor copies on the video. This has changed thanks to the people at Criterion. They have released two best works by Shepitka through their Eclipse - Wings department and its penultimate masterpiece Output. During the darkest days of World War II in snow-covered rural Russia, two guerrillas weave through the land in search of food after their party is attacked by Nazi patrols. Originally they only went to a nearby farm, but when they arrive, the Germans will find it. They do not want to return to empty hands and continue to enemy territory. On the way, she must face not only enemy soldiers, but also the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, potential betrayal and her own souls. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a simplified graphics device or destination. It solves difficult questions with painful rationality. He never takes an easy path or gives us reassuring answers. The other half of the film is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between the Russians - those who collaborated and those who fought. While she shows coworkers as clear heels, she also shows why many have turned to such tactics - survival. The film contains a number of religious references, especially to the crucifixion. This is the spiritual path, into the hearts, souls, and minds of the two parties and those they encounter. Shepitko and her cameraman capture the path in a beautiful black and white photo. The camera moves in long shots, just like the camera of the second-largest Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky style, and Ascent took some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's childhood. It's a stunning movie you can watch and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and frightening atmosphere of occupied Russia. Shepitka's husband would pay tribute to her big movie for decades. Elem Klimov made his own war masterpiece with one of the biggest movies I've ever seen - Come and see. The story and the themes of this film were clearly influenced by the output. Although that film is also quite obscure, it has received far more attention than any Shepitko movies. But what worked as a bridge to Shepith and was one of the best helps keep her job alive. Ascent is a truly spectacular movie and should be considered one of the best films of the 1970s. It's stunning cinema; his mood is eerily authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. That is, in some definition of a word, nothing less than a masterpiece. How unfortunate that Shepith's career was shortened just as it hit the top.
