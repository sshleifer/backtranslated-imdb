A great story that the film producer was telling. Interactions between a man and a leopard have brought many questions to the audience about who is human. People killed animals for no reason to survive. At the end of the movie you were wondering who the real "hero" of the movie was. Well told story. The human actor did a great job, but the leopard stole every scene he was in.
