Abel Davos (Lino Ventura), head of career crime and crime, has been on the run for more than 10 years and hides in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his home country of France for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy and the police closing on him, he decides to return to his old land in Paris. Abel and his other commander Raymond Naldi sent their wife Therese and two young sons to Nice. Heistka goes through a modest half a million francs, which is less than their sources suggested, despite the fact that they and the police are chasing both to Nice, where they are hiding briefly. After stealing a cruise ship from the local, they strive to get to San Remo's tourist destination, where they will mix faster, but are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach, followed by filming and Therese and Naldi. both were killed. Now wounded Davos with two children in tow will be easily spotted by the police, inviting his old friends in Paris to send help, but since their old friend got into hiding, they aren't very inclined. they risk themselves, so they send little time thieves, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo), to save him. Davos is disgusted that such a humble thief is sent to his aid, despite the fact that he immediately intervenes with the charming Stark, sets out to find out why he was stolen, but their betrayal is not over. Classe Tous Risques (aka Big Risk) wrote on the screen a former death prisoner and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura already on board the project, Giovanniwanted Ventura proposed a director's assistant , who took his attention to the previous project, to one Claude Sautet, who was most famous at the time, when he helped Georges Franju with Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately agreed and the rest, as they say, is history. Sautet has created a subtle gangster movie that plays strongly on characters and relationships. Davos keeps hiding, has plenty of time to think about his life, past, present and future, about his friendships that he doesn't believe is his, now deceased wife, and what happens to his two young sons. As an actor in the role, Ventura has always impressed me as comfortable and convincing in both the police and the criminal fraternity, here is his world-class performance of noble and powerful as his world falls apart like loneliness and loneliness of a man running kicks inside Ventura is a former profession as a professional wrestler gets a lot of use when throwing parisien hoodlums around with perfect ease. Belmondo as Stark revives another story within the movie, that of his budding relationship with the girl he meets on a trip. With his straightforward charm, his purity that it's just "Voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" when hitting his aggressor, it's also a pleasure to see how she falls anyway. Belmondo's performance was overlooked at that time because Godard's Bout de Souffl√© was released just three weeks before, Godard was honored for discovering a new guy on the block, his versatility in these two movies when he was there to see and admire. Sautet's film is a classy affair, with the use of a lot of attractive places, the film also has a very sparse dialogue, Sautet prefers to let the actor do the work with the most beautiful views or looks sufficient for the next story, the needles say that Noir's fan will in the future will control more of Sautet's work.
