About 12 minutes to the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr first walk around, is a really nice song ... what is that song ?! And who does it sing? It's a song that sounds very romantic and is a singer, playing the piano, etc. I've been trying to find music all over the world on Google and on iTunes, etc., But it's just not coming, not even on Lyrics So, if you hear it, I would certainly like to know enough about it to try to go to a CD with that song, or find it in iTunes. I don't know if my email will be pulblish, I'm new to this ... but I'll look back.
