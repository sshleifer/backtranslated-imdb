We still really love the movie and the soundtrack "Valley Girl". I have owned it on video for several years and I wore an original soundtrack. I have a few friends I meet, and we have a "Rave" of the 80s - a party where we meet and play 80's music and "Valley Girl" runs on the big screen - and we're all in our 30s. We have amazing time. <br /> <br /> It's all in good fun, like, you know?
