A great episode, it showed that Dean not only had good taste by choosing Cassie for her girlfriend, but also shows that she has a heart and can only love one woman and is not just a person who loves and leaves! Aweso e episode. Applause is in this. I just hope to get back to Cassie's relationship next season (if it's next season?) I'd like to see her return to her "supernatural" lives, especially Dean. I also like the fact that she chose an African-American woman who would be a special lady in his life that had somehow gone. I hope they don't screw it in and stop when the episdoe is over. The girl who played Cassie was really looking and it was good to see WB breaking into what we all see in everyday life - an interacial that has become common and acceptable (finally!)
