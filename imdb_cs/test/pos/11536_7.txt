Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a movie that, based on some comments from contributors to this forum, sounds a bad problem, but in fact it's much better than being led to believe. This is the story of two sisters who have loved each other. Faith, a fair and happy hippie girl, takes her younger sibling Phoebe under her wing. Apparently Phoebe loves faith; when the elders decide to follow his friend Wolf to Europe for a summer vacation from Berkley, he promises to send Phoebe a postcard every day. Faith does so until the cards stop coming and one night a little later, the family receives a phone call to inform them that the faith has died in tragic circumstances. Phoebe can't forget the faith. That is why after several years she went on the same path as the older sister took. Taking cards from Faith and visiting every place, starting in Amsterdam, then going to Paris and ending a trip to Portugal, where Faith met her premature death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe talks to Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf tries to convince Phoebe to leave her path and return home; he suspects that Wolf is holding the key to solving the mystery, and when he is about to fly to Portugal, he discovers when he finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version of Phoebe. She feels guilty and decides to go along with her girlfriend's wish to accompany Phoebe to the city where Faith died. The story is changing at this point and we are going back to the backstage of what faith in Europe has experienced and what has happened in its last days. The best thing about "The Invisible Circus" is the introduction of directors, something Mr. Brooks has to take over. A big surprise is the Cameron Diaz series, which, like Faith, selects portions of light comedies when she is able to do good drama work under the right director. Jordana Brewster is perceived as an older Phoebe and makes a great contribution to the film. It's a stunning beauty with what seems to be the nature of acting. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also able to do a more serious drama. Sweet Camilla Belle plays convincingly younger Phoebe. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of girls. European places are beautifully photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also enhanced by the musical composition of Nick Laird-Clowes and the original song by Peter Haden. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape because it gives the right tone to adapt the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast does wonders for him.
