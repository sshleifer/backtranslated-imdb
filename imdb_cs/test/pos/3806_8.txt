This movie can be best if you like watching movies and laughs and then subjecting your friends to watch these movies too. If you're like me, and you're probably, you'll be laughing for years to come up with jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks from a guy with kids and then that boy takes those kids to the woods like Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go home with them. The kitchen scene with soup is full of comic genius clowns: "Inspection Officer - here!" and the lines that follow will probably remain in my mind forever. When I showed this movie to my friends, they usually say "What was that?" so if you are in the mood for one of those movie types, yippee! This movie is so OOP is no longer funny, so probably the easiest way to get it would be an online auction. I first saw it from a rental company.
