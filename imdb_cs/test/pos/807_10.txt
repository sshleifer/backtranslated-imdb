Excellent work all around, especially the actress who played the wife of Gerd (Claire Price) as well as David Suchet. I really found whodunit, but it is next to the point. The end that I will not reveal (someone describes it on the board in response to someone else's question if you are interested.) I found really sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard figures, I thought it was very well rounded and big. The story's stimulation was good, and I liked to see Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I believes in being well-known Dr. Watson.) as her husband.
