This movie is the best movie I've ever seen. It's also the best seen movie that uses drama to tell history without speculation like JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. This skillfully depicts the buckles that Belgium had on the Congo. It is also easy for us to tease the European and American forces that were behind the power that Congo today is today. The film certainly included the US, rightly, in Lumumba's murder. This film could never be created in the US because American film is rarely criticized in actions of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) This also allows us in the problems that were present with the internal conflict of Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how uncertain the country sits in setting up new governments when their history is colonization, and those who were colonizers continue to pull strings of strength and power. The film is well shot with Eriq Ebouaney's excellent Lumumba. The cast is great and really pulls you into the climate of Congo at the time. Again, it's worth seeing those who love drama with the right historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
