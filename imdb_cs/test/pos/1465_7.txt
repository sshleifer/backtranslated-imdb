Soap is an interesting film and very brilliant. You have to look at its strong characteristics and the risks that conspiracy of two problematic individuals in love. You need to know the story through various other reviews, so you can talk about what's brilliant about this movie. First, two protagonists are so real and so interesting people. The first is a woman who has chosen a four-year relationship and is upset to sleep with anyone who goes. The other is a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the former and your heart is bleeding for others. The second thing about this movie is the whole concept loving for everyone who is, regardless of gender. Would you love your partner if he changed his sex? The film explores this idea and it's beautiful. But there is one point where the movie fails. I wish the relations between the protagonists would develop better. That what he feels is love does not come to an end. But watch it and send your thoughts on it .......
