I usually have a hard time watching a TV movie, the extra long business breaks break my concentration and give up and find a good book. But this made me join in and stay with him to the end. I realize that the film was based on a true story, but it wasn't given why it took so long to find Denny? They had his name and I would assume his social security number. While moving a lot, it would seem that he would be found as soon as his number was entered for work, etc. It was only a technical defect and did not take the file. For LifeTime Movie it was better than most.
