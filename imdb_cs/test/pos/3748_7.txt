Is it a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective film, thrilling, scary and then, surprisingly, actually moving when the "old man" meets his unfortunate death at the end of the film. Yes, what lurks in the maze becomes something of a surprise, and for many people it is cheerful. However, the basic idea (ontogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis) was very real at the time the book was written and actually has a basis. Not that it obviously results in what we see in the movie, of course. But working on what had to be a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers - and the person for whom the term "designer" was invented - creates a very frightening mood that was strangely convincing. Sometimes, of course, the film is very stupid, but it has its moments.
