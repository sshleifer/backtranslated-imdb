Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it took longer. He seems to have already died. Many critics have tried to shut them down. I do not know why. It is the most interesting movement that takes place in the film world from the French New Wave. In addition to Fuckland, I saw the first three in Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. In my opinion, they were all great, Festen was a masterpiece. Fuckland is not for the others. I was fascinated by filmmaking. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to refuse it. It is clear in several places in the film that it is a work of complete fiction, but the illusion was a great time. I wish the creators came up with something more interesting. It's basically about the guy, Fabian, who is an Argentine guest of the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were only allowed to the islands in the last few months, and Fabian plans to impregnate women with Argentine children. He looks at one, and most of the film is spent on her seduction. Both actors are very natural. Camilla Heany just hints that she's an actress. Fabian Stratas seems completely real. The film's policy is somewhat confusing to me because I have only a clue about the island's situation and its recent history. I think I had 3 when Faulklands were attacked. The last piece of the movie doesn't work at all. I don't understand what the filmmakers were doing there. But Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. However, it will break some Dogma rules, especially the rule that has no diagetic music. There's plenty. 7/10.
