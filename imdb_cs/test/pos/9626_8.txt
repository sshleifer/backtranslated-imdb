I saw five fingers on Drive-In ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I had ever seen, and I was very entertaining. I recently bought it on a DVD and watched it again. I was also fun for the second time. I believe this is probably one of the most Kung-Fu movies modeled on. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. They even threw karate and judo into Japanese style (very bad boys). I remember being amused by the dubbing dialogue, "Hey you! and "They shouldn't escape with this! I'll have to go to this bad crowd!" This time it wasn't so distracting, I think I'm used to it. If you have the slightest recognition of this genre, it's the one you should see.
