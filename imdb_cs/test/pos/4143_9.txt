I was fortunate enough to be in this movie when I had about 13 during the roller slide scenes. My junior high school drama class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud have been playing live music all day long! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication that these guys put into their role. They had to play these songs 20 times. Under these conditions, it is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy. This is visible during editing on the close-up of "It will be a day," but fortunately, the unsuspecting public would probably not raise it. Skating all day long, getting a day off from school and getting back in time was incredible excitement. I also had the first "date" on the movie. I had to go to the box office for the girl. Woo hoo! Even with outdated hair and hot lights that melted petrolatum in my hair, it was worth it. Fun stuff. The film is top-notch and very satisfying as a whole. Busey adds his best role at all and the support cast is excellent. I'm glad I took part in the great movie of the day. I think I could be in the Corvette Summer or something. No. The funny ironic ending of this is that years later I was in a video store in Malibu looking at a movie a week when it was released on video. Gary Busey walked in and stood next to me. I showed him the cover and babbled how great he was and how I was extra and what didn't. Quite strange, but very cool, for what it's worth.
