I saw Mara Ardentra and I felt I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any field and can unfortunately sometimes distort the true value of the film. Many people rushed for an excellent cast and it's beautiful shots / camera-work. Javier Bardem is certainly an actor who brings something extra to every movie he does. Saying that it involves a real Sampredo is a little stupid because I don't think any of the reviewers would personally know Sampredo. Deceiving and using a certain spell is an acting skill that, although well done, does not represent 'perfect' performance. Bardem does just what he does well ... and that's it. Working with the camera is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film does not have. Sampredo is shown here as a man who bends to the dying so much that he leaves his loving family and marries a woman he seeks only when another does not help him in his search for dignified death. Now I'm not to say anything about or against euthanasia. The problem is that when you comment on movies like this, you can barely escape. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss the film in this powerful subject. I consider it a weakness of the film - unintentionally - depicting Sampredo as unsympathetic. Someone who is much smarter than his family, as depicted in a simple cousin who "won't" get a double-layered poem directed against him. Someone who leaves a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is undignified. A scene that is built alongside a female lawyer who, according to the film, makes a "bad" choice that ended in a remote dementia, suggesting that Sampredo was correct. The woman who is constantly looking for him is almost overlooked for a beautiful lawyer, but suddenly he married Sampred when she agreed to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into the calculated number no matter how charming Bardem portrayed him. Argumentative I would say that he would not be quite convinced, and I think Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element to his film. It is still a formidable film for a young director and certainly has strong moments (such as a discussion between a priest and Sampred). Camera-work is impressive and the movie is fine. But 10 out of 10 ... no film reaches this perfection.
