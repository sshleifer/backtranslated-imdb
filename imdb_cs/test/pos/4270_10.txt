As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than just tell a story. Good films, like good literature, make people think, think and predict. This movie made me all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses anticipation, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choice of characters in the film, their choices do not seem to be adolescent or criminal like other movies I've seen. Acting is pretty good and actors seem to share good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you can't hear on the radio. It is a reconciliation with life / a spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than a second glance.
