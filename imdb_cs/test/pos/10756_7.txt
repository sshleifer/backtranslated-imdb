It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work resulted in his last great silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After he enters sound movies (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel and Hardy and WC Fields) and does better than Keaton \ t but not like the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as a producer (but in his films he went five years ago). Laurel & Hardy was under the protection of Hal Roach, so the production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good. Fields first worked with Mack Sennett than Paramount, and then free. Lloyd tried the route that Chaplin took, but with less success. He produced his own movies, but unlike Chaplin, he didn't own his own studio. Also his first two elections were not good (especially "Feet First"). But he started to choose wisely and "Movie Crazy", "The Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and possibly "Harold Diddlebock Sin") were his best sound businesses. Everyone is entertaining, but none of them are up to "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four best "The Cat's Paw" sound movies, it's the most controversial. The solution of Ezekiel Cobb to get rid of the city that elects him mayor is extreme for the 2005 taste. Or is it? When the movie is made dictates what it is politics: "Cat's Paw" has been since 1934. That second year of the Roosevelt New Deal (itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement) movie audience saw movies like "Gabriel over the White House" and "Phantom President" "where our leaders have done extra-constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies (and force disarmament around the world)." Even Cecil B. De Mille got into this law with "This Day and Age," where a bunch of teenagers used rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes. For us, using violence to force anyone (even a lot of goons and boodlers like Alan Dinehart's gang) to admit he's repulsive. After all, the Supreme Court has protected us from confession under duress. We are forgetting that the reforms we think did not occur until they were introduced by the Warren Court and Burger's Court. For example, although Mr. Justice Sutherland's view in Powell ("Scottsboro Boys") case of 1932 guaranteed every accused criminal had the right to counsel, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend this to order the trial paid advice to defendants until 1962. \ t a well-known warning against self-accusation, it dates back to 1963. In 1934 nothing like this was considered necessary. If you study other films from 1954 (and even 1960) tricks are used to confess - Kirk Douglas confesses his crimes against witnesses in "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster holds a gun to him . When Lancaster leaves, Douglas grins as he confesses under duress just to see that the weapon is unloaded. Suddenly he realizes that he (legally - in 1948) admitted without coercion. Hate saying it, to some civil libertarians reading this note, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his mates in the conclusion of "Paw Paw" was not only legal, but would to their prison sentences in 1934. fascist or horrible, but it would be legal if it was invented.
