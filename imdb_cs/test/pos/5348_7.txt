'' Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of Were-Rabbit '' is the same type of animation and from the same creators '' Chicken Run '', but the story is different now: Wallace, the inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog Gromit, who always helps Wallace In his problems, he tries to keep rabbits away from all vegetables because he is in their town, the annual Giant Vegetable Competition. But when Wallace attempts an invention he has done to avoid rabbits, he who is cursed is him. Before watching this movie, I did not know that these two characters already existed and were famous. I loved Gromita and I think he's one of the best dogs I've ever seen. aka "Wallace & Gromit -A Batalha dos Vegetais" - Brazil
