It's where Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope is. He recalls the NY city mind set period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, a lift of his own firecracker and finally retreating to the bed of his adoptive parents. Absolutely absurd, his life seen through magic goggles sees things that "really are" ... I don't think it ever shows up again. If so, sure someone would Tivo the thing and put it there. Kidnapping melts: mixed in the rain, seconds in or out, or in stores, our hero throws a raincoat on the prey and throws it into his ice cream car, which takes her to his basement apartment in the village. She is overwhelmed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when she wraps out of them: instead of a seductive lady, she captures a suburban home that talks and talks and talks. The film is full of medallions of commuter life, suburban life, city officials, and all the attitudes that are so dearly held. It pushes the boundaries of comedy like magic reality could push drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to draw on an imaginative scene to demonstrate his situation or desires, all at the very edge of credibility. It's all funny, no one's in mind.
