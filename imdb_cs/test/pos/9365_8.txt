A brilliant thriller that deserves much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are amazing in their lead roles as well as the whole support. A truly stunning film noir representing beautiful images and a great dialogue, in the heart of everything, is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on the novel about homophobia, this film challenges post-war antisignism and all intolerance and hatred with considerable force. Although parts may seem a bit modern to modern viewers, they still have the power to shock and function very well as a thriller. Credit to all involved.
