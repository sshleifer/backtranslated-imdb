I went to this movie and waited for the slasher, and while Mute Witness affects the style of making the movie, it's more than just an average swing. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Wait Until Dark, Cat o'Nine Tails, to name a handful), but the consequences of having a diminished will in thrillers like this are well illustrated, and actually an integral part of the conspiracy, because the fact that a leading character cannot speak is often the reason why he finds himself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else. Our silent witness is Billy Hughes, a make-up artist working on horror production at a studio in Moscow. She finds herself closed after an hour of one night, and after trying to phone her sister for help, she encounters what initially seems to be doing illegal sex swing, but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what she has seen, but she finds her story nobody believes ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the Hostel has made headlines for displaying snuff movies in a foreign country, but this movie did it and in actually does a better job. Maybe it's not as ugly as Eli Roth's opus, but gore is more effective, and because director Anthony Waller (who continued to direct one of my favorite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humor in the book, Mute Witness is pretty gorzy and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for thrilling excitement rides as he never stops. The storyline is put into action quickly, and Waller constantly introduces a plot of twists that give a big helping hand to the overall fun value of the movie. Acting is not bad for B-movie, with young artists Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards delivering good performances. The atmosphere is brave and the Russian sites are conveniently hostile, helping the film maintain its premonition atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better film than one would expect. The plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are in place.
