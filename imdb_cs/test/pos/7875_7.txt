Imagine the "Dragnet" episode where Friday and Gannon go to a typical 1970s day of hippie inequality, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, "get some." That's "Joe" in a nutshell. This film of a fanatical worker and a rich guy who just killed his girlfriend's girlfriend has been terribly dated, and most support games are buried, but it's still interesting to watch. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (bigot) and looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays a daughter with a doy-eyed, and although she doesn't necessarily indicate her future size, you can't tear her off.
