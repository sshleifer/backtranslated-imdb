When I was very young, my mother had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies shorts on the tape and I watched them several times. One of these shorts was Coy Decoy and I was really shocked to read in another comment that he was banned. When I was young, I probably didn't even realize it would be. It is still probably why it was forbidden even when I watched it on the video, nor did I remember the gag. When I saw the video, I remembered some shots - especially the shrinkage of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes, which became a clockwork when the bait surrounded him at The Lake. I wasn't bothered by a gag that was most likely the reason Gag was banned. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories as I watched this short time. Given how much I like this short as a child, I rate it 7 out of 10.
