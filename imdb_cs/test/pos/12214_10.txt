I do not believe that sixty percent of voters voted for this show as ten, as the hell rating five points eight impossible I do not, its totally pathetic I think how. the show is great, the story is great and the characters are interesting, certainly ten out of ten I think the creatures are great, they look great and I wish the great show had a great cgi hope the second series was a lot unanswered in first season and when nimrod gets bigger because the other creatures are huge, so why is the rating so low when the voices are so high <br /> <br /> 10/10
