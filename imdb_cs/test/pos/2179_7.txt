Well, I just saw Buster Keaton's film debut in The Butcher Boy's Fatcher Arbuckle's, and despite the rough way it seems to have happened almost without reason - I found a lot of laughter. Just as Buster orders a butcher boy's molasses, Fatty, Buster returns to pay, Buster says he put it in a bucket that has molasses, Fatty dumps in Buster's hat, and takes money, Buster takes his hat back on his head, gets Stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to the floor, Buster's legs are now stuck on the floor and so on. It probably didn't sound funny, but it was cheerful on the screen, as well as some other slapstick comics including flour that was thrown, and a later sequence that takes place in the boarding school of Fatty's girlfriend with Fatty dressed in drag and Buster helping Fatty in battle. As I said, many scenes make no sense, but visuals, especially those related to Arbuckle and Keaton, are still laughing today. Recommended browsing for Keaton.
