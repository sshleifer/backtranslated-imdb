Reportedly, he has returned with 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead' with the same cast and setting, but Laura Gemser certainly does not. I really liked this movie. Sure enough story and dialogue are codswallop, but it is so beautifully shot in such a wonderful setting and I actually like hardcore. I find it suddenly naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't mean she's a black girl and some limp penises! I consider the numerous and varied sex scenes to be very believable, even though the two are built on a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves alternating. Creation is not offended to appear up to half an hour before the end, and is to be said to be disappointing. However, in the remaining time he manages to kill all but two expeditions and in the case of girls who have sex with them first (or at least in one case!), And this film is not as slow as some keep. In addition, there are some gentle moments of sexploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two 'natives', and the famous finale when two survivors speed in their ship, look back at the island they escaped from and find there is still time to one last act of copulation.
