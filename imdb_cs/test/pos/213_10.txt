Two years after the success of 'Airplane', Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring Leslie Nielsen as a plain-dressed detective 'Frank Drebin'. Also in the cast was Alan North as 'Captain Ed Hocken', Ed Williams as 'Ted Olsen' and William Duell as 'Johnny Shoe Shine Boy'. "Police Unit!" featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would end up with a fake frozen frame in which the figures in the frame stand completely calm. One of the best freeze frame sequences saw one of the figures pouring coffee into a cup while standing still, causing the cup to overflow! Visiting stars were killed in the introductory titles, one included Georg Stanford Brown to be crushed by falling safety! Despite receiving positive reviews and many critical feedbacks, 'Squad!' It only took six episodes before they were canceled. But that was not the end, five years later the show was brought to the big screen for the first in the "Naked Gun" trilogy.
