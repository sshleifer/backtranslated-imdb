He loved today's show !!! It was a variety and not just cooking (which would also be great). Very encouraging and captivating, the viewer always looks around the corner to see what's going on. She is as down as on earth and she is as personal as you are, like one of us who made her more fun. Special guests who are friends also well prepared for a nice surprise. He loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play too. I have to admit that I was shocked to see how she came under some of her time limits, but she did, and I would write those recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with your family. Those who are not yet tuned to find out what channel and time I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
