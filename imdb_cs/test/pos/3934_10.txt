I'm not sure why this film is on average so low on IMDb when it's all you ever wanted in a horror movie. This is the definition of horror film. I consider myself a great horror fan and I have to say that this house supplies goods. Wax House It is a story of a group of college kids on their way to a football match who decide to go out for the night and run with their local father. After waking up the second morning, they make a horrible discovery and decide to go to the city for a broken car. The city is scary and I stop there. Because it is when really terrible chaos begins. Believe me when I say that if you are looking for a horror movie you will see that you will love it. It's amazingly diabolical and inventive, it's a killing scene, the story is interesting and the characters are politely drawn with actors who give them gobblers. Paris Hilton included who is doing quite well. The film lies a bit on the shallow side, but it's so fun and who cares. This movie should be eaten by the box office and all horror fans should be involved. Look at the House of Wax Film, which contains skin peeled, super glued lips, dead bodies of dead animals, hot wax sprayed on still living person, finger cut off, decapitation, pole over head and much more. I was fortunate to have witnessed this film at the premiere of Tribeca and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. And the boys have something to be proud of The House of Waxes is the scariest roller skating of the year! 9/10
