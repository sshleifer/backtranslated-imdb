mondovino is a moving and rewarding document. in the world of wine there is a huge difference between large wineries and small wineries. It's not just about the size of your vineyard, but also the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to place advertisements in a wine viewer and hire a so-called "wine besides", then it does not matter the size of your property. also in the business world today, wine often has to sell massively and suit people's tastes. what it means means that many times the wine filters its origin. mondovino shows the business side of wine in the mega producer Robert Mondavi and Michael Rolland, a wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today's critics like Robert Parker, who is also in the film. now these men are not evil or bad because they have done much good for wine. but they have power on a large scale. as we all know, the power of corruption. Mondovino also shows small winemakers such as Aime Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille from Volnay in Burgundy. these winemakers aren't hungry winemakers, but they know like all the great winemakers where the grapes are. the best example of this is not explained by the wine producer, but by the Haitian man working for Neal rosenthal importer of wine. Terroir is cultivated in the grape field, and it matters that the guide hand that knows it is an important real wine.
