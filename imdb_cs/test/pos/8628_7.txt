For us, Abbott and Costello is something you have to be in the mood for. I am very happy to see it - my wife remembered it when she was young, but I never saw it. The family wanted to watch something that wasn't too serious before bedtime and it was chosen. Our daughter has been watching many old movies with us - she has always complained at the beginning, but most often met them. At first she mostly ignored it, rather checking her e-mail, but she started to enjoy herself - many times laughing aloud. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think you can have an evening out with 55yr old. A monochrome introduction that mixes with a full color fairy tale. It's a fun story to tell everyone, including a little song and a little dance, along with everything you and Lou and I expect to deliver. Watch it with your kids a very fun evening!
