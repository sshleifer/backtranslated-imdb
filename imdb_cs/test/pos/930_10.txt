France, a model in France, is separated from its lover abroad, they are planning to meet in England, but it seems to be growing more and more with the progress of the film. One night, after giving up her coworker's card, she hit a dog named Rita. The dog will survive and return it to its owner, listening to the hostile judge who lives as a hermit and eavesdropping, listening to the conversations of all his neighbors. She becomes interested in the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his tapping games. One conversation they both listen to is of immense importance, but a conversation between the young, who will soon be a judge, and his wife, which we will find parallels with the life of the person eavesdropping on them. As we learn more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then continues his story, and see if the two men will continue toward the same fate. Few know how her life, this encounter, and the fate of the young judge are involved. Her dog beating that day seemed to be a fate, a divine sacrifice on the part of the dog for her owner, allowing Valentine to be the savior of a young judge who travels the same way as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a grim future full of loneliness and loneliness. The old man's dream seems to be fulfilled after all, and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> AMAZING the finals to maybe the best ever trilogy! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favorite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colors of the French flag in three films was nothing less than incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. And his subtle connection between the three movies is amazing. Typically, they are marked with a slight pause or late focus in the scene to see if you can identify any of them. I have to mention this and it's a huge SPOILER, I loved the end as all the characters from the three films were the remaining ferry disaster survivors, along with Valentine and the young judge, and the old man watched it on her. The TV, consolidating his happiness over the suffering he has been dealing with for many years. I couldn't imagine a better way to end the movie, but a smile on my face, a great way to wrap up an amazing movie and trilogy! I recommend it to anyone who loves film, movies, anything ... Artwork! 10 out of 10 for film and trilogy.
