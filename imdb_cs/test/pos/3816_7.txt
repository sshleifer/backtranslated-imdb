This film caught my attention so much that I watched it several times. The plot has holes, but the main artists make it work. Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does a great job as a 37 year old woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked for years to make money for a medical school. He performs brilliantly in his residence and is just about to take the test aboard and make his dream come true. Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered, and as the closest living relative, she is forced to marry her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid becoming a state church. Amanda has about 7 years of her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her parent that she is muted. Needless to say, Julia is 16-hour days with longer care for Amanda. Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the life of Julia and Amanda. He's always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her anxiety. Amanda really starts to warm Kevin as the film progresses, maybe more than her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take a lot of care of Amanda when she tries to handle the case and prepare for her examination. Kevin is there whenever a crisis for Julia breaks out. The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You are constantly watching them meet before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to express quite a bit without words. Upon conspiracy, Julia and Amanda gradually warmed up. You can see how they work on the relationship as the film progresses. We found that Julie and sister-in-law (Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable microchip prototype from their employer. They had three companions who intended to share the theft. Julia discovers that Meyers is planning to jump over the country under anticipated identity. The storyline is unclear whether Meyers intended to double their companions or was itself double crossed. In any case, Meyers is murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers do not try to remove the microchip from the Meyers before they kill them. Killers are looking for a home and can't find their price. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the rest of the film doing clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julie and Amanda who have no idea where this price is. Eventually, the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes of knowing something about the location of the microchip. Finally, Julia reveals the truth about Kevin. He's an investigator who hired a stolen microchip. After a few harsh moments in the relationship, they manage to save Amanda and send bad guys. The predictable ending has three to form a family and moving happily into the future together. <br /> <br /> There were big holes in the plot. Kevin returns to the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after Meyers' murder. How does he know that the microchip is not yet in the hands of the murderers? The killer kills fingerprints at the murder scene without being interested in concealing their identity. The killer, who pretends to be a psychiatrist, is revealed to Amanda by remnants of red paint from a murderous scene on her shoes. At the beginning of the film he didn't show up on the murder scene. There are other weaknesses along these lines too much to mention. The film could be much better if the script was refined more than filming. Filling the fence openings would cost little and greatly improve your effort.
