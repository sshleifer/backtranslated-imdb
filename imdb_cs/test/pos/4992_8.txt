Things I love. Steve Zahn, as a Gus, nail part, copies Robert Duvalls's mannerisms that makes him feel good about Gus fans. (some other actors copy their ancestors style also in this series). Karl Urban, looks grim and hard, but can crush a joke and smile, which T.L.Jones did in the original series. Outfit, weapons, clothing, all accurate, or very close to a period of precision. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in the Open Range. Comanches, they are actually riding bareback rather than hiding the modern saddle under the Navajo blanket. And they are not painted as politically correct peace loving shepherds, but as proud fighters. There are some stupid scenes, but it beats the hell out of yet another variation on something stupid to win a million dollar reality game shows.
