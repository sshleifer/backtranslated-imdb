We haven't seen this movie for a while, we've caught it long ago in a nicely transferred Criterion DVD. "Le cercle rouge" is a film that owes much to other films, as it reminds us of "Rififi", "asphalt jungle", among others because they all deal with capers that take the central scene in the film and reproduce in detail . Unfortunately, one knows that the old saying that crime does not apply, and from the beginning these men who are involved in it are doomed from the beginning. Jean-Pierre Melville was the director of several words. He did not fill his pictures with many dialogues, as in this case. Nevertheless, for not being "talky", they had the style of their own as proven with "Le Dolous", "Le Samurai", and his masterpiece, "Bob le flambeur", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style that appeared in everything he did. In this film, in cooperation with cameraman Henri Deca, he takes us on a journey through the streets of Paris, which shows a vibrant city mainly at night and a bleak winter in France. The score is Eric Demarsan, who emphasizes jazz music that accompanies most of the action. Although the film shows Alain Delon, as Corey, in the center of the action, he is a clever inspector, Mattei, who is the true hero of the film. As Big Bourvil played, he is a man who shows a lot of patience, because from the outset he figured out how to catch Vogel, and in the process he participates in the investigation of jewels in which he knows the man he has escaped. behind him are large states. Bourvil gives an extremely satisfying performance because Mattei shows the same parts of determination and tenderness as the three cats he adores. Alain Delon has always responded with interesting appearances to perform in Mellville's paintings. Here's Corey, a man who is first seen leaving prison and promising not to return, but he can't take care of a good thing when he decides to go ahead and take part in a robbery. His relationship with Vogel and Jansen pays off in the way they get their job, but it also turns out to be a mistake in the way they won't be able to destroy prey because the fence they relied on has a change of heart. Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are considered Vogel and Jansen. They were excellent actors who mix well in the action of the film. The two actors were in their best moments when they took on the role and showed. Mr. Montand has a more complex character as we witness him at his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons in his head. Jean-Pierre Mellville got amazing results from his cast and crew in the movie, though it feels a little longer, but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable paintings by the director.
