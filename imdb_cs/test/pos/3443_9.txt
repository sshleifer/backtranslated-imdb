I definitely agree with my previous commentator that I describe it as a captivating, fascinating and certainly beautiful movie. There is no need to see all the episodes because the first ones are the best, while the last ones are a bit tiring, but for all those who like German and their good-natured ways, it's worth seeing all the episodes. Values ​​are constantly being questioned, even though the murderous past is confronted in recent episodes, rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended to all who are going to live or travel in Germany, preferably in their original language !! <br /> <br />
