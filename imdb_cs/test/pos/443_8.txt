I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and I always enjoyed it. This Can-Can is an authentic blast of joie de vivre, such as Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, but French. And Jean Renoir a nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is also a chronicle of the show of this age, full of affection and French mood. It is a too clear tribute to Impressionism (people who like impressionist painters will like this painting). It is primarily a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, Father Jean Renoir, Pierre-Auguste. Here you will find trusted and wonderful colorful recreation by some Renoir masters. Excellent casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Although it tells us about the creation of the Moulin Rouge in Paris, it is probably a fictional story (and by the way it is not very original because it falls into the well-known morality that the show must continue). But Jean Renoir's production is great. <br /> <br />
