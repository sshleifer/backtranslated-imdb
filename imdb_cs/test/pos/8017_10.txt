Okay, so I like Aidan Quinn, even with a bad script. This is not an assignment case. As other viewers said, it was a movie I hit on a cable and got into it, I didn't want it to end. Take one Cuban US Navy Ofc. (Quinn), who is a righteous, hardy soldier and family man. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the most famous terrorists in the world and add Ben Kingsley and you have a "Task". Sutherland witnesses the most famous terrorist actions of Carlos in a coffee shop on a beautiful day when the evil is so deeply shaken in this man that his only reason to live is to get this man as long as he breathes. Take one soldier to a pass in Israel that is a dead bell for this man and is defeated and held by Kingsley until they realize they have a plan. By taking Carlos by being his or by being responsible for never helping him get rid of his world, it is a very difficult task and guilt. By not helping his country, he is bound as a man and his military duty to wisely. So the training begins. Let's say Carlos is there with the Academy of Arts and the Holocaust. When I say that this intense and beautifully cast, screened and executed film speed is the best, I'm not underestimated. All three actors could save almost any scenario. I'm not in terrorism or movies, but I'm addicted! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who for once plays a heavy one that could endure every actor including Gary Oldman. That's a compliment. Rent it and get lots of popcorn. Did I mention sex? It works better than "The Last Tango!" And his educational.
