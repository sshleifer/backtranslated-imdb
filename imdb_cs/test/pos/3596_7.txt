I didn't read the book. I don't even care. The movie was a beautiful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. No, it wasn't a "10" movie, but it was nice. women, if your man is bored, how mine, then look at it yourself. Pain is amazing as a philosophical doctor who adds a thoughtful monologue to "in love" and "loving". Also, if you like a nick cage, it was amazing and fun. I enjoyed watching romance. Also, if you like a Christian package, you see it in balance. this is a "10" sci fi movie. <br /> <br /> See this movie. ignore previous user comments. <br /> <br /> one - especially ladies !!
