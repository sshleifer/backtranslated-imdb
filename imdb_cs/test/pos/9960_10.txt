Some thoughts before I get to the heart of the movie: 1) I've never seen so many bare breasts in a movie before, depicted in so many non-sexual scenes - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, Where Have You Been? You charmed us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in love *, and then you left for a while. Mainstream American wants more! Okay, I'm an English professor, I've read this game many times and this is probably the best movie version I've ever seen. Although the different aspects of other productions have become distinctive, it is an overall package that has been created well. Pacino is not Olivier, but it doesn't have to be, so get over it! Film cinematography is overwhelming and not just for bare breasts. Venice is portrayed amazingly and you feel that they really are there. Portia's residential island is amazingly beautiful and lighting is always tinted in the right way for the mood of the scenes. Antisemetism in this movie / game is hard to follow, especially at the end. Pacin's knee fall and pinching his religious artifact is perhaps the strongest moment of his film from * The Godfather of Part III * (when Michael's daughter is shot on opera stairs). Is the game antisemetic? Sure. Is * Othello * a racist? Sure. Take what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era, not a comment to date. Women in the film are fine; nobody really got out here, but mingled with the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in two roles juiciest, opponents to the end. I always felt that Irons was underestimated (I still get chills when I hear his voice from the Lion King) and Pacino is Pacino.
