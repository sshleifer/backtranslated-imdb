Yes, I know this film is intended as a comedy! And humor is up! But the subject of making people less intelligent in the future may not be so attractive! I cannot say that this will happen, but if we do not care properly about our education system, it can be an option! I noticed that some schools didn't teach the facts anymore! (Like history, geography, basic things). The emphasis is more on learning practical skills! Most subjects can be boring, but it is essential to understand how things work! In the film, this ridiculous example of people cultivating crops with Gatorade instead of water! We can laugh about it! But if you have never taught that water contains the minerals necessary for plant growth as you would know! For me, it's a scary idea! So now you understand why this item is no longer funny! It could be that Mike Judge makes fun, but at the same time warns people for a real catastrophe if education doesn't improve fast! I take this movie too seriously! Yes of course! Everyone from his own fun! I loved Mike Judge's job (Beavis and Butthead and Office Space)! In them, he was both critical and entertaining! I missed it in "Idiocation"! Most of the events are too absurd and, as I said earlier, very scary! I think if you are in the mood, you will enjoy this movie!
