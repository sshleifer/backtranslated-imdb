In this episode Locke and Eco are looking for "?" the symbol we saw when locking the previous episode. Michael, who shot Ana Lucia and Libby, fights his actions like Libby's thumbs closer to death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). It's during a commercial break. Locke and Eko find the hatch under the plane that killed Boone in season one, and a new educational video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In the following commercial break, somewhat bizarre and nereescript commercial ads "The Hanso Foundation" the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) guides the visitor through the world of life information on the outside of the LOST story. Must see all the fans!
