I thought one dark night was great! He deserves 10! As for the statement made by one user, the dead were really zombies in this movie. A dead man brought to life is a zombie, regardless of the way or reason he returned to life. "Zombies" in this movie are used to scare the girls, not to feed them like traditional zombies. This film is a clear star among the horror movements of the 1980s. Scores and atmosphere are quite scary, and the audience is held in tension across the mausoleum scenes. Acting is actually convincing, with a real expression of horror when looking at the undead. While I like all the zombie flicks, this movie is a refreshing change from a typical "meat-eating zombie" movie.
