This is one of those films that are very underestimated. Again, I vote for an underrated film. This movie has a good story, maybe a bit far, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) shows us good performance again. The guy does a great job in acting, but he never gets credit for his roles. He is doing well from the goonies. Not only him, but Louis Gosset JR. doing work. I thought this movie would make more money in the theaters, but he would still care for money. All around it is a good movie that will keep you on the edge of your place from time to time and the plot will move the movie itself. I have enjoyed this film and hopefully the rest of you will also be.
