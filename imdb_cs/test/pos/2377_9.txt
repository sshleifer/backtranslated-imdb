OK, this is not compared to the explosive tempo of the first sequence opening sequence; nor its visual shock value; nor in this respect the melancholy tension of the second installment. No, it's surprising and refreshing (except, of course, from the two main actors). The futuristic face language scenario drives characters together across genres and languages ​​with almost gravitational force. The moment of impact is your choice: a) Shakespeare's metaphor of life and humanity in cartoon costumes; b) sublimation of violence into homoerotics; c) humorous detonations of impossible accumulation. Everything until then is even less clear. We highly recommend non-discriminating film enthusiasts who don't mind foie gras with hot dogs; more cautious towards those who have a more refined taste.
