I saw the movie again, I believe for the sixth time. No doubt I'll see it many times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to writer and director Gilles Mimouni. He hasn't made another film for ten years and this was his only one. The story and performance of this sophisticated film are perfect, and it is clearly pay tribute to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton all the time. The timing of the split game is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of the house falls on Keaton's 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and he is not just killed by the thumbs. In this film, people are bending and turning and passing each other unnoticed, and if they were one second away, they would collide. The story goes so much to random events that you can't take your eyes off the screen for milliseconds, or you miss something essential. Creepy, though deliberately repetitive, Peter Chase's music reminds Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole film has the same frightening quality, but while Hitchcock had one woman, two women, Mimouni has two women, one woman, turning the plot structure over. There are pass links to other Hitchcock movies, but this is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration for this movie. The subject may seem superficial to be an obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday casual events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, untold. Everything is excessively charged with passionate love and desire, but desire transcends its object and fights against something behind and behind the object. That's why he's so easily portable from Lisa to Alice when he finds out he's Alice, who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it's Alice, who embodies eternal mystery. The film is finally created by Roman Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she overshadows Monica Bellucci, which is really something to break away when we consider that Bellucci is a discarded beauty, while Bohringer is what the English call "plain". However, Romane Bohringer had more than mastered the art of "personality dominance" in this early age, when beautiful girls fall down on the track and ignore them because Romane is so fascinating that you can't take your eyes off your long enough to look at beautiful girls, and you finally think of her. Most of us are sure that her father, Richard Bohringer, is in the bath and listens to the opera in Diva many years ago. I would rather look at Romeo than Richard, who is lying in the tub, but some genetic secrets seem to be fascinating because Richard Bohringer is also charming and not even a woman. Romane looks like she can change to Anna Magnani when she's much older, and that means she'll get an Oscar if someone can just write another "Tattoo Rose" for her. The girl has so much passion in her that she can light the Seine. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Julie Delpy got in touch? This film has made great use of Parisian sites. But where is this "square in Luxembourg"? It looked like Place Furstenburg. Maybe I missed something. I have to watch the movie six more times, just to study the timing accuracy and who brushes around whom, and make sure I'm right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic parallel chess games played by the Grand Master. How exciting it's all! Romane, whenever you can look through the window! Mimouns, let's talk about impossibilities, improbability, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is happening is invisible and how it affects visible. Again, we have the spirit of Breton's novel "Nadja" embodied in the great French work of art. More! More! More!
