Octavio Paz, a Mexican poet, writer and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said of "Nazarina": "Nazarin builds on the great tradition of mad Spaniards who come from Cervantes. His madness is that he is taking seriously great The humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful performance) attempts to live by the principles of Christianity, but is fired from his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her shelter after committing murder. Nazarin travels through rural roads from the turn of the twentieth century and offers help to the poor and begging for food, his two followers, the murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz, who is a suicide desperately seeking love, consider him holy, but not hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road. Bunuel tells the story in a way of Christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep, as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. Bunuel is one of the best filmmakers ever. I have seen twenty of his films and they all belong to different periods of his life, but they share their magical touch, a masterful combination of bold realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his sense of humor and his dark and shining fantasy. I am very pleased to add little to see and almost unknown but amazingly honest and touching surrealistic tragic comedy "Nazarin" to the list of my favorite movies.
