A deliciously ugly black high school club comedy (Danny DeVito) who wants to go on a mother and promise a plan to do it with a bitter divorce that wants to go on her ex-wife. The film is totally infallible in its cynicism and gives us no one to like it, but once it works for the benefit of the film rather than turning it off. Anne Ramsey, as DeVito is the ax ax's battle, steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance. Even if it's horrible, you'll end up rooting for her because she seems to be able to kick DeVito and Crystal with both hands behind her back. <br /> <br /> Stage: B +
