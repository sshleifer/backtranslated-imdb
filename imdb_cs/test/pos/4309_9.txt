If you haven't seen this movie, do it. It's genremix, as I've never seen before. Some very surrealist scenes, some merry funny things, film noir felling, musical numbers with swing, sex scenes (2nd best played orgasm on film, bested only by Sally), Orson Welles playground mixed into a work of art. As a work of art at the end, it may not be logical, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I owned a TV copy on VHS but lent it to an ex-girlfriend and now I can't get it back. But the movie should be on DVD in Austria 10.06.03 and I will definitely buy it.
