I thought it would be a fantastic story. But the subject is somewhat on the ground compared to the story of the death carriage I had expected. In fact, there is much more social drama. As usual in "European authors' films." <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, they do not exceed the average silent film. The images are not so good that they are stuck in your mind like Bergman's Smultronstället. It is true that the comparison between the two films is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with the vision of the car of death, where Sjöström's character sees his own body. There are hours without hands. He is forced to look back at what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen, Sjöström's wife does not cheat him in front of his eyes, but he wants to escape with his young children because he would never be better with him. Ultimately, Edit's confession is some living judgment. Well, I would just add that Sjöström destroys the ax door because his wife has locked her up and plans to leave with the children who reminded me of the Shining. Which was a much more fantasy story with death around.
