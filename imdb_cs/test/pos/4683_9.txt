I enjoyed the film a lot. Everything in Italy is easy. Explosive guy, safe cracker, computer genius, man on bike and man with grandiose plan to steal 35 million without using a gun. This movie is fun, though it has no central idea. It's a non-stop movie with lots of action. All stunts are beautiful. From the pursuit of a boat in Venice to the chase of busy roads in Los Angeles, including three mini-groups and even a helicopter. The best I've ever seen. I like miniscripts. Professional thieves used minisupers for passenger cars. Chase between mini-groups and motorcycles is amazing. They chased the underground. I can say I wasn't bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) have really done the job . I like actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of heist movies, but The Italian Job & is one of my favorites. Big Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of movie.
