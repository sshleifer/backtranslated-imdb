Remember when this movie was created by Robert Downey Senior. A very good fun black awareness feature that was an underground hit in California-Los Angeles, and New York at the time. hippie loved the classics where the changes in the business world are remarkable, refreshing and interesting comedies. different from 69 good for baby boomers.
