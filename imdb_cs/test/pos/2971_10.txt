When I first heard about this movie, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the music was at Elton John, so I thought I had nothing to lose, so I got it. What a surprise!!! The movie was amazing. It was real love. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxury items, no money and sometimes no food, but were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all criticized my taste, and even called me names because the film featured two nude minors. I think the movie was more realistic. Cinematography was great and showed only the great skills of director Lewis Gilbert
