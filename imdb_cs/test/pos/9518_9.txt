This is another gem from Daniele Thompson - in fact the same year (1999) she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three author / director credits. Belle Maman is primarily "French", which means, of course, other things for different people. The assumption is simple: At the altar where he married Mathilde Seigner, groom Vincent Lindon gets a first look at his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers from what the French call the coup we know as love at first sight. . Theoretically, the story is either 1) over the truth and there, assuming that the convocation has invited, or otherwise 2) just the beginning of going through the wedding, and so lives a lie until it is solved in one way or another. Thompson turns to # 2, but not without being hit by a strange undercurrent, such as Deneuve's smoking lesbian mother Line Renaud (in real life, if someone cares, Renaud is in a long-term relationship with Stephan Audran) teammates) and throws a brilliant set in the luxuriously furnished Mens Room at a wedding reception that has the form of cheerful singing and dancing. The compassionate writer, being Thompson, also chases the drama comedy as a brilliant scene where Vincent finally spews his feelings for Deneuve at a family meeting and at the same time destroys the joint. That's one of them. Again and again.
