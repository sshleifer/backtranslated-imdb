Roy Anderson 'You, The Living' includes a series of fifty special sketches, pictures and medallions in the Swedish city. Some characters are on the screen for a few seconds, while others appear in numerous scenes and sometimes loitering while appearing in a different story. Many scenes are drawn from dreams, nightmares and fantasies of strange but credible characters living in this world. It's a fascinating approach: each scene could be used in isolation, but together they have a powerful portrait of what a person is. <br /> <br /> The first half hour or so, 'You, Living is beautifully funny. Much of the humor is concentrated on the members of the brass band, whose musical practice fuels neighbors in their apartment building. However, a comic highlight is provided by a party that is terribly scary. However, after this cheerful introduction, the mood of the film darkens considerably. The dream of a party is gloomy when an unhappy hero confronts his life, creating a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes, the misfortune of casting characters is becoming increasingly obvious. It is a world in which people cannot connect with each other, where dreams, nightmares and fantasies are spoken, but where no one can be pleased, even when people get to it. A desperate woman with a refrain "no one loves me" and a young girl with unrequited love for rock guitarist Micke are archetypal characters. The World 'You, Living' is also a pernicious selfishness. An elderly professor is taken from the fire of a huge banquet to answer a phone call from his impulse son. a thief steals a purse of a ruthless executive; an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and accepts his arrival. In the weakest moment of the film, a woman in a church tells a long list of human sins when her fellow parishioners turn off during the closing time. And yet, for all the dark moments in this movie, the shared chorus of "Tomorrow is the next day" points to the ability of people to continue their lives despite the many suffering. Benny Anderson's soundtrack (ABBA of Fame) seems to be inappropriately jovial at first, but it makes more sense because the film is aware of this human ability to persevere. <br /> <br /> "You, Life" has an extraordinary visual style. The same faded, pale green colors are repeated all over the world and there is a shady shadow in sight; as a result, the characters appear extremely inflexible and create the feeling that human life is bare for testing. Almost every scene is captured in the camera's static frame as if it were photos that are revived. The few occasions when the camera moves are all the more extraordinary; the contrast between the life and movement of the big banquet is a surprising contrast to the corpse of the dressing room scene. In the most intense moments of desire and despair, do the characters direct the viewer directly to the camera? they know they are being researched and have a few moments to pour out our hearts, viewers. It's an amazing human movie.
