It is a soap opera based on applied ethical thought. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. I didn't get any emotions from this, the ideas aren't new at all, the tension is missing, it becomes tedious in the second half, but I think it's pretty interesting in a burlesque way to the end. I mean, you have a middle-aged, crippled bald guy who has more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone who has been paralyzed for more than 28 years, has no problems with God (and one would probably also expect it), people around him seem to be perfect slaves (I can't get it from my mind Bergman's screams and whispers, similar to this in many ways, that just bursts with emotions, not all of them are humane, etc. This film is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for some emotional excitement but don't expect to be blown. The film is worth seeing from all the cynicisms we receive today for its sincere intent to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to wake the viewer. Amenabar does not rub his face, and he does not take sides, he does not want us fanatics for a particular idea. Yet I have no idea why this film is so highly regarded.
