Sister Charlotte Beale (charming Rosie Holotik) came to Dr. Stephens for a patient ready for a new job. He does not expect to find another putative doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by a manic "referee" who controls the axes, Oliver W Cameron (in the running gag, whenever he confronts the situation, retreats to repeat his name). The doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick), who is not sure if Beale is suitable for their foundation. After a long discussion of this position (which is a rather unpleasant scene because two debates about Beale being sent by a letter from Stephen who got a job at a Masters clinic, he often reminded him that he was no longer in charge) The Masters agreed to let her work in a nursing position, but a good doctor doesn't have to be who seems to be. <br /> <br /> The assortment of loonies includes Sam (Bill McGee), the simple spirit of the child who was the last victim of Stephens. a lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her when she throws herself on a Masters heel like a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby) has trouble harassing who often tries to steal a fake Harriet disturbed child (Camilla Carr) Allyson (Betty Chandler) a sexy nymphomaniac who wants to be loved and hops for every man he sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin), your typical case of a soldier who has escaped the frenzy of war. The film shows unorthodox methods of a master's course in a clinic where patients can roam free with doors to all the rooms without locks that question .. and not to mention that Oliver is still allowed to walk through the mowing. Stephensa ax. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky 70's drive-in garbage is a lot of fun if you're in a warped movie theater brand. I am attracted to bizarre movies about mental rejection because their unpredictable nature ... you just never know what the hell can happen, especially in this case, when they are often allowed to walk unattended. Some view the low budget as a commitment, but in the case of this film, I think it improves experience. With low-cost photos and poor production values ​​(shooting at peanuts in a rushed house at some horrible place), it seems more creepy and I felt like a voyeur looking into the madness through the camera lens on the outside.
