Well. Photos, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a fun story that brings a smile to your face with every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit in with their part. It's the best performance I've seen from Mrs. Capshaw - she was in more movies than I thought, but that was a great success. I assume it's a lot of Spielberg money behind you, which allows a fat budget and the best money can buy technically. Two of the games have taken their own T.V. - It's easy to understand why. Tom Selleck is doing his usual good job.
