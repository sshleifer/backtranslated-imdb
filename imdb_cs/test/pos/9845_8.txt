This is typically a fast moving movie from the early 1930s. With James Cagney at the forefront, these "pre-Code" movies are even better: just the fun things you're looking at. Usually, when movies are "dated," it's negative, but not so with the 1930-1934 movies. Yeah, with slang and attitudes, dresses, hairstyles, etc., They're dating, but that's a lot of fun. These movies have the advantage of being almost always fun to view. They also have a cornea that is attractive and fascinating. You see people - as well as juvenile delinquents pictured in this movie and their parenting - that you don't see in any time, but this (early 30s). Soon on this movie, the kids go in front of the judge and you sit and just laugh at these crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of their children one by one. Yes, we get a stereotypical emotional Italian father; jewish dad; The Anglo-Saxon mother and several other mothers who are in dramatic form are "good boys". While things are predictable in some cases, it doesn't bother you because everyone who is here is so fun to watch. It also teaches you that children were punk, theft, robbing, mugging, lying - hey, that's human condition 75 years ago. This film reveals the theory that "people were nicer in ancient times." No, people have always been rotten or good. The measure was supported by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we get a lot of "Dead End" kids who end up in Reform School. The ridiculous and stupid-liberal storyline has children who act immediately as angels as soon as they appear at the reform school; in the least he was not punished for causing man to fall to his death and set fire to the institution (explanation: he was a mediator and deserved it. So much for true justice and reform); and "Patsy" shooting a guy who never had to be questioned by the police because he's a good man! Notice the subtle antiphysical digs where the only person who prays is the evil "guard". It's no accident, no accident. This kind of negative association has been happening since the Hays Code was preserved in the late 1960s and was seen, as you can see, in the precoding code of the early 1930s. Dudley By the way, kicks is excellent in his "bad" role "Mr. Thomson." Especially his voice was very effective and he could imagine playing one of the similarly bad roles as the head of the institution in the film adaptation of Charles Dickens. Cagney played his normal role, a crazy guy who gets a pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith," played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Only the sight of Darr's face believed his figure. Some thing that was the real star of the movie, but I'm still going with Cagney. The rest of the children in reform schools were not very believable and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch. I thought the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these children were and witnessed good and bad and stereotyped parents in the yard after the children were arrested. These scenes are pure 1930s Dead End Kids stuff. They have always shown that children are bad news at the beginning of the movie, but by the time the story ended, they all looked like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - barely rough "delinquents". It's very appealing, but it works fun. Overall, it's a hockey, but very funny movie, typical of Cagney movies and early 1930s. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their fun value.
