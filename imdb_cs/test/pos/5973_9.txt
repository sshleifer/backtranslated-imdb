I agree with another reviewer, this is a smashing movie that will be difficult to watch soon, though it deserves replay for quality itself. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the great direction make this film the cost of watching emotionally. There's one scene from which the two guerrillas are running through the snow to escape the patrol, maybe for total physicality, the most amazing show I've ever seen. In fact, though not episodic - the story is flowing - this is a movie of unforgettable scenes. Between the guerrillas, the snow scenes, the destroyed farm scene, the house meetings, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "output" is the arrival of the benefits. They all stand out as jewelry in a necklace. For me, religiosity is obvious. Frankly, I don't think it would be allowed in a Soviet film. I see it as an existential parable of the value of life. Here's a story where a hero - and he is a true hero - becomes a criminal and the weaker becomes stronger. Is it a mystical process or one that is given by circumstances? Is there a transformation, but comes from within or without? You have to see the film to understand the problems because they can't be discussed without getting too much story. I can't say enough about acting. It is hard for me to choose which one has more influence. I'm not familiar with the Soviet film of the 1970s and I'm not familiar with any of the actors, but they're all great. I also noticed how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giott's angelic children. There's a little confusion at the end. There is apparently a previous relationship between Sotnikov soldier and Portnov investigator, but it is left swinging. And the last scene is a bit ambiguous. However, they are quarrels compared to the overall experience. This is a movie that will mark you as a life.
