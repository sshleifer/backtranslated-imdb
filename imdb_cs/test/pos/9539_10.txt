This is a movie I love over everyone else. Whenever I can, I try to visit major film sites in Oakworth and Oxenhope, helping to restore the magical qualities that this film embodies so uniquely - reminiscent of a more subtle and diverse age, with its unspoken claims that people really do matter, family life it is not just another one-off, and that life is really worth living (though we may sometimes doubt it). In short, a film that will soon bring tears to my eyes, perhaps due to deeply evocative music - some melodies are jaunty (like Perks melodies, played trombones, sometimes with spoons), melodies when the family first met off for Yorkshire didn't know what lies ahead, and a haunted little tune played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden children-felt changes in happiness. This is just like a movie for adults and children, appealing to the eternal child in all of us - a key that reactivates effortlessly those deep and seemingly lost values ​​and feelings buried within us that are normally swept the demands of modern everyday life. It is a film about the basic human goodness and decency in which we, the audience, are left to take care of it, and there are welcome signs of humor sometimes added for good action, such as the arrival of aunt or, on a more earthly level, bedroom Perks' Bedroom Birthday - "Okay Bert - How's Your Birthday!" I have to know every scene, every line of this movie, and yet it's so much magic that every time I look, it's like I first opened a box of delicacies, savoring every moment - sometimes funny, sometimes ... ... well, very differently. As Peter says in the movie: "It's perfect - more perfect than you know". And so it is !!!
