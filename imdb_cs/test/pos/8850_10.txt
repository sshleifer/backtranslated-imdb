John The Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sadly, most of the carpenter's films are also one of the most underrated films that critics follow shortly after release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at that time people were impressed by the idea of ​​a "good" alien. The idea spawned after the success of "I.T.". And the very idea that a film that deals with extraterrestrials may deviate from this idea was considered heresy. Human ignorance is a really scary thing, people need to judge movies for what they are not, for what they want them to be. The "Thing" itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as members The American Antarctic Base is discovering the presence of an extraterrestrial being (just as a "thing" in the entire film) capable of imitating any form of life. We don't know who can or may not be a creature, we see how each character responds to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent into chaos because more and more people are becoming ... not entirely human. Carpenter succeeded in raising this film into something much bigger. than your average Sci-Fi / horror movie. There are no "what's behind you?" Jumping Moments Here. Instead, relying on the intense atmosphere of distrust and preapocalyptic despair, along with some nicely balanced moments of low-impact visual horror due to Rob Bottin's impressive effects, gives us an experience that doesn't match many other horror movies. Instead of throwing facts and elements on the desktop, Carpenter offers us a much more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what has happened in certain scenes, while giving enough conspiracy to those who do not like to interpret in films. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone works all the way. It's a minimalist and depressing sound that perfectly matches the overall tone of the movie. While I have always wondered how it would sound if Carpenter (he was known to compose all his OSTs movies except this) did he do that? Characters that are not so deeply developed are still unforgettable due to the good performances of the actors, especially Kurt Russel, who plays the "down" pilot of the R.J. MacReady. It is worth noting how his character turns into film. From his reckless "do not give up ..." attitude in honor of an ally and leader of a group of men trying to fight that "thing." But even with what has been said, there are no false heroism, there are no moments of "laughing in the face of death" and there is certainly no sort of comic relief, the film keeps its atmosphere from the first scene to the last scene. Speaking of Carpenter holding his tradition of creating a powerful end here again. A quarter of a century after his release of "The Thing" he doesn't feel dated. And with the alarmingly growing use of computer-generated effects, it feels even stronger than before, because it shows the life and work of human beings, not computers. In combination with his openness for analysis, he gives the viewer more reasons to watch him second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror we will never forget.
