This is a remake of the 80's anime classic and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are all back as Knight Sabers in their hard suits battling robotic boomers. The animation is sharp, the characters are well-developed and action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular work, so the series includes some wonderful songs. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy. DVDs also have many add-ons, including comments that really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. You must have anime for all fans. Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
