If you overlook the fact that the story was done many times, it is a hilarious and fun cartoon Looney Tunes. The animation is amazing, the background so detailed and a lot of bold coloring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the gags, especially Daffy, who constantly blow his head, are brilliantly timed. I really like the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs will win every time. I am also glad that Daffy is really greedy and ugly, while being nervously funny. I prefer it when it's manic, but it's also great fun. Bugs is still his charming and rascally himself, and Elmer is funny, if rather stupid too. In short, it's absolutely brilliant, and actually my personal favorite hunting trilogy for total fun value.
