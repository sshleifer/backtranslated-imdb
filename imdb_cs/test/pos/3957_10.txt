"Blind Spot", one of my favorite favorites. I was intrigued by the idea of ​​three strangers looking for a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each one in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is extremely amazing as a broken Los Angeles boy. His journal entries, which we hear in voice comments, work well with visual images and are very intense. The film has a strong style. Moves elements like road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective ways that capture the eerie atmosphere of lost love. There are several dream qualities, and several images are saturated with a frightening sense of tension. Strange. Tension. Beautiful view. Definitely worth seeing. I'd really like to see it again. I regularly check that Blind Spot is distributed. I can't wait to see a movie again in a movie theater or on a DVD. Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
