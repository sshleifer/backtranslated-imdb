My friends went through the time when we rented movies that none of us had ever heard of. All that came from this movie was this movie: "Take It to Limit" As soon as the movie started, we could say we were in the classics. The music is probably made by rural white boys from Colorado, but that sounds the same as in the early 1990s. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays such a bad boy, especially in the big movie sport. This movie is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but I think it's fun to have a climber trying to climb, and there's a man in the background who basically walks on a cliff. You don't want to miss this movie, you'll still see the same clips. You get a surprise at every step. You will find that you quote unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take it. Disclaimer: This movie is badly done, but that's what makes it great
