No blood, no sex (though it radiates passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that come across the screen when you really seek and catch your attention. <br /> <br /> Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful story. If there were a lot more movies like this! <br /> <br /> The sets are moving us over time and we feel we were there. Acting looks like real life, and raises us to the level of "Nanny" awareness, to whom no one is lost, least of all the inhabitants of their own "Halfway" home. Best of all, there's a real story about misfits that he learned to fit in. I was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone seemed to have in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nanny's house?
