I enjoyed "Happy Ever After" but was totally hypnotized by "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to have crashed more on the relationship between Terry and June, middle age, middle class English couple, and I enjoyed it very much, losing myself quite happily in every episode. The 1980s was an era of alternative comedy, but it was also a decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly suited more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week Terry got into a silly situation and June got into herself and usually ended up having to throw him out. Today's shows seem to be - it was a different world, but it's great fun to see trends from the 1980s - such as the CB radio story of 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981) that saw Terry imprisoned in his a car in the back of a truck! I recently watched a DVD show and still think they're amazing! He is not loved by the enlightened elite - trembling classes, but a huge hit with the masses! Great!
