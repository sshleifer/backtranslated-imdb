Young Warriors (1983) Even though it is a profoundly defective (and in some ways an idiotic) film, the way it constantly resists expectations is a decent watch for an adventurous sleaze fan. <br /> <br Meet yuppie college student Kevin and his gang of nice frat boy friends. In what starts to be a particularly unreal teenage sexual comedy, we watch this bunch of explosives and their opposites, which include, among other things, promising bricks to their genitals. The film suddenly shifts gears when Kevin's first-born sister is brutally raped and beaten by a group of cyclists who seem to have nothing better to do. When he dies in the hospital, Kevin promises revenge, much to the confusion of his detective father. So far we have left Porky's-lite, through the Last House in the Left Territory, into what is apparently forming into your typical urban vigilante revenge. However, Kevin and his gang portrait go from vaguely sympathetic until they become homicide-crazed madmen. It is the credit of the film that it does not deceive fascist rhetoric against the crime that Kevin constantly spews out, yet it is becoming more understandable that he will feel his behavior. The mood goes from light to grim and downbeat very quickly, and it's so up and up to the end that it will leave you in disbelief. And that is the strength of this film. You never know what to expect. <br /> <br /> For over 100 minutes, it's a bit tedious for this kind of fare, but you won't be bored. Badly acted for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and a somewhat stupid dialogue, it will not soon slacken someone's list of forgotten classics anytime soon. But I got a kick out of it and I'm sure everyone who reads knows if they can figure it out.
