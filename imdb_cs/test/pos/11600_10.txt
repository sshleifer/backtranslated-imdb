Many Europeans and Americans seem to see Indian movies for the wrong reason; I see some people complaining that this movie had no dance sequence! A class except their Hindu counterparts, Bengali films tend to be more realistic. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India who is widely known for his selection of subjects for movies and the power of his scripts. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. The faithful adaptation of Nobel laureate Tagore's novel about the sexual pleasure of the Bengal widow gives the director a new dimension of highly acclaimed and controversial work.
