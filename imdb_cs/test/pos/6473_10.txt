Some time ago we read the results of a survey conducted by some newspaper sports writers. The questions were only two and were brief and correct. Question number 1 asked the respondent to say who his favorite college football team is. Question 2 asked the fan to name his favorite football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is tops on both lists! Yeah, love 'em or hate' em, but you certainly don't ignore, em. The roots of this unique position of this Indepent * College Football Powerhouse are found in the life and career of one of them. , an adult, small immigrant Norweigen a Chicago boy named Knute Rockne. As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), came out relatively close to Coach Rockne's death in a plane crash in 1930. It was about 10 years after that movie was released. That would mean that the preliminary work on the project began about 8 years after the great loss of our nation by Mr. Rockn. His resemblance and voice were well known from news, radio and film news roles. Both Knute's widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and University of Notre Dame had permission rights in choosing an actor to play lead and fine script. We think they couldn't do the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks and was a college football player himself. Ronald Reagan is cast in the key role of George Gipp **, a free spirited student who goes to Notre Dame for a Baseball scholarship! He was a "soccer footballer". The bet is full of talented players. We have a Griffith veteran, Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman's Fr. Newland, Professor of Chemistry and Rockne. Gail Page seems like Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is a Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais (a passerby in this historic game of ND vs. ARMY at West Point). Riders. The real life of Big Time College coaches Howard Jones, 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear in the Congressional Probe to College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> When it comes to organic, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, everyone can only say that it will hit the ground and not slow down from start to finish. There is no needless time. The entire screen time is used to move the story. The use of the Notre Dame choir, the campus itself, and all that rah-rah brass band is marching all the music to feel like it's really there. *** <br /> <br /> * To this day, although their basketball team and other sports teams compete at the Grand Eastern Conference, Notre Dame will remain an Independent in NCAA Football. What that means is that, in fact, the Irish Combat National Plan. ** There was no such agreement with George Gipp's family. A few years ago, a trial took place on a scene depicting young Mr. Gipp who donated the famous "Win Onr For The Gipper Speech". The TV prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were minus speech in the death scene. *** Notre Dame films have been made over the years. SPIRIT NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931) featured J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne-like magician. It also featured Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as members of the true Notre Dame championship teams featuring the real Four Riders. Then of course we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical to Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing happened, did it? (Let me know, Dear Reader, THANX !!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner Brothers have always had great music, both in introductory themes and in random music. In this Rockne movie, they included NOTRE DAME to fight SONG in score. Along with him, STEP NOTRE DAME and NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, who premiered at Rockne Funeral in 1930 at Notre Dame Basilica.
