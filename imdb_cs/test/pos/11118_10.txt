This film tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to watch their dream in New York's infamous high school for art: Coco, singer, Bruno, modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, fighting dancers, Ralph, comedian, and Doris and Montgomery actors. Although everyone thinks they have what it takes to really achieve their goals, they will need much more than just their talents. They will have to deal with rejection, heartbreak, education, pain and love to achieve their glory. "Glory" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspiring films of all time. He has everything a teen drama / musical should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the amazing Irene Cara, stunning dance numbers, a very attractive cast that makes you believe in characters and a great story, including a heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, casting is amazing. Irene Cara can really act, and it's not just her singing that makes her like Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings a lot of humor to Ralph. Maureen Teefy is great as Doris, and looks closely, and you will see Paul McCrane from "ER" as Montgomery. This is a really amazing movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to stick to my dreams as an actor and singer. Any movie that pushes me so much is a winner in my book. You must see! The film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
