I loved this movie. It's not as big as "50 First Dates," but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of friends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even incredible, but what's so bad about how good a movie is good. Drew as Josie and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brotherly wannabee contributes to the good feeling of the film. With all the junk, what's so bad about the good movie that the whole family can look forward to? Without worrying about watching with your children! Drew is an amazing actress who seems largely unappreciated. This is definitely one of her best roles!
