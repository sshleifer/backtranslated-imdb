I saw the 1973 movie Horizons Lost and read many reviews of this movie. I agree that the move had many opportunities for improvement, but unlike those looking for a perfect movie with perfect songs and best acting, I was looking for something a little different and this movie gave it to me. I saw this film not as a critic, but as a man looking for little hope, a little cheering, a little relaxed from my everyday life, and that's what I got. You may be critical of acting and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to film. I'm looking for a little relaxation from my everyday life, a little time when I can sit back and imagine a better life where people love each other and help others. It is a pity that we cannot enjoy the film for what it tells us and stop choosing it as an English teacher who reads a fifth grade essay. This can be very simplistic, but it wouldn't really be nice.
