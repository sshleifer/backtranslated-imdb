See three colors: blue and three colors: white. They are both wonderful movies and will add another dimension to the Three Colors finale: Red. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in one viewing, and indeed, the film's climax is very strong in that first viewing. But watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and parallel characters in this movie, you will see new things every time you view it. With the first observation you understand that film is the work of a brilliant mind. With every follow-up you will find that it is actually a brilliant work. Red is to symbolize the fraternity in the French flag. The story transforms the theme of fraternity so that it can be seen at an angle that one would never know. Fraternity aspects shared by different characters are as profound as you care for a peer. If you're used to blatant "symbolism" in most bulk movies, you can find Rede a little slower. You may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity you don't knowâ€¦ and yawning, wondering what all the excitement is all about. This is not a thoughtless, mediated experience. Everything is not explained to you. You have to think how you look. You have to see ... not to look simply. A fabulous movie ... that was supposed to enjoy an amazing cinema.
