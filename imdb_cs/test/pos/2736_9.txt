If you repeat enough lies, how many times will it become true? 15 Park Avenue is a story of the alternative reality of schizophrenics (Mithi). The film is about her home search at a fictional address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers another masterpiece. Every movie actor was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls her role away with such ease and maturity as her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual. She plays the dominant and wildly independent older sister Mithi, who cares for her sick sister and aging mother. She refuses to accept that, despite all her strength and courage, she still occasionally feels lonely. That was easy for Rahul Bose. The role was the least demanding and anyone could do that role. The end of the film was the most realistic part of the entire avenue park. It took me a while to spend the movie that ended. He left me confused and maybe a little disturbed. But later it began to sink in. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, will I still believe his black ??
