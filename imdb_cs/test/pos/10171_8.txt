Alfred Hitchcock is a more confident story about a film he made twenty years ago, infinitely better than the original. Hitchcock thought his first version was a amateur job, and although it certainly wasn't a bad movie, he seems to be right. As already mentioned, this remake, although definitely better, is still not among the best Hitchcock works. It certainly doesn't mean it's not good, it's just more than a little exaggerated, and it pulls down. Hitchcock seems too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the movie that aren't quite relevant to the storyline, which can be annoying. Some of these overstretched sequences, such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant, are good because they help create a different culture in which our American protagonists find themselves, but there is an opera sequence for every scene in the restaurant And that is the one that makes the film worse. The storyline is followed by a middle-aged doctor and his wife who go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While they are there, they meet a French man on a bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things happen when a French man dies on a knife in his back, shortly after he whispered something to the doctor. The feast then turns into a full nightmare when a couple's son is kidnapped, causing them to shorten and go to London to find and find him. The film has a very strong degree of paranoia about him and he can do it. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that this is the most paranoid movie Hitchcock has ever done. Like most of Hitchcock's films, this one is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your place for almost the entire duration, with only the above-mentioned operatic sequence as the moment when the tension is dispersed. There is also more than just a little humor in the film that gives morbid jokes a slight relief and actually works pretty well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was bestowed with fantastic Peter's support. Lorre. Unfortunately, this film does not benefit from its presence, but it is made up of performances by amazing James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who always becomes a contender for "the greatest actor of all time". His collaboration with Hitchcock reflects fascinating performances from him, and this is no different. (Although his best performance remains the one in Mr. Smith goes to Washington). Stewart expresses all the courage, conviction and grief of a man who has lost his child and would do anything to get him brilliantly. In fact, it's one of the best things about this movie; You are truly able to feel the loss of a couple throughout and it serves to make it all more exciting. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather special choice for this film. She is definitely a good actress, but she is more connected with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is a bit strange (even though the voice chords bend a little bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; this is not Hitchcock's best movie, but there is a lot you can enjoy about it, and although I would recommend many movies before Hitchcock before I recommend it, I will definitely give it two inches.
