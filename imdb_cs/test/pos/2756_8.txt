This is a "revised" Riverdance presentation, hosted at Radio City Music Hall, New York. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals I watched in the mid-1990s (which includes the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I liked the best. I thought it was better than the original, which took place in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, has a more varied and diverse scene and eliminates the fact that two of the original they weren't good. This is a very solid show with a few weak points. Sure, there are some songs / dances that are just "fair" but none that are poor, which is amazing given that there are 20 numbers in all. The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with a major exception to Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as a featured dancer. They are both very talented. The main difference may be in their appearance with Dunne, a little goat black-haired guy, while Flatley is a pure shaved blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that he sometimes harasses. Fortunately, the leading woman, Jean Butler, is still there and it is great to watch: what lovely beauty and talent! Butler and the other women have the biggest legs I've seen on dancers. I also enjoyed the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco artist, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with the two pairs against Dunne and two other dancers -0 is called "Trading Taps" and it's a great fun, maybe watching, maybe the highlight of the show. I have no complaints or violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> I liked "fast" Irish songs the most. I appreciated the audience who didn't get in the way of the show, even with screams and screams, as women do in "Lord Of The Dance" video.
