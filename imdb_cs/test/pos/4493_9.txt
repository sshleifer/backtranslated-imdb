For those curious, this episode is based on a theme on the Pirandello game, "Six Figures to Search the Author" and a play by Jean-Paul Sartre, "No East" (as shown most obviously by his title), but, of course, with Sterling Twist. Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than putting their clothes on. The bell rings intermittently (perhaps Hemmingway's allusion?), Which increases the agony of their imprisonment. The group's newcomer, Major, is determined to escape while others are resigned to their fate. Unlike Pirandell, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing more than a room experience in their consciousness, and no one to write their story, so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandell's work. Unlike Pirandell and Sartre, there is no relationship between the characters and thus the actual conflict between them, although in this story there is a prominent theme of personal responsibility versus apathy. Although it differs significantly from the story of the authors mentioned in the title, the topics Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) go through with absolute clarity. It is probably a piece that addresses a postmodern perspective in the context of the Cold War. Emphasis is also placed on issues of personal insignificance. This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen and is still extremely relevant to current experiences (like Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into the classics.
