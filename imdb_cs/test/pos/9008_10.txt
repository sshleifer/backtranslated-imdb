It helps make the characters on which this show is based are among Disney's best. Writing is what really makes this show. It's a classic. Since you have to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy, and that is difficult to explain. Humor is similar to old school scenarios of 40 and 50 Disney, with modern turns. It never degrades to fuck jokes or something like that. It is not even Adam's humor, even though I enjoyed it. It is exactly the same humor of the movie, just expanded on for the length of time the TV show allows. So if you didn't like it in the movie, you won't like it, but IMO's New Groove of Emperors was the best thing that came out of Disney by Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
