Accepted ... see you. The only reason I decided to see the movie was the hot dog shown in the ads when Shrader (sp?) Said, "ASK ME ABOUT MY WEINER". After I saw the movie and watched it with a few of my friends ... and WOW amazing. One of the best films of the year. I laughed at the whole movie like crazy! The storyline in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) doesn't get admitted to any school he applied, so he makes another fake school for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did it to college. And so she completes and deceives her parents ... until more students are posted to the website and see the ACCEPTANCE ISE CLICK AWAY and all these refusals come to this school. They face many problems, and they just can't get anything right 10/10 LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT
