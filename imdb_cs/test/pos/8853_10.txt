When "The Thing" came out to theaters everywhere in 1982, she had a cold reception and very poor results at the box office, which was almost a failure in John Carpenter's career as a horror director; However, time has shown that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that unsatisfactory commercial results were not a film mistake. Nowadays, John Carpenter's "Thing" has won an award that rightly deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without reason, as this new version of John W. Campbell, Jr's Story "Who. Is he going there? "(formerly adapted as a" thing from another world ") is closer to the original story and holds a pessimistic sense of fear and high doses of tension in the masterfully crafted studio of paranoia. <br /> <br /> The story" The Case "begins in the winter of the year 1982 at an American research station located in remote areas of Antarctica, when crew members announce that a Norwegian helicopter is approaching. "Two apparently insane helicopter pilots are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​who gets to the US base. After the Norwegians were accidentally killed, the Americans are trying to find out what made them mad, they will soon find out that the Husky dog ​​hunted by the Norwegians was not a normal dog, but a creature capable of imitating every living creature, not only that it was hungry. <br /> <br Director John Tesar earned a place in history by driving a key slasher "Halloween" in 1978, where the tension and atmosphere were over gore and shock. be perceived as a development of this style, because although Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (which have been termed "repulsive" by the critics), the film is increasingly focusing on the atmosphere and tension rather than violent (and very well done) speeches gore. The feeling of loneliness, as well as "bad karma" among crew members, increases the sense of paranoia because anyone could be Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), ending in a situation where no one can be trusted. This element of the plot was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and the previous version was recklessly ignored (not a bad thing, just a big difference), so this version felt less like a remake and more as a new source novel concept. Bill Lancaster's script handles characters with a brilliant domain, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to fully trust them, making them an essential factor in the scary horror of the movie that is still going through the film. Secrets and tensions are at their maximum, because no one can say who Thing is and who is normal, increases paranoia and unpredictability of conspiracy with excellent results. The cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel bad feelings between their characters as real. A regular carpenter, Kurt Russell as MacReady carries the film, and with his eyes we see the madness and horror that the research station becomes when things get worse. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also amazing because Dr. Blair, a scientist who went crazy after spreading the discovery of Thing's intentions. "Thing" is a movie that is so beautifully crafted that its shortcomings tend to go unnoticed, even if they exist. The most famous of these is the very low key and sometimes the disproportionate result of Ennio Morricone. It's not completely wrong, but on some scenes it's just not in place and it's not one of the best works of the legendary composer. Also due to some shapes with special effects, some scenes have been omitted, which in fact fill some small hole plot, though nothing big or actually annoying. When talking about John Carpenter's films, most people will almost instantly name "Halloween" as their favorite movie, but personally I would go with "The Thing" because I consider it the greatest success of a carpenter and one of the most interesting and actually horrifying horror movies ever made. I'd like to go so far as to call it one of the best movies ever made. 10/10
