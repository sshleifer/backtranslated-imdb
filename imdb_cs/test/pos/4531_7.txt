The 13th and final RKO Falcon begins with Tom Conway's mutual command as Tom Lawrence aka Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No dames!" while preparing for vacation. While you are still wondering what's going on on vacation because they didn't work from the beginning of the first movie in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay though Jenkins as Goldie), bump into a woman and get dragged promised to help her when she's going to be her Uncle murdered by taking an envelope containing details of the formula to replace industrial diamonds with his Miami business colleague. Do you suspect everyone here except the cops who are after Lawrence? and Goldie for murder. To settle for Goldie still paraphrases travel brochures: "On the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cozy electric chair" for one. Some nice mild atmospheric night scenes spawn shoulders with some especially bad behavior from baddies. Favorite Bit: A dignified game of hide and seek / hunt thimble inviolable and live Lawrence has with baddies on a sleeping train. Least favorite bit: the most embarrassing scene in the series in alligator wrestling hut? definitely thrown for kids! All in all are not the best in the series, but yet another fun trip, with a generally satisfying plot and many episodes in this, which wish me to go on just a few more years as Columbia did with Boston Blackie, even though RKO was driving these swings faster. Absolutely no sex, not too much violence (in fact no high standards today), and no message of this kind make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only consider movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars. Three Diet Falconi were made later with John Calvert in the title role, I don't mind, but I could never count on them in the main series that Tom Conway himself created. time. Sad also that it was all downhill after this for Conway, who moved to television, voice overs and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 quite well in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems? I don't know if they were connected? He destroyed the poverty stricken and after the hospital spell in 1967 was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For us, people who want to have at least 10 Falcon Plus fun plus a number of other good, even classic RKO movies from 1942 to 1946 with which they remember him.
