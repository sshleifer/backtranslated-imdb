It's not about wine. No, the real goals of Nossiter are those who would streamline and customize the particularities of local (wine) production for business purposes. For this purpose he created an excellent objective film. Conspicuous, crazy, emotional and flawed wine producers are built side by side with media-finessed, anodynesprech Amercians and auld-Europeans: the winemaking art against market-driven, laboratoryized productions. It's an open show that doesn't lead to a conclusion. Nossiter's film is sometimes angry when he watches - the cameras are neither hidden nor steadicam. There is also plenty of subtitles available, as well as subtitles that can pass, often too short on screen. However it does surpass Michael Moore in the game Moore can't play anyway. The characters speak for themselves - and therefore condemn. It's worth seeing 7/10
