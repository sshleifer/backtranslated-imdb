I consider this film to be one of the most interesting films of all time. He has so many highly intelligent thoughts that anyone who thinks the film is horrible has not received it and is unable to recognize the really profound philosophical themes in it (in all 3 Schneider films) without a doubt. Several universities in Germany and across Europe have conducted a study on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person on jazz music in Germany (maybe Europe). Mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you don't like it, it's okay, but don't try to convince others that it could be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had this opinion in the discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider, you would have to "give up".
