If ever a potential movie had to sound like it didn't work on the basis of reading the script on paper, it would be this. Here we have what appears to be a grim and grim soft-film movie, complete with a huge poster in the theater depicting almost naked Christina Ricci strapped to anyone other than Mr. Bad Ass MF, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you if any movie stems from life in a grand time with soulful power to save it, it's the redeeming following Craig Brewer to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan. Unashamedly over This movie throws you upstairs from what you got into the opening scenes and goes deeper and deeper with each other frame. It is your basic story of two deeply damaged characters who will find strength and courage to go on, more positively with their lives. Previously, of course, this story, but as I've always said, it's the way the story is told that gives it a heart, depth, meaning, and power. Ricci's Damage - Wild Child Character - Child Abuse - Rae and Jackson's equally soulful musician, character Lazarus, find themselves in desperate circumstances, and Laz takes it to try and help Rae. This in itself is relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man trying to truly help a woman who is in serious pain rather than trying to use it further and know that from the outset Laz's heart and film heart are in the right place. The film at its core is about the redeeming, healing power of love (with music as a very close second) and the film resonates deeply with this truth - soul, artistically and brilliantly. The main reason the film succeeds so deeply is that it is due to the ferocious, determined performance of Ricci and Jackson. Scenes that would be ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of smaller artists are, instead, powerful as everyone gets out. Especially the movie scene in which Jackson sings and plays the house song of his own house, with Ricci, in the midst of a serious storm and insulting demons from Rae's running amok in her head, leading her to crawl to Lazarus and cling to her leg, doesn't look ridiculous it should be, but more like intestinal fragility. <br /> <br /> All supporting performances are also fantastic here. Justin Timberlake is totally believable because Rae's friend Ronnie's anxiety, and always the brilliant S. Epatha Merkerson, is also perfectly cast as a character who obviously has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is excellent, as is Laz's venerable friend R.L. (No doubt nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside). Everything works on this movie, let's get it, including music / soundtrack that features Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I listen to as I compose this review. The movie also features a really beautiful and moving version of "The Little Light of Mine", which appeared in the film, sung by heartbreaking experiment and gentle Ricco. Samuel Jackson said in recent interviews that he believes his performance in this film is the best of his career so far; I couldn't agree with him. This is a work that can be monumentally proud, along with others who are involved in this daring, supremely wise and deeply sincere mother of the project.
