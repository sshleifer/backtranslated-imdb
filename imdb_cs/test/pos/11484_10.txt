I watched this movie at least ten times. I disagree with previous comments. It is a language in the face of the film and some of the acting is to be stilted. Men like Paul Cowley are few and among them are women like Linda, unfortunately, a dime. The sad thing is that although relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frames, it's all that is known. A boy worships a girl, a girl does not know that she exists, grows up, a man sees a woman he dreamed and walked on and saves. Bottom line, she never loved him - he came at the right time and she used it. Thomas is excellent as a stupid but adequate Paul. Its display is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as a femme-fatale. What really moved me was the last scene. Paul says he finally cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for an unknown girl he'd been watching for a long time ... and longing for ... and loved. At the end, I loved Thomas closely.
