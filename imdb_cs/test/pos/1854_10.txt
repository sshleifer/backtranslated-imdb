I just watched this move for the fifth or sixth time and I'm still in love with it. It's still crying and singing and worrying and celebrating. I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt telling her how much I love him. David Duchovny's sad scene is so real! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says, "I miss Elizabeth, but I hurt for Grace." Man! I just cry for it. So ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect pair of Chicago areas! I know I swear! I'm in touch with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is in my three times a year !!! I'd watch it once a week, but I'm afraid I'll be too used to it !!! I always wanted to make it a special day when I watch it!
