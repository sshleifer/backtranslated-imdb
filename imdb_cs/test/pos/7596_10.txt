It doesn't matter if they are drawn or leelee total girls, but there's plenty of girls that are so nice and hot, but they seem to be so nerdy. This film is not an Oscar-type movie, but at least has a good look at what life is like for young people or for "real" people. This made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this film represents the real world and what matters.
