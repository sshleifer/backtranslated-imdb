Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Yet it is one of her first films and comedy. Give her a break! Sure, the film is at best average and pale compared to its former counterpart w / Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is (a piece of fluff), it's pretty fun to watch. I haven't heard anyone throwing him out of work, or even with adjectives other than "horrible", "bad", or other such vague descriptive words. If you want to see a bad deal or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston? She had the most irreplaceable business success of any actress in history, and couldn't go out of the hatbox. Of course, the American public cannot distinguish the difference between credible film performance and stellar power. I think Madonna has always been trusted in her films. Get real people. Madonna-assault is so 90's.
