Some say this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; For the first time I saw this series I was in the video store, people around me started laughing, no matter the age or gender. The teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in the book, the beginning must be fun and the end should not be obvious simply by reading the last page. During the first minutes of the series, the boy is hit by a car, the same car appears during the last moments of the series. I can't regret buying these serials.
