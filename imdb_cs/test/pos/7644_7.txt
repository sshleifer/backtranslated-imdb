I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time. The director has done a great job. When I started, I was completely absorbed into this film. Norman Reed's performance is fine. I expect more cooling films from him. I was so absorbed that I sometimes wanted to catch a Norman gun and shoot the snake girl. Hehe. I like movies when innocent looking girls play really smart with men. The end was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of twists of moments. You expect it, but something else will happen. Initially, these massive images were very sharp to make the eyes uncomfortable. Although not proven when Norman Reedus changed the banknotes? Or I stand by the fridge. :)
