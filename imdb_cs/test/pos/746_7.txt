DO NOT FIND IN BASE This little forgotten gem has a special place in my heart and in the Nasties Video List. The flute-sitar-rattle sound track is classic. The main character, although much warmer than most low-budget stars, is a very common low-budget star. The Master Doctor's character is well written and worked well. Some of the smaller characters are a little silly, but they add to the nostalgia of the film. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes this great is Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanatorium-off-crazy movie. Gore is quite standard, though I think the blood color is amazing. It is so. I believe this movie was badly accepted because it was an advertising system. Some mindless little advertising manager took his hands at him and thought, "Let's rip out the AD Camp for the Last House on the Left, that's good". Such little chumps destroyed the world of film. All balls and no brains. Also, the editor may or may not be an alcoholic. Maybe they're all drunk. You'll see what I mean. One more small note. Don't buy it from the Wally-Mart dollar stand. They cut her to a level she was unable to. Try to find the longest cut you can.
