Is it in the spirit of comedy of errors, misconceptions going from one to another, flowers and transitions? Flares of passion, sparks of fire scattered and extinguished? Guess maybe loves, loves or loves ??? A circle of emotions, evolving, relaxing, but not hiding? They want to let him know, they want to let her know if they let them know? A good set cast despite the seemingly confusing mix of emotions of different stakeholders. It's a refreshing charmer, casual, free and easy and more on the ground - not Hollywood Hollywood like "Notting Hill" but a lot of human feelings, fragility, vulnerability and flowing. Yes, they all turned around a random (lost and found) love letter. Kate Capshaw as owner of a city bookstore, with a number of characters portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as seemingly untouched by Mrs. Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love lurks everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another quirky little movie that's fun to watch: Capshaw has amazing chemistry with David Arquette and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). "Notting Hill" satisfies its story of spinning around Julius Roberts and Hugh Grant's glittering duo and the wonderful support of his (London's) friends circle. "Love Letters" is wonderful in its quirky (Loblolly) small town-ness, and its story includes Kate Capshaw's skewed ripple effects on her friends and neighbors. Both possibly fantasy, somehow, the latter felt more attainable if it should happen to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it can be a movie for you.
