This cinematic biography of the early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlight of the film is Busey's theater performance, where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. Bringing such energy to the performance that Holly's performance almost faded. Busey's infectious toothy smile lights up on the screen, creating an absolutely believable and winning personality, and his Oscar nomination for Best Actor has been earned. Star and New York and his premature death in a plane crash. One thing I considered interesting, if true, was Buddy's car ambition - he had big plans to go beyond recording and performance to produce. As young as he had already established himself as a clever businessman, he definitely wanted to take things higher. We will never know if he would eventually catapult his first success into a brand such as The Rolling Stones. The lyrics of many Holly songs are quite teenage; read the lyrics for "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and see what I mean. Perhaps this largely explains his popularity with teenage audiences, but his instrumentation and theatrical performances certainly account for his influence on the groups that follow - both The Rolling Stones and The Beatles acknowledged its importance. Sure, some freedoms have been adopted for a dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly ever went to a producer in Nashville, or that viewers at the Apollo Theater in New York immediately reacted that they were dancing wildly in the aisles. If you're interested in getting closer to the truth, check out "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985), which is produced and hosted by the very relaxed and engaging Paul McCartney. It includes interviews with the Holly family, friends and band friends (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in the article "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories and there are shots of old Holly performances. McCartney's production may stand on his own, but it makes an excellent companion piece to "Buddy Holly's Tale" and perhaps should be required to view for anyone who has watched a fictional story.
