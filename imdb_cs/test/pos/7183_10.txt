Eh oui, impossible n'est pas gaulois. <br /> <br /> A good walking, very entertaining movie. Very good knowledge of French language and knowledge of modern France (and history) are recommended. I don't think this movie really works in another language. The movie is incredibly much better than the previous one (In Search ...). In addition to great actors and savvy cameras, it's a joke and firework of allusions, word games, etc. That make a really great movie. Cartoon vorlage is recognizable, but the film is very emancipated. The price of the film is well used. In fact, all special effects in the film fit naturally, you never feel choked. Bref, oui, les 2CVs, în traîne un peu mais à part cela, Imhotep! > <br /> - A piece from the other side of the Rhine
