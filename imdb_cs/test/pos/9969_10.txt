It's a risky business to shoot such a rich production of "The Merchant of Venice". It could be a tense, wooden, period work, or it might be ridiculous for its excesses. This version is not. While I'm not fully sold by Al Pancino's very restrained Shylock, he does competent and honest performance. Antonio Antonio Jeremy Iron is, as always, with his tortured own roles, riveting. Some of the smaller roles seemed to be in the spirit of stormy entertainment, the "adventurous story of a Venus boy", a little too much, but the central plot is pushed forward by the film effectively and compassionately. Of course, location shots, costumes and interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> One thing I don't want to comment on is the game's anti-Semitic content. The film is as sympathetic to the Jews' hate as possible, while still portraying Shylock as an instrument of self-destruction. It is a sad note that four centuries later, the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuances before the premiere screening at the Toronto Film Festival. It's a beautiful movie and I look forward to seeing a few views.
