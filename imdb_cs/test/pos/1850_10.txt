I saw this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (not to mention the fun of supporting support!) They never create such movies ... never! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) learns about the death of her friend and that she has the heart of a deceased woman and she shouts, "WHAT'S RUNNING THINK? I believe that everyone (no matter who you believe) has such thoughts once in a while. But even though it's very happy, it could cause you to believe in true love and fate for once and for all. especially in the above scene, it's horrible and yet so funny!). They make a good pair, and I hope to see them again. 10/10 Stars
