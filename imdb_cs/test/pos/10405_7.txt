I can't praise this movie enough. It had a lot of the hand that trembled in the first person and who loved (and some hate because it was sick) like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> a long movie for its kind, but I didn't even notice because the movie was so interesting. By displaying shots from the work of a paranormal reporter, the film keeps pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. Although I would never say this movie as "the most scary horror ever" I must say it's definitely one of the best I've ever seen. The fear factor is based on the details in the images, camera defects, the events associated with them, and which give the film a very mysterious and spooky tone. Horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imagination. The end is perfect and warned that you can have nightmares afterwards. However, a second review is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch the same in the dark, don't expect anything and have fun.
