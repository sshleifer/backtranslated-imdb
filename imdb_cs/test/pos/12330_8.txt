I can't describe the feeling when I got a lousy VHS tape for rent 20 years ago. Somehow I got my father to rent it and I watched it twice with my little brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This film was originally rated as PG in the US, and in many other countries, including Finland, it was limited to 18 or 16 years. The film was aimed at teenagers, but it must be the bloodiest movie with PG rating. There is no bad language or nudity in what so ever. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves a few years before release. This is a class B class B movie, a true, well done horror movie of 80 years. A bunch of college girls decides to spend the night in the mausoleum without knowing that the supernatural evil is waiting ... <br /> <br /> You can almost feel rotting meat and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's campy, absolutely stupid, but they just can't do these movies anymore. This horror genre of the 80s is sure to be certain. This one is still effectively scary and fun after all these years. The effects are just the emanating quality of Ellis Burman Jr and Thomas R. Burman. Make-up effects play a big part in this movie, otherwise it would be just a boring teen slasher. It's now available on DVD at last and it's a special edition of DVDs including some add-ons too. The commented track is interesting. <br /> <br /> (In fact, this version isn't so special after all. Under-average DVD transfer, some glitches and scratches here and there) Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled, so Shriek Show released without resuming printing. Too bad!) <br /> <br /> Great data-movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I gave only 8 out of 10 because of "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
