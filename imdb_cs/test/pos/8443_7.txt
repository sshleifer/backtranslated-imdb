It's been a few years since I saw this movie, so forget most of the details. But I loved it at the time and found that the conspiracy clutched intensely, the peak of calm stopped. I remember being in 1979 literally on the edge of my theater seat. Jane Fonda plays a reporter in Los Angeles, Kimberley, who encounters an accident at a local nuclear facility. She wants to go with the public with the story, with the help of her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas), who photographed the event, but a sinister plot tries to cover it all up. Jack Lemmon is absolutely amazing in the role of a conflicting middle manager of a nuclear power plant, torn between loyalty to his company and "in the right way" by reporting a dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak loud here. This film, in addition to a thrilling plot and thrilling tension, is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his great acting performance. As for Jane Fonda (I was a huge fan of her company at the time), I suspect she has just withdrawn from her anti-war protests in order to accept the nuclear industry. This movie seems to be a nuclear terror tactic. Regardless of Chernobyl and Island Three miles (different types of reactors) is our Canadian CANDU reactor worldwide safe and well respected. I would not hesitate to stay near a nuclear power plant for about an hour by car, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Apparently they closed for every small problem, regardless of the financial loss. Honestly I doubt there are any conspiracies. It is hard to imagine that any of the managers or highly trained operators who are willing to risk any kind of breakdown or anything ... is absolutely stupid. Of course, morale is to save no cost or effort in building equipment or ensuring its lasting security. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western lifestyle, we need to get our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear energy can never be completely safe (of course, of course), they might voluntarily volunteer for coal mining or return to preliminary electricity. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this fun and very exciting movie, which is probably based on a true story. It's a real cooler, thriller and maybe even a killer, but please don't take your attitude to the operation and safety of nuclear power plants.
