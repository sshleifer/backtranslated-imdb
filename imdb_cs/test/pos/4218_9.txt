The film was surprisingly amazing, especially with regard to the last sequel. The third was dark and semi-interesting, but it was not so much fun or pleasant. It is filled with comedy lines about Marta Stuart, doll anatomy, masturbation, and it was actually done efficiently during horrifying and disturbing images. The film wasn't frightening or exciting and I'm sure it wasn't the director's intention. It was fun because of stupidity, Jennifer Tilly is on top and sexy performance. The puppetry of the dolls was so well processed, the movement of the mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, the knife in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were just amazing and made terrible deaths much more enjoyable because they were made by beautiful dolls. The new Chucky looked great and Tiffany was very cute. A few scenes with Chucky, who embraced human Tiffany, even smiled. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly very attractive and the special effects were cool. The end was so unsuspected, and the fact that they could do another as good is quite unlikely. It may not be as tense as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun !!!!
