I saw this movie as Skywalker02, but when I was able to see it again and formally train film, psychology and life, I had time to really take my hand and start hitting me, I really click on the movie. I recall that pay for cable channel services almost did this thing to death, as did the poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular movies. I felt then that it was not worth the commotion and constant "posting" (I know the cable is not in the air), but it was a very young and adult drama situation should not and should not work. However, the recent film viewing has enlightened me on film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald probably studied the script together and I would be a little surprised if Surandon trained Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, though good, do not have this potential depth as this role. Surandon nailed her as Raul Julia also did. Cassavettes and wife brought in acceptable performances, but sometimes I admit that this is the first class. Steady ebb and tide for acting takes place in many scenes, but overall I see why the story might require the dynamics to become more subtle. All in all, I won't find this movie to "take me and drown me" kind of boredom fest as Skywalker02 would have believed. I think that maybe with the right psychological training and a little more difficulty in home life, strategically placed in combination with some film courses, this film would seem different. I would say that if you feel a little melancholy and longing for a simpler life and have your share of marital disagreements between dysfunctional family units, then this movie may provide more insight and fun than you think. I feel it's a classic and much more entertaining than mainstream movies that should share many of the same elements, such as the Endearment terms, which, as far as I am concerned, can be rid of a few extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson, then burned solely until nothing not left. (How could a movie get more attention than this. Talk about boredom.) Best thing, don't take my word or anyone else, look at the movie and support our industry.
