As Salinger's "Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with suicide miraculous, this film opens with the death of a star swimmer legend, Matt, who shoots himself into the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. But the death of Matt Travis serves as the key to unlocking the door of another miracle, his brother, Tim, who has never seriously bothered in his life with the question, "What shall I do?" When he discovers that his brother is dead, his the head is broken like a fallen watermelon, the Travis family is beginning to vomit their secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. She is a victim of bullying, domestic violence, family alienation, heart breaks, sexuality and friendship issues. Tim reveals his wounds with physical bruises, but he is not the only wound of his person, as we slowly realize how the script painfully reveals the origin and outcome of Tim's scars. Anyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character quite well, revealing the frame by frame in the visual expression of his body, the amount of conflicting emotions inside the child's soul, which no one seems to listen or know well, they do not know and do not know about their depth. soul and amazing talent. Two siblings sharing a doobie, curled up on a red turntable, asks Penny, "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed by a familiar, repetitive picture of the film: a comfortable playground where Tim seems to feel at home, shot from the air, because with each character Tim feels good that he can share part of himself, and we see these intimate views moments shared in a red, spinnable saucer with children's graffiti carved in pencil from above. After he barely advised him to go through the joint, Penny tells him: "Tim, well, the secret of life success is finding something you love. And you have to do it for the rest of your life? good, because if you don't, then you're probably not going to succeed. "This simple advice from Penny serves as the main theme of the film, the responsibility of the talent and the possibility of failure. Why does one person have a talent that cannot stand, like Matt, who hated the attention his glory brought, but no one notices Tim's talent? Nobody ?? because no one asks him? Not us either. The film points out that we ourselves do not know Tim, just as we thought we did when we first met this handsome, sad, man; in our intimate understanding of Tim as we progress, we are warned that not everyone is as it seems. Is that the other side of the film, the failure of those who should? parents, friends, teachers ?? who? to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. Even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, does not see Tim's gift, despite her love for her son. Weaver does a clever job of a middle-aged woman struggling with her own inner demons as she happily tries to play the role of home life and support. When Tim is found to be bullied at school, the boy's trailers are storming, he threatens his life, "You can tease me, torture, blow, drive a drunk with me, I can forgive you. Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but with my child you do not hold up and God Himself descends from heaven to protect you, for as long as I live? sleep at night just dreaming about ways to turn your tiny insignificant lives into hell on earth. After throwing a paper cup into her mother's face, she looked around the trailer and looked at them both the baby and his stunned mother, comments, "nice trailer", and walks away as quickly as she came. Weaver scores in your gusto wrestling skills with a visceral joke that is sour and witty. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, and treats him as a stranger, not telling his family that he has left the office, spent days in the city park, heard, carved the soul and sleeps in Matt's bed, tucked into a jacket in college. Jeff Daniels is doing a great job of believing that he can be both a bastard and so nice because we are growing up to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son. In the emotional scene Tim confronts his father. When you think his dad suits him, he grabs him to hug him. He won't let him go, he tells Tim, "I'm your father and you're my son, and I'm fine here, but you have to talk to me. I don't know how to do it myself." This is here at the moment in a movie that a father tells his son, you have to tell me what's going on inside you, you have to tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a spectacular moment, a visual movement from Tim, angry and lonely, to his father who embraces him as he smashes and cries and reveals the emotions hidden under his cloak. Tim is experiencing this moment of cleansing with his father as a catharsis, especially when considering ill-treatment, manipulation, disrespect, violence, and betrayal that the film has been dealing with in the long year. I recommend this movie.
