We just finished showing El Padrino in Australia. The phenomenon of film. We look forward to seeing many more of Mr. Chapa's films in the future. It was amazing to see such a well-formed film with such a tension and story that would remain an instant classic. In fact, the vision of a film with great quality outlines Chap's serious potential and his skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa impressed with many of his triumphant performances in "blood in blood," and has now demonstrated to all those who have seen his work his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control. With his lead role Kilo Vasquez is the perfect combination between Milo Big of "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino of "Scarface", the film will do wonders for us here in Australia.
