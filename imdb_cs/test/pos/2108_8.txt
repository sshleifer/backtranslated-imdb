Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure fun from start to finish because of its outrageous characters, meaningless conspiracy and lack of any prejudice. The creators of this film gave us a truly OTT masterpiece that must be seen to be believed. The plot focuses on Wu Tang's thief, the White Abbot, who wants to destroy Shaolin monks and become the highest martial arts operator. To do so, will he join the Ninjas clan led by three masters? gold lame ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja ??? and succeed in destroying Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. Their job is to pass on Shaolin's finger-dropping knowledge to a new generation who must beat the ninjas and Abbott White if peace and order are to be restored. Unfortunately, Abbott White is a heavy enemy to defeat because he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks (an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nudity!). Other store gifts for the audience include a lot of very impressive fights (despite some being accelerated), some really amazing clothes (the aforementioned golden lame ninja, Abbott White Yin Yang suits, and even Even some murderers who wore swastika tunics), the ninja turned into a flying carpet, plus some kitschy gore for good action. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows on display in this movie? certainly a good reason not to give up on this gem.
