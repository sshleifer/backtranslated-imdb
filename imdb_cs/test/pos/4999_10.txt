The hottest, most engaging film of his genre, the lips, those eyes, made me smile and cry, reminding me of the work he needed to realize the dream and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are excellent and the story seems to be alone. The brilliant scenario of David Shaber (one of my favorite - see more The Warriors and Nighthawks for more ...) and beautiful sets filmed locally (I think) at the current summer theater in which the story takes place. You can't see this movie and you don't want everything to fall and get into the theater! If you find it, check this video.
