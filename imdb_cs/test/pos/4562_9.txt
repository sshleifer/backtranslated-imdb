It is one of the most satisfying books for television adaptations. The actress who makes us believe that Borg could be sexy leads us to believe that a spy and a traitor may have some redeeming qualities. The TV series of the TV series does not follow Cornwell's story exactly, but it is exciting and rewarding as telling a damn good yarn. If you have a yen for romance in uniform, there is a lot of sexual energy between our husband Sharpe and the lying capelin. I wished her role was closer to that in the books. But no matter how many heroes, the hero is redeemed, the hero in rage, the hero in flight and the hero in battle to keep you in touch with the DVD.
