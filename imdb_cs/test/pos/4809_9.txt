I bought An Zhan on the DVD (running time) and it was a great movie I have to say. It's not really action-packed in terms of weapons, but definitely exciting and funny. I don't think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the cut on this movie was very well done. Look now, when you're a Lau fan or HK thiller / action movie!
