Okay, I'm Italian, but there's not so much Italian film. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie, but the finals are too simple, too predictable. But it's the only little mistake. The consequences of love in my opinion have great succession especially at the beginning and a great soundtrack. I'd like a lot of lighting work. The best part is a big, great actor. Now, if it was called Al Pacino, everyone would still talk about this performance. But he's just a great Italian theater actor named Toni Servillo. Yes, somebody tells me this movie and this kind of performance is too slow, it's so boring, so much silence, but I think these components are fantastic, it's the right way to describe the love story of a very talented young girl, an Italian actress granddaughter Anna Magnani, Olivia and old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian movies.
