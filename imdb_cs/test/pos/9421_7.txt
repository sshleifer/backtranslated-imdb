Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the second in the Universal series, is once again based on a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and covers time. This helps to conveniently set things here in the "current" era of the early 1940s. In this offer, Holmes goes through several different disguises (with Rathbone being very prominent features, it is likely that people really wouldn't recognize his true identity?) when protecting physics from the Nazis as well as from Holmes Professor Moriarty's greatest nemesis (now playing Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb that will greatly aid in aerial bombing, and he has promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to empower him to sell them to the Nazis. The good entry was a little boosted by the participation of the right villain Atwill, who is now cast as Moriarty (though George Zucco was no slouch) in SHERLOCK HOLMES ADVENTURE). It's always interesting to watch Holmes and his greatest enemy, who humorously jokes together ("Needle for the Last, eh, Holmes?").
