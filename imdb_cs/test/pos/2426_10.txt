Above all, let me say that this film is not for everyone. He has a very special subject. Spinster living alone and living boring life reveals a young man in the park just across the street from her townhouse. He notices him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm. The man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf. Yet he is fascinated and sexually interested. She feels strange and continues her silence, though later we find that she is not silent and that she reports to her sister everything that happens between him and his wife. I won't forgive the rest of the land. If you can find this movie watch. You can't take your eyes off this. What's so interesting? It's absolutely unique. I've never seen anything like this, and watching these two things is very annoying. Especially when you find out what a rude, boring, obsessive spinster is capable of. You won't forget it soon.
