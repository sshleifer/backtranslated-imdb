The show is great. No words to describe it. Beautiful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they weren't * bad *, but because the show is really * good *. <br /> <br /> Editors are compulsive tools that don't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 seconds. It's okay to show different angles, but those guys worked with more cameras for the first time in their lives, and they remind you how many cameras have every five seconds on average ... and show the rest at a different angle. No matter how much they tried, they couldn't spoil that wonderful show. It's for lovers of dance and music.
