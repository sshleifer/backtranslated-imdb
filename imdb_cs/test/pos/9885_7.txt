In "Checking Out", Peter Falk plays an older New Yorker who calls his kids home so they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the film progresses, we see deficiencies and other problems. While some people may interpret it as a "pleasing" movie, I usually enjoyed it for Peter Falk's character, who didn't allow him to pull something down, and even got involved in a little thing right now. <br /> <br /> may not be the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. For a long time I thought Peter Falk had a perfect look to play this role with his glass eye and everyone. Also star Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's Real Wife).
