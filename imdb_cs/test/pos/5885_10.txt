The film presents another exceptional collaboration by director William Wyler and cinematographer Gregg Toland, the first to work Toland on Citizen Kane. However, the talent of these two men focused on achieving a perfectly crafted film that was, in a good old American sense, seen as a great story. The technical aspects of the film are covered so that the viewer is absorbed into the action that takes place on the screen without undergoing the power of the image. The technique is perceived as a means of representation, unlike Citizen Kane, where Welles' Baroque style has almost drawn attention from the story to the way the story was told. One of my favorite deep-focused moves in this movie is the drama mediated by Homer and Al's return home. If Homer's girl, Wilma approaches him perfectly, Al goes to his wife also perfectly in focus. It is a great step, because it shows that the mere use of the image is the nature of these relationships, as we will see throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and accepts him as he is, wife Al also loves him but feels unprepared to welcome him home. Also later in the film we find that their marriage was not always the rose of roses. Wyler is a director whose power is to be faithful to his work without feeling the need to brag. He wanted to show his audience how hard it was for American soldiers to return from war to fit into a society that either did not understand or treated them with contempt. With perfect casting and great dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler have created a movie that will be a template for all other returning home movies forever. Three hours that coincide with "rough cut" because the test audience has never felt for a moment that the action is slow and every scene in the movie seems to be justified. The whole thing is beautifully designed, each character gets enough exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is quite lamentable that Hollywood is never able to bring so many character conflicts to the screen today. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American way of life, American family and society to the point that other films look like a "children's hour".
