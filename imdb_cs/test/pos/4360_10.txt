Wow.this it's a moving story! First I saw the 'Rescue Dawn'. And now I saw the man, Dieter Dengler, whom this story tells Herzog. Very Impressing.Dieter is a controlled human being who has met the most opposite emotions in her life on this earth. led. His story of capturing Patet Lao / Vietcong, and thus his suffering, is frightening, but what is most impressive is his incredible will to survive. Dieter tells us in a haunted spirit about his terrible suffering in his captivity ... he's a great storyteller, and Herzog deserves the righteousness of this brave man. <br /> <br /> In my opinion "Little Dieter needs to fly" says everything! Leaving nothing to the imagination, so do 'rescue of the dawn' redundant film. Horror is no more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself.
