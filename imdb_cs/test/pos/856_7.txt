Stephanie Meyer will be so ticked! Now, her book "Breaking Dawn" won't be the first with this title. Sorry, Twilight fans. Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student at Eve who is interviewed by psychotic Don (James Haven - brother of Angelina Jolie). I suspected it was, and when she found out that they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of that. Still deeper and deeper with your patient to the point that I felt there was a continuing illusion. Sometimes she acted like a PTSD. I really thought he was losing her. Well, she didn't lose her and when the end came, I was on the floor. My whole suspicion was bad. The twist was even more amazing than I believed. Overton was fantastic and the story is much better than something Stephanie Meyer would have come up with. You must see.
