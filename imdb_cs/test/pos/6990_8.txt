This was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks !!! The event will be nonstop and I bought a special edition DVD with an animated story in the background similar to Animatrix. This will give Vin Diesel the center of attention, and hopefully he will get a sought-after role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the most logical choice for this role. Back to PB, this movie, though it's an independent thriller, has a great story and characters with a background that screams to learn more. If they were to do books or comics, it would be great reading. One thing I felt was a little unfinished. The end needed a bit of work, but not every movie would have the best ending.
