I loved this movie and watch it every day. I think that although acting is not so great, it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with the script. I've been looking for this movie for a year, almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I had to get it. This is now, by far my favorite movie of all time. It deals with the failure of relationships and at the same time it is a joke. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for grape grapes while sitting on the porch, and he tells him to eat the one that rolls down the porch. This really renders it as it is. The part in "Creation" really touched me when they contacted Brandon Novak about heroin addiction, and how much his friends and family tried to help him. The new film, which is in production, called "Dreamseller", is in production, which is about the story of Novak's dreams, broken by his addictions.
