Why Jessie Matthews, one of the best British music stars, was in this film between her brilliant "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen"? When I first saw it, I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her singing and dancing - she was billed as "Millie - a non-stop variety girl," but there were more stops than the variety. Now I see this as a good little drama. Br /> <br /> It's a bus crash and stories that lead to it, about people on the bus. Apart from Jessie Matthews, who is great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays his fiancee (yes, that's true). Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to perform in Lassie and Natalie Wood in "Miracle on 34th Street", plays a grumpy businessman. Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. Emlyn Williams - who wrote "Night Must Fall" was a black-mailing villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil Doll" is a young man in trouble "" Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time, was a bus conductor.
