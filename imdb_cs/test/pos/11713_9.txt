In short, if you want to watch Burt Reynolds the best movies than this must be included. If you don't like Burt, you might like it. If you love Burt it can become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta, it's hit home, but it's also nice to see a cop / action / drama that takes place somewhere else than NY City, Chicago, Miami, or LA. The film is humorous at points with good conspiracy and good performance from a big support cast (every character is real and the bad guys aren't so one-sided they're really well thought out). some good old fashion shootings & fistfights (no CGI thank God to REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood made his best impression of the Burt Reynolds movie with "Every Way But Loose" & "Any Way You Are Can "then Burt replied with his best Clint type flick with this, and it works great!
