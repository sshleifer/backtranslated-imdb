Susie Q is a great romantic ball movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a great job. I hope that Disney sometimes made this movie on DVD. I think it's a little cool and a little cheerful. It's a bit sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident at the beginning when you want to cry or sob. But on Wednesday, when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little secret in this movie, but not much. Yet I would recommend this film to the whole family if they like comedy, mystery or a romantic type of movie. That's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is Cute.
