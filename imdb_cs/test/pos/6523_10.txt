"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad!" is a cheerful show that is Saturday morning at WB. He's the star of Coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and every episode is their very funny misfortune. Most of the time it's because of Coconut Fred's troubles that he is making fun, and other things happening on the island at the same time. Humor is great and nobody on the island is at all clear, adding that it's as fun as it is. I don't think it could be fun. The character's voice talents are superbly superior and exaggerated, making the show angry. If it's ever on DVD, I get it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for good laughs.
