Usually, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'Big Boys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . list of cowboy stars. But in this B + movie, he dealt with something remarkably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be really one kind of Western. The main character played by Victor Mature is a shepherd / mountain man and is usually romanticized in films - Robert Redford at Jeremiah Johnson, a kind of thing where the hero is not really a typical mountain man, but a clean cut. a heroic character who hangs with real mountain men. Not here. A true mountain man - vulgar, rude, animal - is one central figure and it is something to be seen which gives the mature one of his better positions. Real actors' chops are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as the suicide commander of Custer's cavalry and James Whitmore, Spencer Tracy of a poor man, as another of those old timers who feel trapped among more and more hostile Indians on one side. and the emerging forces of civilization on the other. Even more impressive is the very young Anne Bancroft as an officer's wife who is initially discouraged by the very sight of a mature person of mature age, and then discovers that her own veneer of civilization is slipping away as she becomes aware of her own shock. to him. Rarely, if he ever has a distant fortress on the edge so precisely on-screen, without the romantic temptation that John Ford has put such a place in his Fort Apache masterpiece. The battle sequences are large and remarkably violent and especially impressive if you have seen them in widescreen format. Good show, and underestimated film, all around.
