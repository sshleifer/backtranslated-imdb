There is a sign on the Lost Highway that says: <br /> <br /> * THE MAIN SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew that, didn't you?) <br /> <br /> Since there are a lot of people who probably didn't get the meaning of this movie, I would like to contribute to my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others point out, one view of this movie is not enough. If you have a DVD from MD, you can "cheat" by looking at David Lynch's "Top 10 Hints to Unlocking MD" (but only for second or third viewing, please.);) <br /> <br /> all, Mulholland Drive is absolutely ingenious. Masterpiece. This is the kind of film that refuses to leave its head. Often DVD comments are not very accurate, but Vogue's "It gets in your head and stays there" really hit the mark. David Lynch deserves praise for creating a film that not only has a beautifully stylish look - cinematography-wise, has a great acting performance (especially Naomi Watts), a scary soundtrack Badalamenti, and a very dreamy quality - but everything he can handle the viewer in such a way that he has several films before. (After all, when you last saw a movie that wouldn't leave you in mind and everyone felt compelled to talk and write, whether they like it or hate it?) <br /> <br /> All right, enough about all this, it's time to justify these statements. Most people who have gone through some effort to try to build the land together have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion / succession of dreams. Of course, it's too bad for all those who try to expect the film's meaning by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is interpreted in a timely, logical and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I ask you to check the director's name and come back again. MD is a story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn, a would-be actress who is hopelessly in love with another actor Camilla Rowles. Given the lack of talent, Diane is constantly striving to pursue her career and feels she has failed to meet her parents 'and parents' expectations. After realizing that Camille would never be her (C. being involved with Adam Kesher, the director), he hires the hitman to get rid of her and then has to deal with the guilt he produces. The film first starts with what may seem like a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is about a 50s dance / jitterbug contest in which we can see the main character Betty giving great performance. We also see an older couple (which we'll see twice in the movie) with her and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see for the first time they see it. There is actually another very important fact that is given before the credits - the camera moves to the object (even if it is blurred) and the scene disappears quickly. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow that shows what follows is a dream. The main characters they saw in the first half of the movie: Betty: The Imaginary I Diane Selwyn, used in the first half of the film, which represents the "Dream Sequence" - a positive portrayal of a successful, An aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). The name was "Betty", which is the name of the waitress in Winkies. Note that in the dream version, the name of the waitress is 'Diane'. Rita: Fantasy version of Camille Rhodes, which is through Diana's dream and through imaginary car accident, turned into amnesia. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then appropriately placed in Betty / Diane's aunt's luxury home that Betty was allowed to stay in. Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In a dream, a woman in charge of a housing complex in which Betty stays. It is above all a strong authority figure, as seen in both parts of the film. Adam: Director. In the second half, we know that he deals with Camilla. His only purpose in being in the first half of the film is to serve only as a punching bag for Betty / Diane because he hates him. Aunt Ruth: Diane is a real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money her aunt left and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. Mr. Roach: Typical Lynch character. Is not real; appears only in the order of Diana's dream. He is a mysterious, influential person who controls the chain of events in his dream trolley. He serves much of the same function as the back-talking dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. Murderer: A person who kills Camille. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although it is rendered in a somewhat miserable fashion in the succession of dreams (more below). Now that we've created different versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to plunge into the plot. Of course, I will not go into every little detail (nor do I interpret it chronologically), but I will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to Lynch's "hint-list". As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as an amnesia despite her unlikely survival of the car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very interesting with MD is that Lynch constantly gives advice on what is real and what doesn't. I already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow, but notice how two cars approaching the limousine are approaching each lane. Only one of the cars really hit the limo; what about the others? Even if they did not save themselves for the accident, wouldn't they try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that since it is a dream, the presence of the second car is postponed and forgotten. Given how Rogert Ebert so eloquently says, "As true dreams, it does not explain, does not complete its succession, it persists over what is fascinating, rejects an uncompromising plot." from the Mulholland crash site Dr., and goes down the hill and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see the creepy old couple who leaves away, staring at each other and smiling at each other and the camera. This is the first sign that what we see is a nightmare. Although the old couple seem to be unknown to Betty, I think they're actually her parents (because they clapped her on the jitterbug). Maybe she didn't know them all so well, and in fact she didn't have as good a relationship with them as she wanted, and so she turned out to be very pleasant and helpful in her dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt for murder, and Diane feelings of failure in terms of her uncontrolled goals in her life. The relatively long and cheerful scene is the hitman. Apparently Diane sees him as the main force of the campaign, which is trying to push the director to accept Camille's role in the film (from Adam's side in the second half of the film) and therefore occupies a large part of his dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and regret for Camilla's murder, part of her wants him to be absent, making him a foolish criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt to totally screw up the audience because they have a false pretext to see the movie. I have to love that "something annoys me a little". Another interesting scene is the one that has two people on Twinkies who talk about how one of them has this recurring nightmare involving a man who is seen through the wall. outside the dining room where she sits. After a little conversation, they go out and continue on their way to the corner of the fence, accompanied, of course, by the excellent music of the scene. When we get to the corner, a figure like a scorched face burns out of the corner, frightening the bullshit of a man who has a nightmare. This nightmare exists only in the mind of Diana; She saw the guy in the dining room paying for the murder. In short, her circumcision is reflected in the nightmares of the poor man. Bum also means Diane is a bad party as he can witness later in the movie. The cowboy presents (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters who are always present in the Lynchian landscape - Diane only saw him at Adam's party for a short while, but like our own dreams, they can grant insignificant persons who in our dreams we almost do not know a substantial part, so it can be appreciated in its dream by an important part. During his scenes, we also have other clues that what we see is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.). Cowboy is also used as a tool to ridicule the director when he meets him in an odd place (lights here make it clear that it's part of a dream). Also, notice how he says he will appear once again if (Adam) does well or twice if he does wrong. He will appear twice more during the film, suggesting that Diane has done wrong. He is also the one who wakes her up to reality (the scene is probably an illusion that has adapted to her demands to appear twice) and commits suicide shortly thereafter. Espresso scene with Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, composer like Luigi) is probably the result of Diane having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam's party in the second half . At the same time, it could be a statement from Lynch. During the scene in which he enters Diane's apartment, the body is in Camilla's bed, but he notices how she has taken Diana's place to sleep; Diane sees herself in her own dream, but her face is not her, even though she had the same wounds on her face as Diane had after herself. This scene is also full of some true Lynchian ghosts. Since Diane didn't know where (or when) the killer would get to Camilla and finish her, she just put her in her home. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's audition for the film was bad. In his dream he brings a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew excited about her performance. Also interesting is that the money that was used in real life to pay for the murder of the Family now appears in Rita / Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's withdrawal of her horrible act by giving her money back because the murder has now not materialized. When her neighbor comes to give her a piano ashtray, another hint is given; she takes an ashtray from her table and leaves, but later when Camilla and Betty have their meeting on the couch, we see the ashtray reappear when the camera slides over the table, suggesting that Betty's meeting with the neighbor was fantasy. The phrase Adam wins is "She's a girl"; which are exactly the same words that Diane uses when he gives Camille a biography to photographers. The blue box and key are a major break in the film and they are the true truths of the characters. revealed. There is a lot of symbolism here; a box may represent the future of Diane (it's empty) or it might be a Pandora box (the hitman laughs when he asks what the key will open). Either way, it is associated with the blue key murder (which is placed next to it after the murder). The box is also visible at the end of the film in the hands of a mutilated ass. Club Silencio is a nice little add-on to further remind the viewer that it's not real. It also means that Diane is going to wake up to his reality (her reality is a nightmare that she is unable to escape, even in her dreams). During the cool scene at the end, where the haunted old couple reappears, Diane is troubled to see suicide as the only way out to escape the screams and avoid fear of fear. Anyway, it's $ 0.02. I hope that it could help people to come up in this movie and call it "the worst movie ever" or something like that without realizing the plot. As usual, Lynch is about creating irrational fears, and he certainly does this with this picture. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
