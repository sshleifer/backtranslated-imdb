BLACK WATER is a thriller that can completely overcome its limitations (it's indie flick) by constantly subverting expectations that appear as an intense experience. In the tradition of all good animal centered thrillers, ie Edge, the original Cat People, directors know that the limitations and what is not shown are the best ways to pack a punch. The performances are real and clamping, the crocodile is very well done, really if it is to be believed that the Black Water website is real because they use real crocodiles and the marsh is wonderful. If you are after B-Gore Fest Croc Romp forget about Black Water, but if you want a smart, thrilling ride that will be afraid of water and wondering what the hell I would do if I was on the tree, then they must see it.
