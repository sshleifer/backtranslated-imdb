Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a psychiatric patient who claims to be from a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him while trying to understand Prot and see if he's really from K-PAX. This movie doesn't really belong to any particular genre. One big part of K-PAX is drama / science-fiction, another part of fantasy, plus, join that comedy and get what K-PAX is about. The story (as you can see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and twists that can surprise you, just like me. No special effect or graphics to accompany this movie, and no need to have them, the music in the movie is great however. The techno soundtrack along with the amazing piano composition makes K-PAX sound science fiction and makes some scenes interesting. Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very compelling alien (Prot) from planet K-PAX, emotional with expressive facial expressions, Spacey does a great job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell who helps and tries to understand Prot. Bridges are also excellent in their part. Bridges and Spacey are well suited and should have a lot of experience. Dr. Wife Powell is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her role well, showing frustration from her husband away and so dedicated to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays Associate Dr. Powell Claudia Villars, in fact we don't see Claudia too much, but overall he's fine. K-PAX is rated as PG-13 for "sequence violent images and short language and sensuality," and it applies. As for "violent images," we don't see too much. they have enough blood on them, but that's all The language is: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "with" words, and several uses of the Lord's name in vain. just since Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction works on K-PAX, nothing terrible, just about feeling like "having your nuts in a vice." Not too bad at PG-level 13 film, it could have been a lot worse. Finally, K-PAX is not a bad movie, it won't amaze you, but it's fun and fun to watch. , and you know what I mean, it's the story of a patient with a psychiatric hospital, what do you expect? the film, all in good rent for those of you who are looking for a good drama that you can go back to and relax with. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've seen this movie already, like this, and thinking about getting a DVD, I would highly recommend it. It has a lot of extras to look through, and even an alternative end and deleted scene. 8/10
