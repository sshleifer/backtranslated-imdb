Reality Before Reality TV? Copy "Fast Times on Ridgemont High"? The predecessor of "Say Anything", which is bolder? I can't decide, but sound * is * 80's - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, And U2 - I can't believe they would never throw all these genres together in a teen movie today. I remembered it as a teenager - mainly a sexual part and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80s. When I watched it again, I just can't describe how much I love Rose, playing Kimberly Richardson, who turned out to be "Pepper Ann" in the 1990s, and she was nearly 30 when she was in Last American Virgin, playing 16 years - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry on top.
