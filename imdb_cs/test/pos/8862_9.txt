Antarctica, Winter 1982. A team at an American research base surprised a few mad Norwegians who chase a dog with a helicopter and try to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and the Americans have nothing but a dog, a few bodies and questions. This is the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. From the outset, you feel a tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone in a country without people. Ennio Morricone was nominated for the Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know, because what I see is his score simple, scary and very good. It really gets you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Acting is great! The best performance is probably given by a dog that is just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs, I can say nothing less. Maybe you think 1982 and special effects aren't the most impressive? Well, think again! You didn't see that until you saw it. Bodyparts Falling and Creating Changing Forms ... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone's special makeup effects. The film did not get much feedback when it first came across a big screen for other extraterrestrial movies at the time, and it is not very well known. In fact, you might consider it an unknown film. Nobody heard about it. However, the film has survived more than twenty years as a cult video and DVD movie. Twenty years is a long time, and apart from hairstyle, the film is still pretty much up to date. This film is to be considered classic. The film is undoubtedly one of my, if not my, favorites. I've seen it several times, but it's as good as when I first saw it. As the only Norwegian thing I don't like about this movie, MacReady is still calling Norwegians.
