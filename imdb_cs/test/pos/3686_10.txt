I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie yet. It's a really spectacular comedy (I'd say it's a farce, but it's too good and I'd hate it for quality). Studying a comic character about how the mid-life crisis unfolds, about homosexual inequalities who can't recognize their long-term unions, and about the general differences between people who don't fit in well, is the amazing effect of Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett. Forget Julie Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another film together. Anxiety-ridden, acerbic and outrageous daughter-in-law, Maudie (Meredith Eaton), is truly a wonderful character. If you liked the City Stories movie, you would like this quirky charger.
