My family really enjoyed this movie. As for what this movie will do for Rugby in the US ... so I'm sure it will be debatable. But as for me and the others around me, I know we were more curious about the sport after watching the movie and I personally gained more respect for this game. You can wonder how this is possible, especially since the film doesn't sink and explain Rugby. But the simple fact is that you are drawn into the players and emotions of the game and life. The film was both inspiring and fun. That made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah, and Sean Faris worked well. Some may think that the movie is a bit of a cliché, but I really want Hollywood to make more movies like this. I couldn't help with the analogies of play and life fights. In the end, I found myself researching my own life to see what I needed to do better to be the best person I could be. Honestly, this film was grateful for teaching morality, values ​​and teamwork, so much the opposite. After I noticed it, I hope my kids will be trained by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
