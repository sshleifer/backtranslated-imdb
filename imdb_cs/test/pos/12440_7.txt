The happiest days of your life show off some of Britain's greatest British comedy talents in traditionally farcical and higher-class twit like fashion. In general, a whistle tour of stuffy English behavior with a girl-only school provides a great environment for dotty goings-on. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - above all! - Joyce Grenfell is fantastic, giving us a lot of laughter when they express their utter horror they have to deal with. As the film moves on, things with sillier and sillier with a tour of school for parents are suitably crackers high point. At this point I'll give special mention, again, Joyce Grenfell and her beautiful character Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, apologetic and ineffective that she seems to have stolen the whole movie. He gives the greatest laughter when he flirts with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!"). While some of the movies are slow or dated, and not always very interesting, they still keep most of its sparkle and barely stop for romance. Good for silly, harmless giggling. <br/> 7/10
