You have a GOT to see this movie ... I saw it, like 13 years old, in a theater, on my first date ... Fast forward over 20 years and I'm now gay (Thanks a lot One Dark Night! LOL!). This movie made me like a kid sneaking into hell (mausoleums still do!), But as an adult, the excitement of this movie is not in the story, but rather hysterical laughter that holds ... (my personal favorite) after "turkey". Also, stick to your peeled eyes for the scene where Carol (blonde, head sister) tries to hang her phone on soda can (can't believe they didn't repeat it!) ... Other attractions include Adam West's too dramatic explosions and dead corpses. If you're a fan of real horror, I'd suggest this movie just because it's almost parody of horror for me. There is def. The Haunted Factor and Conspiracy is Good, But Don't Look At It If You Want to Be Scared of Your Wits (Unless You Are Like 10 Years or Something).
