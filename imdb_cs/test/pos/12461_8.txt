Don't let the wildly changing reviews of the movie bounce you off. You will love or hate him according to your own taste. However, if for no other reason, see "Greystoke" to experience the thrill of a great actor grabbing a heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor to master Shakespeare perfectly; rather, he is to be remembered for his sensitive handling of each character he displayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the sixth Lord Greystoke, his last performance, is to be admired by all who love theater.
