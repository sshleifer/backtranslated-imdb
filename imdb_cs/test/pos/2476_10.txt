I watched pp. I must say, I was amazed at how the real movie looked. He felt like a documentary. I also think the film has presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the Vietnam War is stepping up to the point where China is involved. What if it happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to what was shown in the movie. We already had camps in this country ... and we still do it ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for all ... especially radicals ... <br /> <br /> I said that if I was in the position that those kids were in that I just lied my ass. I love America and her great wars (winking winks)
