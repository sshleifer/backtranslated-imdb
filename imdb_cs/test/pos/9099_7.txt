For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "The Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "robbers of the lost ark," you'll find "Tenacious D: The Pick" that you like (but probably not love ). Fate, "a fictional epic about the creation of JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two out-of-work losers with the love of rock n'roll encounter a dilemma when KG's long-supporting mother stops sending him rent checks; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after the sage musician-trader (inspired by Ben Stiller) tells them about the titular selection (humorous animated-sequence tapestries gives backstory). On the way, our zeros meet a stupid stranger (Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, Stoner Guardians, Sisters and Satan himself (ironically cast by Dave Grohl), in a climactic sequence that must be seen. (and is preferably played at high volume). I rarely see a comedy in a theater, but "Pick" is a very nice change of tempo ... it doesn't have to go up to 11, but it buzzes the melody both raw and clever for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by low-eyebrows. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10
