This film is about Viola (Amanda Bynes) and her attempt to defeat her team of Cornwell boys after kicking girls. So he goes to Illaria's school of opponents and joins the boys' team and finds himself in Duke (Channing Tatum), who thinks he has a guy and likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who likes Viola as her brother. <br /> <br /> I was in version 12 of the night game and the beginning was very modern. So I knew it well. I was very abandoned when I saw this movie, and when I saw it, it exceeded my expectations. He kept a lot of my favorite lines and I saw great connections with the game. Although it was like the game was not so complicated. It was also more than I expected, but it was good. It was very funny. It attracts you to a number of crazy love stories and lies. You have seen the viola (Amanda Bynes) think badly about what people think and what are their complications in the life of men. You also see her roommate, Duke's (Channing Tatum), the impression of it. I really enjoyed seeing characters portrayed in a modern way. It also tells the modern theme "follow your dreams" but this time it has a twist. I think this movie was a great movie about a girl who loved football and stuck to herself and her family and her dreams. I think this film will be a big break for many stars.
