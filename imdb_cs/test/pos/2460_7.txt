This film easily competes with the emotional power, dramatic impact and top performances of "12 Angry Men". I rented it on a whim and I was amazed to hear about it. I don't know if it was Emilia Estevez's directorial debut, but the pace, interplay and development of characters as well as some clever camera that surrounds Estevez, all suggest a natural eye. The match between Martin and Emilia includes the same amazing chemistry we've seen on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is amazing in her fine despair and escape characters; a variation on her character in "On the Game in the Lord's Fields". It is irritating and yet empathic with it. There are times when I feel that the conspiracy slows the touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost seem to be written for another. the movie, Estevez leaves as another character together. But these are minor complaints. This film must be based on a true story or written by someone who has experienced it. I rate it 8 out of difficult 10. <br /> <br />
