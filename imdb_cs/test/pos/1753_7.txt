Hoppity is a charming, if slightly fycadelic animated film, which, given that it was made in 1941, stood the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit that I have a soft spot for 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it is called in the UK) when I watched the VHS version that our parents recorded many times with our siblings. in the morning just to catch him on the Channel Four (never less at 0615!) The movie was just as beautiful as I remembered it with the animation that stood the test of time and a beautiful moral story that would appeal to parents and children alike. Maybe one day I will share this forgotten classic with my own children. With a nice running time for kids (88 min.) And a simple but story-telling story is really something for everyone in this story about how a little boy is coming. I really saw that it was successfully redesigned in CGI. Take note of Pixar.
