Again, Kevin Spacey chooses the winner with K-PAX, a cute movie that expresses a profound revelation to human existence through the naive character of Prot, but at the same time undoubtedly a wise, point of view. It's a nice experiment to work out "if it is or not," as the plot expands, and the character of Robert Porter is fulfilling. However, some may find the end a bit unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not be otherwise. He has several problems with the film revolving around a rather caricature and through a simplified representation of mental patients. I was surprised because movies show a lot of intelligence and I don't feel that they have lost anything by being more honest about how people with mental health problems behave. I realized it was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is beautifully shot and the story melts at a pleasant pace. Bridges are great and Spacey delivers moderate and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that lets you talk to your friends.
