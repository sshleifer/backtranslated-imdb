Unfortunately, their fathers are wearing because Juliet's dad wants to take over Trome's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them and stop this dispute?

It was released in theaters in 1997 and got some good reviews on it's dark humorous satire of the legendary story that it all started, it has some good laughs, piercings, graphic violence and gore like head broken on a fire hydrant. For me, this is the third best film Troma next to the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War", which is the second, yes, that acting can be a bit bad, like some Troma flicks, but the above things do. they must see the movie if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson, and Troma, or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW is also looking for some fun performances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT.
