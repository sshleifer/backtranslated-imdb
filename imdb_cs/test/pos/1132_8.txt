I'm not a big TV man ... but when I saw the first Greek episode, I couldn't wait until next week! Don't miss the show for nothing! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU FOR THE DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... acting like a bad boy, but he's so sweet ... Everyone has his own character, so we have almost all types of people. You could still throw in Hispanic and plump people. I didn't go to school in the US so I never liked the idea of ​​frat home and so on, so when my husband told me about a show I didn't pay attention to until he asked me to look at it he watched, and because I didn't better do it, I agreed. I laughed so hard the first night that I just needed to watch it. So .. I'm with other people who voted for this show to continue! I hope for the second, third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, very funny and fun!
