It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy families and children around the world with one thing: fun. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he made a character that is as big as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! Two films were made by Mr. Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." This review will focus on the "Steamboat Willie" feature of 1928. In 1997, I rented an ancient VHS, which had a lot of old Disney cartoons on it, Mouse !!!!! Mickey Mouse !!!!! And guess what? The piece was there and I loved it !!!!! Shortly after I took the tape back, it was playing on an old Disney Channel (note: "Old" Disney Channel) early one Saturday morning. Yes, it's a big cartoon; this paved the way for more great Disney things from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, really !!!!!
