I found the movie very real as well as Saving Private Ryan and I gave the account in advance from a German perspective. Graphic action and individual characters gave this film a lot of interest in the film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle and the scenes gave this film, which is a sharp reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this film in a few years and was once again captivated by its realism. Weapons, uniforms, and German hearing while reading headlines gave great credit for a good military film. In fact, this is the German perspective of the battle, I took root for the Germans, though they were an agressor and the ultimate loser of the war.
