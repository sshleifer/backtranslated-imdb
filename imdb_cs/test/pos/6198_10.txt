I'm not sure how it might be better, so I gave it 10. Acting was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the band that played Darwyn was a smoldering, thoughtful character who showed the inner confusion he suffered (driver's death is one example). The story was believable and the length of the series was almost true (ie, I love lost, but sometimes does it end?). As a Briton I tend to think of Yanks as gung him. The LAPD was in their badly recommended attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were shown positive. My main idea about programs like this (and also excellent 24) is - could it happen? Would that happen? Is it happening now? Probably probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another series, but after reading some of the previous comments it doesn't seem to be. Summary - If you haven't seen make sure you do.
