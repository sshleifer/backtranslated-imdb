The Golden Door is the story of a journey of the Sicilian family from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, convinces his family to leave his homeland in Sicily, embark on a challenging journey through the raging sea, and inhabit a country whose rivers allegedly flow through milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World, their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The images of the New World are optimistic, smart and highly imaginative. Silver coins flee from heaven to Salvatore, predicting how it will prosper in the New World; carrots and onions twice as large as human beings are harvested to indicate wealth and health, and the rivers of milk are floated and flowing through the minds of those who expect what the New World will bring. All these images are surrealistically intertwined with characters and help nicely bow to the bold realism that the story unfolds from the audience. The contrast between this idea and the dark reality of Sicilian people helps to give hope while on board the ship to the New World. A trip to the New World is shot in almost total darkness, especially when the sea storms and almost kills people inside. The dark reality I mentioned is the Old World and the journey to the New World itself. The Old World is portrayed as somewhat abandoned and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore sneaks together to sell what a few possessions he left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to get the appropriate clothes he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed they had to adapt to some dress to be admitted to the New World; it was almost to suggest that people had to sit a particular stereotype or form to be recognized as morally fit. The strongest picture of the film was when the ship left its homeland and sailed into the New World. This image shows a glimpse of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate themselves, showing the separation between the Old and the New World. The film also suggested that people were detached from what was once known, wanted to break away from their earlier dark living conditions and wanted to enter a world that promised more. <br /> <br /> How the Later Contrasted How the New World Looks Visually, The Old World appears dark and bleak compared to the bright but foggy New World. I thought it was especially interesting that the Statue of Liberty never showed itself in the fog on Ellis, but it was hidden. I think it was a deliberate choice that apparently negated the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty means: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" as a joke with regard to what these people had to pass when they arrived in the New World. Once they arrived in America, they had to go through somewhat humiliating tests (ie, Deluding, Math, Riddle, etc.) to prove that they were suitable for the New World. These tests have completely changed the perspectives of Sicilian people. Especially Salvatore's mother had the hardest time to submit to the rules and laws of the New World, felt more violated than with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was shameful and gross. Salvatore does not change much differently than his attitude to what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually seemed to disappoint him. Most people who traveled with him shared this attitude. Their character arches deal with a much more serious dream, which is very upset, and the dark reality that has to be accepted. The film seems to comment very strongly on the preparation for entry into the heavenly and civilized society. Assumptions are purity, marriage and intelligence. Compliance with these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity. Perhaps it is a commentary on how America has learned from the failures of other nations, and has been deliberately established to ensure that these wounds are not infested and destroyed. Although the rules seemed stiff, they were there to protect and help people flourish.
