The movie was great and everything, but there were a lot of bugs in the "football" scene, I wonder if any of the guys who worked on the movie ever saw a football match before ..? First, I don't understand how she wanted to try a team of boys? in football guys and girls, you can't play in the same team and that's FIFA rules. And don't get me who it was when they found out that she was a girl who was letting her continue the game ... !! the second of all, players can't paint their faces with colors and play like that, again the FIFA rules are not mine. <br /> <br /> And don't let me start on the way they scored goals, it was ridiculously absolutely unrealistic. and all the players looked as if they didn't know Jack about football. and when the Duke trained Viola, they focused solely on filming what had happened to the passage and dribbling. or shot her only problem?! and why the hell were all the posters on the wall in their Chelsa room? they don't like any other players from other teams. it was as if it was the only team they knew ...! but other than the movie was good and I enjoyed the rest, just training and game scenes were unrealistic for me. they really should deal with them ...!
