I didn't know what to expect when I decided to follow this document. I knew it was a former Vietnamese prisoner of war in Laos who had escaped, but I knew nothing else. In fact, I didn't expect too much. What a Surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what makes this film different from other biographies is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. The dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during World War II and about the hardships. We are with him in the same small town where he describes his family, inspiration and struggles. We follow him to America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. Later, Dieter describes his story of capture, escape, and survival in the Laotian jungle. We are with him in this jungle again, as he describes and reorganizes his imprisonment and the way to freedom with great detail. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and forms of detention with which it has not really changed for 30 years. During the escape we see a dense jungle, mountain terrain and the Dieter River. It helps us to understand his emotions, pain and suffering. I enjoyed the man, the story, and the style. Well done!
