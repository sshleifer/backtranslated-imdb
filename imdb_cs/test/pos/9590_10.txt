I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I've been waiting for it on DVD. I got it on VHS and I got so much waiting for release and worrying that my copy of VHS would destroy the device to get it on DVD. The picture and sound are excellent for my total surprise. If someone else wants me to send me a copy on the line at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and put it on DVD for $ 7.00, I'll print a DVD and get him in the post. Â£ 7.00 just covers my costs and recorded supplies, etc. With maybe a little over, so I'm not after making money out of it, I'd like the world to see this ignored jewel comedy. I recently saw a copy of eBay gotten for over 26 pounds, amazing. How they can't release this classic. Write me on payment details like check or paypal etc. Etc
