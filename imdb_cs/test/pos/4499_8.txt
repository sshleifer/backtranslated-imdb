Based on Khaled Hosseini's best-selling novel, The Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and struggle for redemption. Set in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the Taliban regime, all elements are present for a great drama, but under the guidance of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks a kind of singing emotional impact that's for an unforgettable experience, even if it's fun , acted well and moved occasionally. In 1978 in Kabul filmed in Kashgar, China because of the danger in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real, even if they are miles away in social and economic conditions. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in a luxurious setting with his rich and educated father Baba, who plays the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his wealth is one of the world's poorest countries. Although Baba is a loving father, she admits to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business associate that Amir is too soft and that there is "something missing from the boy". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who takes care of his every need and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. Both are separated not only by class but also by ethnicity. Amir, a growing writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Although little is learned about their traditions or social situation, they are connected by their love of kite flying, popular sport in Kabul and Amir's reading of Afghan folk tales for illiterate Hassan. The annual kite-flying competition for boys is a big event in their lives and CGI effects are breathtaking. The dragon chains are covered with glass particles, and the winner is the one whose dragon line can lower other dragons in the sky. Hassan is a kite runner who has the unusual ability to find fallen dragons and bring them to Amir as a trophy. After Amir wins an important competition, however, a sad event occurs that will shape the rest of his life. Bullies, led by Elder Assef (Elham Ehsas) who later appears as a reckless Taliban leader, attacks Hassan because he is Hazara and brutally rapes him (off camera) while Amir is too scared to try to prevent him. Unable to face his perceived lack of courage (even if one has to wonder what if he could do something to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force behind his relationship with Hassan, and their friendship becomes tense. In one incident, Amir throws pomegranates at Hassan as if begging him to defend himself and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not take the bait, remains loyal despite his friend's cowardice. When Amir urges his father to release the servants and accuse Hassan of stealing the watch, Hassan admits theft, even if he is innocent. Eventually, the circumstances force Ali and Hassan to leave the stud. When the Russians attack Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, fleeing to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story goes on later. Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell trinkets at an open-air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), seemingly undergoing the movements of life, studies to become a writer at a local community college. After falling in love and marrying Soraya (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of General Kabul, Amir finally publishes her first novel, The Ashes Season and things look very positive. When Amir accepts the call from Rahim Khan to ask him to visit him in Pakistan and tells him that it is a way to be good again, the specter of guilt that haunts him all his life attracts Amir to go home. Returning to Pakistan and returning to Afghanistan with great risk, he now controls the Taliban to face the demons of his past and discover a surprising secret in the process. Kite Runner is a sensitive film that deals with internal pain that comes from not being true to your best instincts and allowing you to cross shame to a new level of responsibility. It also does not hide the pain caused by Afghanistan's wars and revolutions, the pain that may be represented by the suffering Hassan. Unfortunately, this reduces the complexities of good guys and criminals and distorts what has actually happened, relieving the US of dealing with anti-government secret operations in the country, from any responsibility for a catastrophic war that has left more than a million dead and millions of disabled people. Although inspired by the outstanding children's actors and moving with the freedom of dragon flying, Kite Runner gives up his power when trying to replace the melodrama history.
