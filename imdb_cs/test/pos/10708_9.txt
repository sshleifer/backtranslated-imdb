I am surprised by the questions and questions that this document has brought in reviews, especially because they are really interesting questions. Certainly those who could best address it would be the creators of the film itself. However, I think I can shed some light on something that I think has been overlooked, which in my opinion is the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it is trying to convey. What is his message? With the risk of pointing out the very obvious I will begin to say that the creators intend. They try to tell the story, make sense of it and get across. With this in mind, we can shoot down many criticized points, especially those that relate to what people expected in contrast to what the filmmakers really tried to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film isn't about it. Isn't that "enlightenment of a non-Brazilian audience" about the Brazilian favelas' problem? Who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae supported by this or them? It doesn't matter in this context. Not enough women in the movie for your taste? It is not about equality or a feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family, and all the aspects and functioning of the AfroReggae movement? Don't be so picky because it doesn't matter. There's only so much time a story can have before it can become a film anymore. If the authors were to show everyone what they were expecting, they would have to make a six-month TV series instead. If you expect it all, you are wrong with the movie. The film is actually about two individuals who started the movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who long for change. Two individuals try to do something about everything that happens around them. Individuals who went down and wanted to get up. It is all about finding the meaning of life, drawing inspiration from poverty, changing fate and becoming something other than what it is intended for - criminals and drug traffickers. It is about success and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of the film, which is what the characters are constantly surrounded by. The film ends unexpectedly and without reason with focusing much more on Anderson's progress through life difficulties. It's because they faced Anderson's accident when they were shooting a movie. I'm not sure about it, but maybe even seriously thinking about ending the shoot right there, leaving behind all the efforts. But Anderson wanted to continue. And so they did, risking losing the film with a bit of identity crisis, taking into account the sudden change of course, but getting the impression that someone was overcoming such devastating events. It is very obvious who watches that the film begins with AfroReggae and ends with Anderson. In this sense, it is very unique (moving the story line). Perhaps their only sin does not mean that it would be clear in advance, which may initially be based on expectations that will go unfulfilled. As for the importance or commonness of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the world, end all violence, feed all hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be known as Mother Teresa or anyone else known. celebrities there. It is much easier to relate and draw inspiration from someone who is, like everyone else in fact, trying to transform his own harsh life, raise problematic children, cope with permanent injuries or illnesses and even manage to pay bills by the end of the month. To understand the film you have to see, it's about leaving the past involved with drugs and crime, inventing it and trying to persuade others not to follow the same unpleasant path. While you can criticize whether the way they decide to be effective and question the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions. Also, the perception that Anderson is strange or chosen may have something to do with the fact that the filmmakers are very involved in the lives of the characters they portrayed. Just as they become friends with them. There is no way to make a whole movie with a more favorable light over Anderson. If a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, but you're doing a lot of work. And that's not necessarily bad. It's not that they treat him as "chosen", just as they go to great lengths and try to show him as a seed for transformation and a source of inspiration. Finally, do not look at this documentary for the scenes of poverty and crime that it contains, watch what is more, an inspiring story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? It seems to be damn good and professionally done to me and does not influence or dare the film's intentions. Romanticized? Speculate on his credentials as a document if you want, but why not when it is to cause a reaction and inspire you? They are not trying to make people's lives better through music and dance - the essence of what they are trying to do - to romanticize their own reality? Excuse me, but I'm pointing out what reporters are doing, and you can watch them every night on TV. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be a filmmaker, I would like my first film to be great as well.
