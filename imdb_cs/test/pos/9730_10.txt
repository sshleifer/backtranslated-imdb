This is probably one of my favorites, even though I have the first one and I have seen Curse, Legacy and Vs. The only better than this is PM vs. DT. The curse is the worst in the series than the first, and then its Legacy. I encourage people to see this and DT. Those who say it stinks so bad, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic movie that even younger children can watch, so they don't have to worry about watching others. That's my review, you can call me Gipdac, (its easy to find out where it comes: 101 Dalmatian series, you can view it at Toon Disney at 4:00 A.M.). Oh and don't laugh, I'm a guy, you'll see more of my reviews at the right time. If you want to know why I'm following it? I'm 12! Advice word: Have mental food, arrrrrooooooooooo! I also agree with you motter-1, but why people like others are because they are more exciting than horror, and because puppets look scarier. You can also call me Gipdac.
