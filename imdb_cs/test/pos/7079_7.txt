I loved this movie. To be very fair, the movie starts very slowly, with none of the characters being terribly compassionate. It continues this way for a good half of the film. However, if you are patient, you will be greatly rewarded. What is lacking in character development and / or sympathy in the first half of the film is sufficiently compensated in the second half of the year. It's a bit like a roller coaster ride - a slow climb up a hill and then a speed, turn and turn and a few surprises. Meryl Streep is, as usual, amazing. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good if he is a little woody in stains. Renee Zellweger has a very good job and shows her performance in Jerry McGuire wasn't a coincidence.
