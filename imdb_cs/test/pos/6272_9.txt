This film must be quietly released on another side of the world, possibly in English. Hopefully nobody said a word, but there is nothing to understand in this movie! Haahaa! Call me a nut, but I think it's one of the best movies ever. Why would I come to this conclusion? Because it's my national past to sabotage horrible movies and this is what every second minute tries! Once I became a fan of the Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt they would find it and use it. Sure enough! The version they received was named "Cave Dwellers" using some strange intro record, not even from the movie itself (they seemed ashamed to use shots of their own movie!). I can't say I recommend this movie to buy. Rather, I recommend getting the MST3K version. Of course we'll find it wherever MST3K DVDs are sold, don't miss it!
