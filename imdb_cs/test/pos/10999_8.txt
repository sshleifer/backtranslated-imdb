Squire Gothos is one of the "sillier" episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining ones. The entertainment factor is, generally speaking, powered by a stand-off between William Shatner and the episode of the merry visiting star, William Campbell. During an unspecified routine, Sulu suddenly disappears into the air, and Kirk follows soon after the wards. Spock immediately starts looking for his missing colleagues (and though he hates friends), while two stranded crew members have to deal with a mysterious, omnipotent, flashy Trelan (Campbell), self-proclaimed Squire. Gothos, a being able to create or destroy anything he wants through his power of his mind. At first glance it may seem that a plot from previous episodes (honestly, there are some science fiction shows) it didn't look at least one god-like character, but that feeling disappears quite quickly thanks to the scenario victory the use of exaggerated humor, all shipped through Campbell's intentionally camp performances: his Trelane is essentially a Trek version of a corrupt child in the adult body, while his ignorance-nourished curiosity for the human race (his knowledge is quite limited) probably served as an inspiration for Gene Roddenberry when he came up with the character Q for the next generation pilot, about two decades after this episode aired. In short, the key to valuing a Gothos squire is this: "stupid" does not necessarily correspond to "bad".
