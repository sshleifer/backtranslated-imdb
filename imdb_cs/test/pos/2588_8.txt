We have just seen this film before being released at the Norfolk Film Forum (VA) and there has been a general consensus on two issues: excellent performances in the top-notch drama of both leaders and others: and secondly, marketing for the subject will only bring disaster. We saw a clear poster with strings and a suggestive commentary suggesting some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. Sadly, people looking for close porn will be stretched to see the film and be disappointed because it will be too "heavy" for them, while people who really enjoy it would not be caught dead when they go to the theater . show it. Very bad. Good movie useless.
