1931 also featured "American Tragedy", the original story of "Who He Will Take with, Poor Girl or Rich Girl". it was a really funny movie. Babs Stanwyck was as nice as it could be. Monroeowsley, undoubtedly played by Babs' husband. I've never heard of it, but I thought it had a good physical resemblance to Crosby's bing of "big broadcast" ('32), even receding hairline and winged ears. Ricardo Cortez, rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true film pioneer who is coming back. the dilemma is solved at the end, to the tribes of the title and I believe that Annette hanshaw had hit the record, though the off-screen voice did very well. I also enjoyed the ballroom scenes. I'm sure they're authentic; the band, the leader of that time was excellent. good work, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
