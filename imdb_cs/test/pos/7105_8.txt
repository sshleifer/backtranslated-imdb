The last of the sequels, not counting Abbott and Costello to meet Frankenstein which was more or less a spoof. Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) also appears in the search for a cure. A good doctor succeeds in healing Larry's werewolf, but Dracula tricks the doctor and ends up contaminating his blood and making a good doctor crazy lunatic.oh and this time the great Franky (Glenn weird) is lying on a table waiting to fix the electricity some confusion. It was a short film, about 70 minutes and some change, but the action is there and great actors are there too. appears as a police inspector, heres some trivia, Lionel atwill appeared in Frankenstein's son, Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein meets with a werewolf and House of Frankenstein. And then this one.If there was another in the series they may have added creatures from the black lagoon to the line up, giving the house Dracula 8 out of 10.
