If we compare the film industry with the ocean, we tend to observe only the surface. Powered by a strong Hollywood marketing force, we've all seen war films like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. However, silence, lesser-known pearls, grow from time to time under the plastic waves. When you choose it and look at it carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is no longer on the crown. "Stalingrad" is such a gem. Why, does it have a lot of multi-million dollar rated actors? No. Does it have thousands of things? No. It has breathtaking, spectacular, shiny computer visual effects. Not at all. What's so special? In one word, it is a pure past that has been rebuilt and transferred to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything in the invasion, burned out villages, collapsed buildings, broke out suburbs, fired, fired, tanks in fire, fired soldiers, burned alive, waded tanks in pits, or cut into pieces. All. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are limited to ordinary pawn without having to change anything. The soldiers we watch in the film are trying to leave the battle zone and fail. Civilians remain in the prostate in the middle of nowhere, just crying at their children. The helpless, huge mill cylinder melts together people, equipment, villages, cities - and again and again asks for more sacrifices and destruction. In all these collective insanities, a group of German soldiers try to survive and maintain a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But as we all know, battle is almost lost when people lose confidence and faith. We see all these people being abandoned, planning the desert, trying to catch the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded) as some very bad wounded soldiers were treated like simulators and fired as they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, as they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drink - intended only for some "senior" officers. One by one they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the most beautiful, depressing and moving endings I've ever seen, all on the spectacular score of The Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in the way. This film is essential for everyone. A true movie lover should have it in his collection. A strong anti-war report must be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, humanity has never been taught, nor politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
