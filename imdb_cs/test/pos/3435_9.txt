"Skenbart" is one of the most entertaining films that comes not only from Peter Dalle, but also from the Swedish film industry itself. It's a film made in black and white to get something out of the atmosphere of the days before Christmas in December 1945, which makes it very good. Almost all the land is held on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train, there is a mixture of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics, and criticism of literature that has failed in 'Gunnar' literature, Sweden, the famous actor Gustav Hammarsten. The leading role of 'Gunnar' is the type of person who, although his intentions are for the best, seems to drag everyone who is approaching him in a very funny way, into a catastrophe and into a living hell, especially for the Finnish war, domestic, wounded soldier played extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. There is also a doctor on the train who cheats his wife with his mistress. Together, they planned to assassinate a doctor's wife who travels with the same train without knowing the intentions of her husbands. Does the doctor's wife avoid plans to murder her and all the others survive the "Gunnar" bad luck?
