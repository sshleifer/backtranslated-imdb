My first movie, Mom, I saw him on IFC a long time ago and LOVED. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and cheerful. Neither the moment in the movie disappointed me, nor bored me, and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I think this movie is really funny. But here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative - if you don't know Yuri's Mum (unfortunately, because so many of his great movies aren't here) he has a very original style like no one else and it's not even my favorite movie about him ( right now it's crazy ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). I also have to say as a Russian, this movie is great because you really see what the Russians are, and that's possible because it's a real Russian movie, NO a foreign movie, who is trying to be an American or is trying to appeal, Mom has not sold out (even since Gorko (1998) was so good, if not better. is a true Russian style of filming that came out of communist social realism. > <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a very high chance to love Mom's other movies, in fact I like a few of them I think this is his most accessible movie, a similar movie is Fou ntain, which takes place 6 years ago during the perestroika, the same actor in the lead role and more regular Mamas that you can see from the window to Paris; He has one supernatural twist at the end, but it's mostly a realistic comedy, big. Viva Mama, hopefully One Day will play all her films, she is still working and his catalog is so great! If you can, check out his movies.
