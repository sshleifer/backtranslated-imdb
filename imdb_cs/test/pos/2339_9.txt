All beginning filmmakers should watch this movie - it's like a masterpiece in digital cinema. Some scenes seem to have been taken at much higher production levels than they actually were. It is very encouraging that such a well-done work can be done on a low budget. The performances are very good and the characters are very interesting, especially the characters of the lead boy (John Kielty), who manages to play a teenager who is in trouble and is really nice. His beautiful but faded mother was also very well portrayed and the relationship between her and her boss was very interesting. It is a very unpredictable, interesting piece and I will look for anything else that the same team will do. The director is certainly one who looks at him.
