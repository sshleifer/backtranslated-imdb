I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think the part was definitely ... pretty good. The film was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. The movie also has a great event. The secret is pretty hard to come by and Rose [McGowan] does some "Oscar-worthy" acting at the end of the movie but I don't want to give up. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the movie, along with some other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mystery or action movies, or just like Rose ... I absolutely think you'd like this movie.
