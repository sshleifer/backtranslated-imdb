This is the best movie I've ever seen and I love it too much is so sad and loving I could watch this movie over and over. When I first saw the Disney Channel I was glad to see this movie again. I would like to watch this movie every day and recommend it to everyone. this is a really good movie. for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and thinks they should go and see it because it's really good. I love the part when the boy learned about the girl and I've been into this movie ever since. If I could watch two movies every day, it would be this and loved ones are my two favorite movies that I really like
