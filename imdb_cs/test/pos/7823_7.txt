This is made for the TV movie Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family-oriented. Just Desserts is a boy and a girl falls in love while working on a movie. Two bakers compete for a $ 250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. It's fun and fun. Desserts look great. The film has a catchy, optimistic little song playing during the competition. I suppose it's for Roger Bellon's movie song. The bad thing that no soundtrack is available. I really want to get a copy of the song. I don't even know the song's name because credits are silent at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. In any case, the cast is great. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very lively and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor completes good people with amazing performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has guest appearances. The film is worth watching.
