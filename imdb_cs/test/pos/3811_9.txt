Little Gus is a ten year offender. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a trip. Reaching a petal is a bit difficult for him to create a device that will help him. His goal is to win a lottery lottery card called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows when it turns into a hell trip. He runs into some characters Lynch looked like. The most memorable is the service station operator, who puts a picture on a dragon in the hope that God will see it. Later Gus gets a tattoo and eye-patch for his injured eye. It will become one of the most rebellious 10-year-old bad-asss you can ever see on the screen. This is not a boy! Check out portraits of Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Being warned, even if Drew is on the front cover, appears in the movie only in a dream for a few seconds. Also, the film is confusing at the end to David Lynch, you may want to watch it several times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss" scenarios.
