The director and co-founder Alejandro Amenabar did not make the audience his tense, somewhat too long but very disturbing story easy, precisely based on the Spanish man's attempt to get assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is grasping and its impact far exceeds the time spent in the theater. With the acclaimed Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasion", people have come to see the family along with coterie dedicated friends to address the wishes of a loved one, even a myriad of people, to end their lives. In the film, the progressive, incurable cancer suffered from the center of attention, and its descent to the terminal stage was rapid. Emotional in scenes, death was inevitable - the question was how gentle it could be done through demand intervention. Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is another story. For more than two decades he was quadriplegic due to a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers can reveal the horrible irony of why he ended up in this state because of his improvised dive.) Once a world traveler and a lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in a motionless body, his truly dedicated family attending all his needs and giving up most of your privacy and time to maintain your beloved relationship. Rosa (Lola Duenas), the single mother of two little boys, enters Sampedro's home from what might be merely a curiosity to learn about the paralyzed state of man, but she becomes both an emotionally supportive center of Ramona, such an entertaining but sometimes aggravating presence. Nice performance Duenas. The problem is, of course, that Sampedro is not ill in the normal sense. He can live with due care for decades. So his gently but steadily expressed desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives who, surprisingly, do not respond to different ethical and religious aspects. a group dedicated to changes in Spanish law on assisted suicide. "Death with dignity" is their motto. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who receives support for bono publico counsel, Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that carry a vague but catastrophic prognosis. Luckily, she married a devoted husband and merged emotionally with her client. What follows is an acutely sensitive interplay of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophile son, not intellectual Ramon, and his old father, who cannot stop mourning his son's cataclysmic descent into absolute helplessness. Moral and legal issues are played through excellent acting and short vignettes, including a courtroom scene in which formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that might take into account Ramon's feelings and opinions. It can be Spain, but the problems are alive in most countries, including the US. Especially fun is the screaming, the first floor to the bedroom, the debate between Ramon and the band, the lecturing of the Jesuit priest, also the quadriplegic, but one whose hidebound dogma carelessly masks the absence of the soul. Special Way to Mabel River, Ramon's sister-in-law-Manuel, for the noble authentic portrayal of a strong woman holding the family together. Belen Rueda, Julia, who is trying to defend an objective advocate for a close friend to a woman who moves toward a dark fate, is equally complimented. your feelings effectively and occasionally even moving. Like Dead Man Walking, this movie can support any view of its deadly subject. No one can prevent a person from committing suicide if he is determined, but the universal tragedy of Ramon's world is that without help, life in the body, in which only the heart beats and only the head can move, is a sentence that no court can pronounce on the most vulnerable criminals. Cinematography is well adapted to the story, and the beautiful Galician scenes are the intended contrast to the limited views that once experienced Ramon's experiences from his special bed. 9/10
