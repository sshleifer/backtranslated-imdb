Rififi is a great movie that is overlooked. It is a criminal drama where one gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an overused story, but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects to the job. This film looks at how the family falls apart as time goes on. The real scene heist is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of a thrilling soundtrack, the director decided to go with silence around thirty minutes of silence. It fits perfectly into the mood and is often copied these days. Of course things will get out of hand and people will die and end up in a great conclusion that builds up in tension. So if you're looking for a great movie noir that many people don't talk about, it's a great pick up.
