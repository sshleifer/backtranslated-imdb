The NYT Review says that Sigourney Weaver's character is tense and frustrated, and later that she could be the sister of the MTM character in common people. Say, what? In any case. The lady was unpredictable from the beginning. Nothing like MTM in ordinary people. Sorry. NYT further says that Sandour Travis and Jeff Daniel Ben Travis are forty-year-olds, "kids of the 1960s." Mrs. Weaver has to dance the product. I believe she was 55 when she made Imaginary Heroes. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NYT perceived correction aside, it was a pretty good movie considering that it was someone so young. Of course, Sigourney Weaver thought it, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man playing Tim was excellent. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments I could make about the script. So that I never felt good about why Sandy Travis missed his son. Her kind of blown-off behavior may have been triggered by his death, but such behavior took Â¾ of the way through a movie that I had more in common with her stagnant marriage, her relationship with Tim and where he came from, and others. unresolved questions than any sadness of her older son. Ben's grief was much clearer. So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did his mom mean that? Very attentive film. The clearer and clearer is that there are no roles for women at a certain age, rather than what he needs is a director like the one to be so clearly in love with an older woman (Mrs. Weaver) and almost make his movie pay homage to her . Kind of anti-Woody Allen.
