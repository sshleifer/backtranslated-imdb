The film is undoubtedly a powerful medium, more than ever, thanks to the availability of DVD / video, giving filmmakers the certainty that millions of people will see their story or message. The use of this medium therefore attaches innate responsibility to the artist, as film can be both educational and entertaining, requiring certain subjects to be treated appropriately and with appropriate sensitivity and sensitivity. The film, such as Spielberg's "Schindler's List", is important because it keeps a lively memory of what we must not forget, and as history repeats, Spielberg's film can be considered a valuable tool in preventing the recurrence of this tragedy. In the same vein, this film, "Focus", driven by Neal Slavin, is important, illuminating the problematic reality of anti-Semitism that has affected millions of people for many years outside the world, today is still unimaginably prevalent and so on. any sign of bigotry will be maintained if left unchecked or ignored. Born from a xenophobic strain, it is a disease infecting society that can be unlimited. and it is a pervasive look, this film is an effective vaccine that can at least help to stop it spreading, and hopefully it can act as a step towards eradicating it. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) has served his country in the Great War and has since lived in New York a quiet, conventional life. He had the same job as a HR Director for about twenty years and his own home, located in the average middle-class neighborhood he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is a kind of guy who gets okay by earning his own business and refusing to engage in matters that are not (feeling) his concern. Everything he is about to change, however, as with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the corner market owner, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), inexplicably discovered that he was the target of neighborhood xenophobes who Union with the Crusaders of the Union. a national organization that is currently being led to direct its fears and hatred towards Jews, or anyone who even looks like a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence discovers that he can no longer stand by and watch the game being played; Because now, it's a game, whether it wants to be or not. Working from an intelligent, well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles who adapted Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin is a chilling scenario that thoroughly examines the effects of bigotry on those against whom it is balanced; and taking into account the fact that it is not merely a hypothetical situation but a depiction of reality, it becomes even more worrying, even worrying. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's clear understanding of his subject and his studied presentation, which is provocative in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's "character" and very soon thereafter reaffirms him in another scene that gives the viewer the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind actually works; the thought processes that govern his life. With that in place, Slavin is able to take his audience along with Lawrence as his problems gradually begin to develop. In this way, he effectively illustrates how this problem evolves, rather than pointing out and solving the problem, which increases the emotional involvement of the audience and ultimately increases the impact of the film. Slavin made an important statement with this film, which is not just a charge of fanaticism but a warning sign of apathy. And to his credit you never come across your head, nor will he be interested in subjective pointing fingers to make his case; instead, he proceeds cautiously, with great pain, to be as objective as possible with everything he presents for your consideration. His approach is a film diplomat; And it's an approach that serves Slavin - and his film - pretty well. As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best actors in the industry - gives amazing performance, credibility and credibility to his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective image. He never tries to circumvent the personal mistakes of Lawrence's nature, but uses them instead to create a character that is definitely three-dimensional, which not only convinces him, but also serves to reconfirm the image's integrity. This is the convincing ability of Macy to express a process by which he examines his own conscience, allowing the viewer to participate in the experience of his personal revelation. In the final analysis, it's the power of Macy's performance, more than anything else, making this movie so different. Another of the film's strengths is Laura Dern's performance, such as Gertrude Hart, an image that effectively complements Macy's work, as well as her work. Dern lends her immense substance, capturing her physically and emotionally, and her varied zeal brings a remarkable contrast to the Lawrence Reserve, which works very well for her character and the film itself. And just as Sean Combs recently (in "Monster's Ball") made a good case against rejecting the actor's pursuit of an established rock star, "Meat Loaf Aday is giving strong performance like the next Fred, Lawrence's next-neighbor It also shows that the real artist will produce, regardless of the kind of screen he is given to work. Supportive cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt), a film that makes filmmakers proud of their craft, "Focus," offers an unforgettable experience that hopefully will prove instructive even to those who don't realize that such conditions exist and they still do it - even in this country free. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
