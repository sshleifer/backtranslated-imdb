Like some other people I wrote, I am a fan of hard maria and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a little boring, but believe me, it's worth it. Once you start, your addict! The levels are fun and abandoning. They'll hang you until your mind turns into porridge. I am not joking. This game is also managed and is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free, I need to keep my mouth shut for details. But try this game! It's worth it!
