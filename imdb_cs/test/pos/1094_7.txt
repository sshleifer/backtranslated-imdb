One should not be too critical of the other director. <br /> <br /> I really like working with Madiby's camera. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way to look at things. However, as a 14-year-old boy seems to be shooting such beautiful pictures? Remember, he has no education of any kind. I don't think English is the language in Cape Town ghettos. Worse yet, Madiba looks even smaller than his expected age of 14 years. Any way, if you overcome the above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the movie and still enjoy it because it is a camera work.
