I saw it last night at Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I've never heard of it before, and I was quite surprised to find it so engrossing. Bogart makes a star as a cyber editor who reluctantly walks with his greedy radio boss this incisive programmer "B". About 12 years before playing a similar cystic method to perfection in films such as the US Deadline, Knock On Any Door, Barefoot Contessa and Harder Fall Fall, Bogie already had stellar qualities on the pat. In order to increase ratings and bring their somewhat highly readable programming to the more popular level, the WUBC, "Voice of America", pushes the mini-series radio on a woman who was freed 20 years ago. pleading for self-defense killing your husband. Not willing to be discreet to save the reputation of a woman and her husband, the station uses unwavering methods to reveal all listeners and as detailed as possible. As a time capsule I also found in the mid-thirties of the 20th century greatly illuminated male and female morals in the workplace. Though unknown to Henry O'Neill, with unknown support, the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was tense. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie ever (eg A Face In The Crowd, Call Inspector, etc.), don't miss the opportunity to see this. <br /> <br />
