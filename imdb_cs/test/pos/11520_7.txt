Take away all the parts of the movie that were "present" and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have a great story. Will and Wolf's story and their relationship were the best. Diaz and Eccleston were amazing. Brewster was nervous to sit down. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as a mom. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as a father, always like him (Sleeps with the enemy). This is very hippie, save the world, kind of movie. Don't worry too much, but I suggest I see it only for Diaz's performance. It has an excellent range and should be used more. As always, Eccleston is convincing. He is amazing!
