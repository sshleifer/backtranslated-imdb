This movie is really fun, a good clean funny movie, for kids. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon Talented Amanda) is a sidekick to an unbearable boy who has a hard time telling the truth. He eventually works on a film script that is stolen. I won't bore you with details. If you have kids and want to see a fun, if not exciting kids movie, I recommend this one.
