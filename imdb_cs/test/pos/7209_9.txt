It is the story of three brothers who were in the midst of hardship and loss and learned that important things in life were family, love, trust and forgiveness. Throughout the cast, we managed to pull out strong performance despite a few lousy single-line lines. Great movie for fans of faithful life problems falling on credible families. Also worth a look at fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. They both do amazing work, often bring you to tears. Take it for a word and rent it today!
