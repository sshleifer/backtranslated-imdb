I love the assumption, but its value is only for certain parts (of course the opening scene). Some characters are a little bit outrageous, but they're fun. I think it was Ballping sh-t. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey lived in LA in Faule and showed why Casey had left the lifestyle, I just think the flashback story could have been better. Also, the Jamaican guy who knocks on the phone is smart and funny, but I think the story was still sloppy. It's really incredible. In fact, I believe Swordfish (another movie that Woods wrote) on Thursday more than some parts because the government keeps the secrets and organizations that the public will never know. Thursday is the best Quentinesque movie I've ever seen. I think Woods is imaginative, smart and witt; however, his work needs more maturation even to get to the Natural Born Killer script (not Stone's film) level. How old is he?
