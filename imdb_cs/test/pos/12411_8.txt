This "TFTD" episode of season one named ironically "Answer Me" is a pretty well done and unforgettable episode, and it takes a shocking twist at the end. You are Jean Marsh like a hill and washed an actress from L.A., who moved to New York to audition and lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Surprisingly, every night she is still awake by the ringing telephone from the next apartment, but strangely enough, enough dwellings where the ringing telephone rings is unoccupied because guests have been dead for many years. Finally he must give only she should follow along and not answer the phone with anyone at home because it is wrong to wrap up the phone with life it's own! Overall, a good episode is strange, though it's still thrilling about the supernatural phone and spinning at the end.
