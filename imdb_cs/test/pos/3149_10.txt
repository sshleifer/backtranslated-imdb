The reader is extremely well done and very sweet. Each element of the piece helps to trigger a pure emotional response to the script. He acted, directed, shot, and written well. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal or reading before filming. The performances are evidence of a subtle instinctive action in response to a well-written script. The work of the actresses was excellent and there was never a hint that their work slipped into a purely sentimental one. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors and filmmakers.
