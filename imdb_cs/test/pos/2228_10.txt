I remember seeing this movie in my late age or early twenties on television - probably HBO. I watched it with my parents, my brother and some friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I don't remember a lot of stories. I remember a whole group of us agreed that it was the funniest movie we've ever seen. When it was over, our belly was hurt from so many laughs. My dad worked in the hospital, so it was all the better. Every time I see The Party on TV, I'm trying to find out if it's there too. It is never my dismay. Even though I loved the Party, I feel it's fun. Peter Sellers was great as a crooked hospital administrator. Why it has never been posted on the video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but no one below 35 or 40 seems to have seen it. I'd buy it in a second if it was ever released to DVD.
