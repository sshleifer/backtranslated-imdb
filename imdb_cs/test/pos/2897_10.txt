This DVD will be processed with the indifference of mllions of classic rock devotees around the world because Rush just isn't cool. It is a pity that Rush had to overcome obeying the contempt of most North American and British music journalists during their thirty-year history, as many people have lost the chance to get into a real band. is well represented here and what is the song catalog! We have the semi-finals "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer", which are scattered by high-energy, genre-demanding pieces from their latest album "Vapor Trails". Music is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and Brazilian fans are just crazy (singing together with the instrumental in one place!) Every member of the band plays at a level that defies the faith of real art craftsmen. this to try the instrumentals "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size-and yes, the latter is a drum solo (which must be seen to be believed.) <br /> <br /> The production of sound and image values ​​are very high As it fits for Rush experience and also get documentary and multi-angled sets of pieces to the shoe. <br /> <br /> This is a stunning performance and tribute to Canadian rockers, and all serious classic rock fans should have their own copy.
