The word Ghilli actually means a small, sharp wooden game tool that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (ancestor of cricket) in India. Using the word as a nickname for the main character is stylish because that means the one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbing in the wrong way. Ghilli is one of the best films for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never raises for a moment and always keeps you in some exciting action. The film takes place in Madurai and Chennai and its storyline is simple. A rich landlord tries to pull a beautiful girl in his city and his undeniable power and authority prevents the girl from seeking justice. The hero tries to save her, and most of this film captures the week in which this action takes place. Very exciting movie and although the story is nothing new, the director and actors praise the event.
