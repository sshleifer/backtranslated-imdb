This hard-to-see image at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It's an amazing and loving look at Harry Nilsson, who uses many famous faces to sit on interviews, rarely seeing Nilsson's TV show and backstage footage at work. There are also a few shots from "Son Of Dracula". This film is the ultimate and appropriate tribute to one of the best voices, the smartest composer and most entertaining person in popular music. It is a crime that the name of this man is not as well known as some of the songs he has written and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hull with the subconscious wish of self-destruction. As a bonus, you can even play Eric Idle with a song that was written for Nilsson's final album during the closing titles. It's funny, it's sad. It's not in the general version. If this image plays anywhere near where you live, look!
