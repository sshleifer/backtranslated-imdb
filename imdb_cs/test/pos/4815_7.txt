*** SPOILERS *** A well-designed and interesting film about America's alienated youth in the 1950s. By that time, many parents had made the big money and lived high on the pig forgotting that their children, especially teenagers, needed much more than a car and a hefty allowance to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention to their growing problems, which is what 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur has never received since his successful film producer Father Mr. Tom Ditmar, James Daly. Never Really a connection with his father Hal grows more and more from him and his caring mom Helena Ditmar, Kim Hunter and the company. After his father gave Hal down about him wanting to borrow his car, the late model luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drive in defeated Hal's and barley opera thirties jalopy on the local treater to catch the last Western movie. Feeling like you're peeking out in the world Hal acts like a real first-class blockbuster who keeps stinking his feet almost in the face of a couple, Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett, who is sitting in front of him and Jerry is trying to watch film. This is what Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, are leading to not only being thrown out of the theater, but also to belting the theater manager Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater without even giving him back the money, but when Grebbs was trying to catch him, Hal turned around him and turned it right into the kiss. Real hot water, he is charged with attack and battery, put them on his "James Dean" act, at a local police station, so as he is either too cool or just so stupid to realize what he did; almost knocked Mr. Grebbs' teeth. It's when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobs on what he did. The rest of the movie Hal tries to try to cope with, but he is unable to do it because of the low respect his father has. He begged his father to understand that what he was doing, in Mr. Grebbs' pair, was in defense of Hal's father, acting like he was in the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son, Hal, acting like a streetman Thief instead of a young man who is grabbed and pushed without provocation. Not refusing to do what Hal did when he explained Mr. Grebbs was actually willing to admit his hooligan behavior, but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad at least treated him with respect; Gebbs, in fact, provoking Hal and Mr. Ditmas that they didn't even bother to hear him! The feeling as if he wanted a criminal without anyone, but his mom was losing too much, only to have Sgt later. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to drop the offensive attack. Do you think that Hal's lesson has finally been learned, but a real lesson, more than a section behind bars, that Hal is so desperately needed was a lesson that his father completely ignored! To be there when his son needed him most, and that Mr. Ditmar had failed with flying colors. Things actually come to terms with everyone in the film after Mr. Grebbs goes down, ends up with a stick, again Hal, returning to Grebbs Theater, trying to get him to call his Father and told him that Hal was only defending himself when he wrapped it up for the first time, not the second time. Finally, Hal learned a real lesson on how to get to people and not let his problems become problems for other nations. But most of Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most precious lesson of all how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father to him instead of a combined prison and a sugar father. Like the song he says, "All you need with love" to get things right, and that was both love and understanding for his son Hal, that Mr. Ditmar missed the most until the very end of the movie.
