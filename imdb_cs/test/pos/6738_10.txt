One of my favorite movies. Great cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious dramatic situations with brilliant comic strikes. Accurate mixture of character and story. Real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with every family member. Sensitively ranges from slightly sad to cheerful-funny. Read quotes. This is the best adaptation of Neil Simon's game. If you want to see more Eugene Checks, Biloxi Blues (playing Matthew Broderick, who played in both versions) is fine, a little on the dark side. Get away from Broadway Bound.
