This is the case when the scenario plays with viewers in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969 when a young girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her friend Wolf (Christopher Ecclestone), but dies under mysterious circumstances. Then in 1976 sister Faith Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) decided to travel to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France, he seeks out Wolf, who has stayed there, and wants him to help her return to the stairs her sister took and answer a few questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he fills the gaps of the events and tells Phoebe that Faith has teamed up with the Red Army, an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf deal with romance, which complicates the journey to Portugal, where faith died. There are a few things wrong with this movie and all this is related to the script. First of all, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is bad and he doesn't do anything for the story. It rings completely false and comes across as forced. It seems strange that Wolf engages in romance with his dead friend's sister. Second, Wolf knows exactly what happened to the faith, but only every 15 minutes he launches small pieces of information. Wolf looks at Phoebe every 15 minutes and says, "I didn't tell you anything!" Gee, thanks a lot to Wolf! If the wolf first came with Phoebe, then the movie would be in 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I didn't think this movie would restore the 1960s. Diaz wore hippie clothes, but the time period wasn't true. I enjoyed a few things like the authentic places where the movie was taken. It's a very good looking movie and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are especially good for Brewster and Diaz. Besides "The Fast and the Furious", I've never seen Brewster in anything. But after watching her performance in this movie I came very impressed. She is very good here and I hope she gets better roles. The script is narrated in a very fancy way, and the film never appears to be credible.
