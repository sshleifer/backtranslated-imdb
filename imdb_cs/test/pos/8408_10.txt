I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The film had many different places in it. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized that Rhett couldn't love her. And when Scarlett and Ann and Ann apologize for having married Rhett and Scarlett, they told her she wouldn't be afraid of getting him back. It had a great story. You can't compare it to GWTW. He just has so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT and GWTW! Of course, don't forget to have the hankie at hand.
