Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers' Party," which of course we all know as the Nazis, in 1933 increasingly strengthened their power on earth. Soon in their gross pedaling of German people, they called some and all artists, newspaper men and filmmakers into their Nazi headquarters, so that it could be informed about just what the newly declared "Third Reich" (aka 'Empire') \ t . When a director of the German Impressionist and Expressionist era of German cinematography, he was called by Mr. Fritz Lang to meet Mr. Goebels; he listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the propaganda office, Mr. Lang went directly to the train station and took the passenger directly to Paris. Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least many years later. He stayed in France, eventually emigrated to the United States. MR. LANG went to work correctly in America, creating the most enjoyable, solid and basically literate films with a higher level of echelon for many years.Included in this smörgåsbord titles is today's happiness theme, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941). The number of casts, WESTERN UNION has qualified for both requirements to get it great, as well as the accompanying cast that has been done as a great talent, doing just about every minute and every pleasure scene for our senses. <br /> <br / > HEADING up playbill are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore, others prominently featured are people like John Carradine (playing not a vampire or another scary guy, but doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and Keystone graduate comedy Mack Sennett), Chill Wills (always a reliable support player and former singer in "The Avalon Boys") and a stormy evil guy Barton MacLane. We added names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard Gate). PROMINENT in these American Indians are: Major Big Tree, Major Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. Also featured that one great representative of the indigenous peoples of North America is a brilliant, remarkably impressive and unforgettable example of Red Man, Louisiana native, Iron Eyes Cody (born Esper DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> <Br /> Filming of fine outdoor scenes has been done on site in Arizona and Utah and portrayed in the highest level of Technigolour. (There is no Monument Valley, but then it is Mr. Ford Ford's province.) In some respects, this film is a much more amazing success than we might think; Because it took some sort of magazine magazine story, it adapted to the tastes and idioms of pre-war America in the late 1930s and early 1940s. All this was done by a German director who was only in Hollywood and America for the shortest time. In his final analysis, WESTERN UNION, although it may not be the historically most accurate example of the Western genre; we just don't care. Score in all the necessary categories needed for a great night in movies! SO, who really cares about small details like "accuracy"? We give Mr. Lang and 20th Century Fox a **** rating! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We've just seen a special at the WTTW PBS Station, here in Chicago it was all about all the movie actors, directors and other craftsmen that the Nazis resurrected to power to resort to America and Hollywood. (People and Scientists seem to have been the biggest export for Germany at this particular time; it's because scientists who built an atomic bomb, as well as future NASA people, came from Europe at this time.) <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
