Brilliant actors and great picture !! I love the helicopter scene with music at the beginning, it's just as touching and real but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe that this kind of show has terrible human beings that can act under certain circumstances. Modern war films spend so much money on effects. This is just a straightforward smart movie that takes you away from your imagination. A film that really portrays evil and hatred mixed in fear and fate. How insane is the world and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. Must see the movie and without a doubt the best war movie ever! Many have tried to copy, but there are still no movies as good as this !!
