Crackerjack is a hit and miss film based in the Australian Suburban Lawn Club Cityside Bowl. Mick Molloy plays a scammer who scored in the car park at Cityside. When the club is pressured to install poker machines on its premises, it has to raise $ 8,000 to avoid it. The club needs new members to help, and this is where Mick Molloys's character comes up and must bowl to save the club. With many and coming and aging Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned, though most jokes are for those who have knowledge of lawn bowls, but there are many fun gags that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, the movie should be recommended for people who play on the lawn or play, but there is enough other material for a fun game if you have a slight understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you play at the bowling alley and go out to the theater because it is the premier grass lawn of the year (also the only one).
