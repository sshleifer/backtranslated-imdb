Everywhere I heard that people are calling this show wrong because her assumption is too far attracted .... well maybe do-good taxi driver in Philly it pushes a bit (at least taxi drivers ive met) but that's what she does. show great. The fact that this show is a bit out of reality track is a problem, but it's still enjoyable and fun. Its very guarded and although he knows Mike wins in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. His accompanying cast is great and I must say that the location of the exhibition is especially great! All in all, I watch this show not because I was looking for a good deal of reality or a show with lots of events, I watch this show because it has a great performance, a good premise and a great story every week. It is also a plus when I can select the landmarks they control or know where they are. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show!
