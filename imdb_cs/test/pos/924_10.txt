I believe I share the same psychological view of the world with Kieslowski. It is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not metaphysical amid a total coincidence. Barely ruled by a man or perhaps a poet-prime minister, as a social and cultural "low-pressure region", Poland could play the role it played in World War II to be critical, yet Christian towards Jews, but often not less critical of themselves. Kieslowski's world view has innocence and guilt, like symbols in Catholicism: White versus Black Madonna. In Rouge, Black Madonna is the one she fell in love with when he was a young man. The shots are magically-realistically intertwined with the present, albeit exactly the same as the camera simply swinging across the street, or the young rider of the red rider who passes a young woman's car after accidentally hitting his dog. The fact that we skipped over time in the same camera movements is what we understand later. His love was unanswered, so his life wasn't what he planned. He lost the ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels he is actually spying on the lives of other people 'and when he leaves, he just goes on to do so, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of justice of a younger woman (literally), who accidentally got into his life, renews his better judgment and thanks to her that he spontaneously acknowledges his espionage behavior to his neighbors and police, accepts and even holds on to his hand. As a result, stones threw his windows. In this process, history is repeated between this man and the woman he loves, though this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski could struggle with this bit for an old judge's alter ego, and it is said that he was infatuated by Ir√®ne Jacob. Both women play the same basic role in their psychology, one (!), Who has her heart and soul and therefore can make or break him, even as an old man! It is as if the "powers in the air" were, or God unites them. Accidents are also * random, just by chance or even luck. There must be some mystical, supernatural, or theological source that affects these extremely profound life choices. The study book fell on the exam questions page. Or when the old judge spoke his heart to a young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open door and breaks the windows. The huge picture of a young woman predicts the one on TV after an accident drowned on the canal. These moments are effectively emphasized by the human voice of the liturgy or what it sounds (Van den Budenmayer).
