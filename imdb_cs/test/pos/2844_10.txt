In September 2000, I saw twice 'betty sister' on international film films "by the sea" in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I was smiling all day when I watched it for the first time and almost the whole evening when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'betty sister' was simply that Renee Zellweger will play a girl in love with a star of soap opera. But what I saw was much more! Wonderful roles for Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and Renee Zellweger. Strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for all the stories that take other directions every moment you think you're on the track. Many lovers of soap opera will love "sister betty" - film and character !!! - But they can bring all non-soap friends there because they will have a story even more for hard and funny lines - freeman and rock - for cruel scenes, thriller-aspects and for beautiful pictures. And I'm sure everyone will love 'sister betty' at the end for her captivating and innocent charm !!!
