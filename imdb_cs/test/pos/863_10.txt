When I first saw Stella in a comedy center, I thought "God, that's terrible!" But I loved the Wet Hot American Summer. I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing I could do, but looking for Stella's shorts I heard contained more dildos than any other comedy. When I found them not only did I meet my expectations, but I probably found the biggest comedy scenes I saw in years. A set of twenty strange short films put me on the edge of the seat and the water ran down my feet. Not only did I laugh for the first time when I watched them, but I kept laughing as I watched them again and again. It's really a pity Comedy Central had a limitation on cable TV for the Stella series. It would be much better on HBO or Showtime. Their brand of humor cannot be limited by censors or popular culture. Given that although it was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would vote for its cancellation in the season or less, but it would be fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her individual members. Every Stella fan should look at David Wain's site with all his short films. Like Stella herself. So my hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they've created with Stella. I hope to see much more in the future.
