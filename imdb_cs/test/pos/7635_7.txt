L'OSSESSA, also known as TORMENTED or SEXORCIST, or absurdly called THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST that contains one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes to life. This great scary scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great FX). It is a pity that the rest of the film does not maintain the level of haunting that has been documented during this scene. This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. Imagine that the producers decide to make a copy of EXORCIST, but at the same time they can create something truly original (an obsessed sculpture of a crucified man who is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forgets his original idea of ​​making a boring and uninspired EXORCIST. If the film continued with the concept of the statue (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this film would shake. But once the girl becomes obsessed with the spirit of the statue, she never tells anyone where the demon came from. She and the script completely forgot the haunted cross that is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like the so-called "Euro-cult" movies, unlike other Euro-cults, it will deliver movies for the first 45 minutes. But after the scene where the girl has a crucifixion vision and gets a stigmatas, the remaining 45 minutes of SUCK. Boring. It's not fast as he's trying to emulate (wrong) EXORCIST. So watch L'OSSESSA for the first 45 minutes and enjoy the 1970s, sleaze and amazing scene with a live-live-girl-girl sculpture, but after the first 45 minutes, press the stop and eject button anyway and go to your nails.
