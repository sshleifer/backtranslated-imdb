The story itself is a routine: The boy runs away from home and ends up in a kids' musical music school. She convinces the famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a shot of shooting over 11 weeks, leaving a lot of fun holes that an attentive viewer can find for himself. However, as long as the plot bears, the film is justified by its music and acting. There is a lot of music that includes the classical works of Heifetz and The Meremblum Orchestra, one of the leading youth symphonies of the day, and the music is excellent. In itself, this would result in the image being displayed. Conducting and scoring duties were given to the best hands: Alfred Neumann. Acting is a contrast study. Children in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, had to direct director Archie Mayo insanely, looking at the camera, overcoming the parts they had, and exaggeratingly following the instructions given to them. But the spontaneity that results from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture. Veteran actors were amazing with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly cast in the role he imitated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds are perfect for their parts. And the supportive gaming was a real one, who is the character's actor's character: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins, and Porter Hall in their typical heavy role - all ideally cast. And bit players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, gravel voiced by Lee Phelps in his usual role as a police officer and many others. If you're a fan of actors, this movie will bring back a lot of memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is very enjoyable and is recommended even if you are not a classical music fan. <br /> <br /> tvcat
