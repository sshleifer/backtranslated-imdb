I was very surprised to find out that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. He seemed to be very lifeless and completely raised by the Bergman Year (54!) In the scenes where they are next to each other. If it were written today, I think that Bergman and the young man Ivan would be eliminated together (Ingrid is so much warmer than Goldie ...) and the two self-absorbing characters playing Matthau and Hawn would be left out. winter. But it was written in the late 60s and feels like a Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the park. However, Matthau's monolayer, Hawn's innocence, and Bergman's classy show make it quite pleasant.
