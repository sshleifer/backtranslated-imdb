This film could be compared to "food comfort" for the soul. Anyone who tried to save the relationship could relate to this movie. So many of his parts are so cheerful and so many parts are so heartbreaking truth. It's not perfect in its production or even in its dialogue, but the story is unique, which says a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is, at best, insignificant, but in my opinion, Heather Graham does an extraordinary job. Try it out - despite the advanced DVD case. Joline's position brings many problems in our self-service culture. He asks us if the commitment is really for the other person or for yourself. Indeed, we are alone. Watching promises (anywhere from marriage to friendship) is a great feeling. Our word is nothing but a smudge of smoke. Joline is like a wake-up call. We must be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we must not commit someone who is not able to do the same.
