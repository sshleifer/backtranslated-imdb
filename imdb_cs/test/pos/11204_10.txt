When I first saw the poster, I was impressed by its calmness and beauty. Since then, the city in Istanbul has been frightened. There is not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as complicated and aesthetically as a statue. It is a landscape itself. In fact, there are a lot of things going on in the film, but the director deliberately missed most of the dramatic parts and left them on our imagination, creating a really flat life. One can see Mahmut ladyla crying on the toilet and then go out without a word but not their fight; we see Mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital, but not her fight against the disease. The most dramatic scene in the movie is that Yusuf laughed out loud for a soldier he'd bought for his niece, and that's when he almost broke his heart to see this boring, lonely life. With all the trivialities in the life that broke out, the story is a pure inner world of all characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regret ... And as the story unfolds, I finally understand their desperate situation when their emotions did not really go out unless they touched any outside things, which is exactly who is trying to keep it at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I've just finished my second tracking. Last night I crouched in a blanket, had a vodka beside my bed and went through the film in a trance. I felt two real lives, one off screen, one inside the screen. I felt liberated from all those loneliness and anxiety, because the people inside are experiencing it. I just got rid of all that stuff. We cannot deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness puts us far away, and this becomes a cruel spiral. I bet Mahmut couldn't find a way of life at the end. That is why he came out of his room to try to find answers from the outside world, coldness and landscape.
