Romuald et Juliette is one of those French romantic comedies where they seem to violate all the rules, more like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The beautiful Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to collapse around his ears. The film is not a prophetic moral story, but an amazing story that will keep you up to date. Firmine Richard (as Juliette) is a heroic woman that delights - her laughter is my lasting memory of this warm and witty movie. The way down to the country he has to include all his children with his various fathers - especially birthdays - gives the film an advantage that raises it above your average romantic comedy. But it's always French, which shows us how easy it is!
