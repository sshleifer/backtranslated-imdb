First let me review the movie. This film creeps me and I don't even believe in aliens! However, the film has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> There are three acts to this film. Act One is perfect. Sets the film and actually creates a creep factor. I must say the score is great! Everything is set and is set perfectly. Act Two Begins When Jillian, Playing Sherry Burton, Goes Down. They hypnotize her and recall the kidnapping. Act Two destroys the film when the aliens appear. "Screaming Mad George" made effects for aliens. I must say they did a good job, except for the "gray" aliens. No offense, but Grays looked like an inflatable price door. On the side note, I liked how to treat hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you paid attention, you would notice that your husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband's version of the events, the blue light is written and his wife says, "Someone's here," or something like that. That makes sense. My husband is interested in his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his problem. But in his version of events he says, "Help me!" He doesn't say "Someone's here." It also makes sense. The aliens are after her. Her wife wants her to help her and save her. Now back to the movie. The Law Three turns the film into a gore fest. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound. It's a typical gore fest, but it has a surprising end. I'm not going to ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. DVD and comments are taken too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to get it in the cast interviews section. Now on my compliment Jillian McWhirter. I could only hope that Jillian would read it. I've never seen her, but wow what performance! I'll tell you the rest. Above all, it should be a serious film. The details I will now describe may sound like camping and entertainment, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but it really isn't. I have it? Good. Jillian is hot, naturally good looking. She's naked for a lot of movie, good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually attacked, terrorized and raped, which is a very bad thing. However, she must act in much of this movie naked. He gets points for overcoming it. He must act happily, sadly, horny, afraid and physically injure everyone within a few moments. Emotion turnover is overwhelming! She is pleased with the joy of learning that she is pregnant. When the extraterrestrials get rid of their guts, they must scream in horror. She has to be very angry when her husband suggests that the child is not his. She had to behave as if she were in denial, and she said there was nothing wrong with her child when her husband said something else. I should notice that it is actually forced upon her by foreigners who control her. I'm talking about performance in Oscar! Then there is a rape scene. It's worrying, but because it's just some rubber alien, it's not bad. In this scene, an alien is not a "gray" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles and it's like a desk. Jillian is at the table-topped, tentacles. The head is an alien head. The stranger's head is long and turns so that the head is now above Jillian's feet. Then the alien heyan-nanu emerges from the forehead. It's a forehead! Sounds good enough, doesn't it? Jillian plays it straight, and she pulls him away! She must behave like an alien with her heyan-nana who comes from her forehead and rapes her and she pulls her away! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what it does. You see, this scene is done in flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance reminiscent of these events. She is lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis when she recalls extraterrestrial kidnapping, but her acting is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many actors can shoot performance in a scene that describes rape that is more intense than a rape scene? Not too much! But Jillian does. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Jillian, if you ever read it, I want you to know that I (the name of the detained) alias MegamanX-1, I believe you're the best actress ever. You are the best actress ever! I could only hope to read it and always take it with you. As for all the others, "Progeny" (1999) is a good movie. I would recommend it.
