Seriously. If it was the first movie in Shack, it would be fun, stupid and goofy. A bright satire commentary on the class system would make this a fun late night rental. However, everyone wants to compare with the first movie, and maybe it's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; What could follow? Nothing. So take this second film as a stand alone and it certainly has its moments. Jackie Mason is fun and makes the best personification of Rodney-Wannabe. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are his lines so good? No. But he's funny. The rest of the cast falls in the line as decent, but not excellent. You will recognize the faces among the actors and wonder how they got to where they are today. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but in this genre the most? Again, this is not the best comedy you will see, but if you like Cannonball Run-type fun, you'll enjoy this.
