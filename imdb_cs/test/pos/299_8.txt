It's the movie that a lot of people come from as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now re-cut, re-up, Redux 22 years after its original release. The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's the main storyline (if one has it) to be Captain Willard on a seagoing ship through the Vietnam conflict on his way to ending a rogue colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he encounters and tell the story of the colonel along the way. My initial feelings for the movie are that sometimes it does not appear separately, especially at the beginning. but at least a good dose of comedy is given in the form of a surf fanatic of Col. Kilgore. But as the film goes on, he and Willard read through various reports about Col. Kurtz until the end, when everything is in sight, when everything is coming together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and keeps it there until the movie goes well. end. The usual aspects that everyone is looking for in a decent movie are good. Especially exceptional is cinematography, where I have noticed the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvallo and Frederic Forrest. The score I initially sounded at the beginning, but how the movie went on ... I'm not really sure if it actually improved, or it was better remembered, or if it just grew on me, but by the end of the movie I was enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I've seen the Redux version (I saw the original about four times), I'll say now when I first saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" movie with lots of wars. The fact that Willard got a mission at the beginning of the film and didn't do it to the end bored me because the whole character interaction on the film's path seemed useless. This is due to the fact that the plot is not fully defined (since the focus is more on character and path than on plot), in most cases a second tracking is needed to fully appreciate the film (as with all films that are more characters than drawing) because you know for the second time where it is going. I had a similar experience with the movie It's a Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. With four big Vietnamese movies, the Apocalypse now wins the rest of the atmosphere, but lacks the action and engagement of the platoon, the emotional intensity of the deer hunter, and cannot be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially towards the end when it becomes overwhelming, and is recommended for anyone who has a good character based film and does not mind occasional violence.
