Sandra Bullock perceives a credible image as a troubled detective, although she sees it as a cynical human-sacrificed victim-turned-pursuer requires a leap of faith (or two). Two ghostly troubled kids are shown adequately by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I have quite a bit of trouble getting Ben Chaplin into the equation (the same problem arose when watching 'Truth about cats and dogs' (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979 I mean, if you give An Englishman in American film, there should be no reason to get him there, there should be no story that would lead the Englishman to serve as There should be no dialogue to point out and explain that it is rather obvious fact, or even some jokes about him, that "English Truth About Cats and Dogs" looked out of place, producers should notice it, distract and annoy the audience (at least me). no good reason or story. <br /> <br /> The film itself: well, thrillers, especially those dealing with g with a complex crime solution, require some suspension of infidelity. In order for Bullock to be smart enough to handle the case, despite all the pressures it required to get rid of it, some unrealistic assumptions are made on the evidence, and I'm sure many people, who watched him had a few moments. "Come on, this is very unlikely under the circumstances" or even "Hey, you can't brush the evidence aside to wrap this movie up!". As I said: reasonably fun and attentive. Do not use it as a desired screen for detective tests. There are no shortcuts.
