The four drug trafficking stories in Europe overlap during these six sub-surveys. In Germany, an entrepreneur is arrested for drug trafficking, and his wife is trying to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade. Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary is traveling to Pakistan to negotiate a package of aid that hopes to stop the flow of drugs from that country. Although he does, his own daughter is addicted to heroin and tears the family. These are miniseries on which American films and miniseries were founded. The original is much better than his two referees. Third world poverty and despair are very well portrayed. It's sharp, uncompromising and brutal.
