I saw the movie in the theater in its release, then watched the VHS tape over the years, and while strolling Target saw this DVD tied up with "Pushing Tin" for exorbitant amounts of $ 5.50. There is something about this comedy that really clicked with me - as Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his thing", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel part and a crew of bolts and misfits. He's against the best navy - the Los Angeles Class nuclear attack and his old captain (Wm Macy). Bruce Dern plays a bad guy, Ripa Torn Admiral, who runs the drill "Don't be hysterical during the" silent "segment with the cook, okay, you got a different kind of humor from me. At the end, the machinist says "DBF" without explanation - apparently some of the inner knowledge got from an old submarine consultant - thanks to Google, I learned that with the onset of nuclear dives, old salts would wear "DBF" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. Navy Friend said many technical aspects are not right, but who cares - it's one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. I don't think there is a need for clairvoyant to know who will win in this exercise!
