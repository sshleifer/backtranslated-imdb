First, don't be fooled by my last name. My mother was a thoroughbred Italian, so I really know Italian families and I love gangster movies, even funny ones like this. <br /> <br /> For those people who have a bad rapp (you know who you are) you should have your movie rights from you because you don't know what's good. This is a damn funny and well styled movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian in it is part of the joke if I see it. And what a red-blooded straight male could complain about having spent an hour and something like Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this movie, I got the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, which was just as Irish as a man, but her pronunciation of Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and sets the tone for what she should follow perfectly. (Damn, I even bought the record that day because I did it.) Just look at every thing I had in the apartment I personally saw in my relatives, though not in the same place (which I found hysterically) , sold for me. This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas. I'm just wondering why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food that these guys were supposed to get? My guess is that the food crew. "Fries are crispy. Cocktails are creamy." My mouth is watering almost as much as she thinks of Mrs. Pfieffer. (And I never trusted the clowns anyway.) And the three best things about this movie are the sad funny wife Mercedes Ruehl who has been refused, Dean Stockwell as her dude husband Tony "The Tiger" and the last but not least a great assault on Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note: find out where the black chick went. Au! Why does it work so rarely? This picture is right next to the big mob movies as it should be.
