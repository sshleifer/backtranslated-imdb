Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her playing more than in this movie. She was really acting like she was Adele August. I appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual personality and create a character that is truly believable. Natalie Portman as Ann August helped to create an ideal opponent as their characters evolved in the film. The movie was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. I gave this movie eight ratings, but Susan got ten from me because of her performance. When it comes to Relationships Movies to Go, Beaches and Endearment Terms had more influence on me than this movie but I highly recommend.
