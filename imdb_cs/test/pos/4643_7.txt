I recorded it as a teenager in the mid-1980s based on a synopsis in a cable guide (a scavenger hunt I liked). what a nice surprise when I looked at it! it was such a fun movie and I remember watching him repeatedly. I thought that the concept was well executed, that I enjoyed harmless competition between different groups and thought the hunter himself was quite smart. Sometimes it seems that people have too much expectations for movies. Not all films will have a serious "message" or stellar play, production value or special effects. sometimes movies are only for entertainment and entertainment, both levels. it was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I haven't seen this movie in years, but if I thought I'd have the same warm and enthusiastic response to it as I did as a teenager. Even if I write it, excerpts from the Syrian, but appropriate theme of the song runs over my head: "When you get the midnight madness ... no matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do." ..!
