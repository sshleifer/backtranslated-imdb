Written by science fiction veteran Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This spatial fantasy is aptly directed by Robert Parrish. Experienced US astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees with a crew flight on the opposite side of the sun. The mission is to be managed by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his researcher, Euro Sec Space Agency, John Kane (Ian Hendry) will accompany Ross. These two will explore a newly discovered planet that is on the same path as Earth ... except that it is always hidden on the other side of the Sun. Ross is the only one who has returned to the ground and has a very incredible story. Special effects can be better than the story. However fun to watch. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
