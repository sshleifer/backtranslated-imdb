Broadly known as "Don't Look in the Basement" - it's the pure horror of the 70s, B-film goodness that could actually go through as the genre version of "One Wow Over Cuckoo's Nest". Although the film does not appear anywhere else than at runtime in the first hour, I enjoyed this strange series of crazy freaks and their various personalities and flaws - such as a former army sergeant, chicks obsessed with caring for a plastic doll, a nice man - child, and a lousy nymph. After murdering their chief physician with a patient, a small nurse hires a new nurse to his workplace with inadequate staff to immerse themselves in various resident ticks and explosions. Things are becoming more strange when patients start to look more abnormal than usual ... You never know or worry about where the film goes, because it's still fun to the end! A few "twists" felt a little too forced and I could use a little more blood, but I really dig a lot of too much underestimated mixture of humor and horror. Check it out ...
