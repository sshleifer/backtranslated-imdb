As you can read in many reviews here is a movie that you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions between that. I think it's a good sign. I've always appreciated this film, even though the genre is not my typical style (for example, I didn't see Titanic and I don't intend to). The grip of an English patient because he shows how different people can be when they are in an exotic environment, unlike when they are "home" (Katherine), shows how destructive love can be slow, in a strong and painful way, it is excited by the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one who leaves behind, the senseless one can feel. The photo is simply stunning, not to mention the actors' game. The pace is slow but timely, namely justice books, timelines, and depth / character development. To put it in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-stratification of this film. People tend to have trouble with the pace of movies ... as if they were in a hurry to get to work .. hey - get life! ;-) Enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
