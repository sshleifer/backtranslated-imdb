In the first twenty minutes, we are confused by a few strongly drawn emotions: the suffocating and overturned mother has a violent argument with her live daughter at the age of 40; piano teacher (and music professor) of love for his pupils expressed by unwavering criticism; the joy that music can inspire both the listener and the performer. In this short period of time our senses were convincingly attacked by very real characters. We are also swept away by powerful music and showed the difference between great and average performance with great attention to nuances. The material itself would be the basis of an excellent film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema is what it is, goes deeper, explores the suppressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and the subsequent collapse in the context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of actual abuse. We are attracted to her suffering and at least initially think about how much suffering can be related to the achievement of genius, especially in the composers she admires. The piano teacher includes a graphic dialogue and a display of sex and brutality in scenes that some people would rather not watch. The scenes are necessary for the dilemmas that the film seeks to evoke, so they can hardly be called unreasonably. A big movie can be, but mainstream watching isn't.
