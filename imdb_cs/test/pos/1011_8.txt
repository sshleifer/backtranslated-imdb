I was strangely attracted to this movie because I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 1980s. Surprisingly, I say it is rather a ridiculous piece of soft fluff, a genre that I am not particularly interested in. Dialogue is pompous and absurdly philosophical (it makes sense, undoubtedly only to its French-Italian producers) and the fence is completely alien. Achieving this goal is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. Scenery (beautiful Philippines), nudity focused on soft focus and wonderful score, all contribute to a strange and extremely careful exercise in such a film that is rarely seen today. It's really one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was lucky enough to find him on an old laserdisk and watch him several times before I think he was healthy. It's worth the mood.
