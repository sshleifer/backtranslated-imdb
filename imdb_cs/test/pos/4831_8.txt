Wicked Little stuff was a really good movie. I have to say on some parts it seemed to be really incredible, and others it seemed like there was just not enough thought in the characters' actions but overall it was exciting and fun. movie reviews so low. I don't understand why all the Horrorfest Afterdark movie reviews are so low. These are B-Movies people, and nothing more. They provide great fun and most of them don't. It is definitely worth a look because you will not be disappointed with the result.
