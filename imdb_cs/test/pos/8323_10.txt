I saw this series in 1999 on London TV and I was blown away. As another commented user - This is what I would like to see when I first watched "Jurassic Park" - The life and death of dinosaurs in their natural environment as a document. CGs are very lively and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shows that it is also very educational. The series takes everything in fact known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas for "what it could be" to make it as close as possible to a documentary series. What I missed was some small bar chart in one corner of the screen, moving between "fiction" and "fact" along with narration and images, because you often wonder how much educated guessing is and how much pure fantasy is. For some facts and fiction information you need to see 50 minutes of "Making Of", which is not only very informative about the CG process and collecting and integrating paleontologist knowledge into the series, but which is also very funny (Dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). I highly recommend watching this series before you go to the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watch any Jurassic Park movie (like) again. They will certainly make you much more critical of these movies. Disney Trailers looked especially bad.
