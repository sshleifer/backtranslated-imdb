Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) must be the biggest video ever made. Dude you have zombies, gore and catchy tune, what more can you ask. John Landis mixed elements from Night of the Living Dead and the American werewolf in London and came out this video. What starts as a beautiful evening for a young couple turns into a date from hell, literally. You have a dance zombie, a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rapping". A great video for a song everyone tagged in the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> I have to give this a high recommendation because it must be the best music video ever made. He wasn't different like that. <br /> <br /> Check out the "Thriller Production". The documentary has some "interesting" things.
