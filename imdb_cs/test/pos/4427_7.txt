Shawn K. Inlow Video Vault <br /> <br /> My Architect: The Way of the Son 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not Rated: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What an orphan is. "My Architect: The Way of a Son" follows filmmaker Philadelphia Nathaniel Kahn, who desperately seeks the answers of his father, renowned architect Louis I Kahn, the dead of those 30 years. Louis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left more than one family. Funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a boy, was, to say, an unpleasant surprise. We found that Nathaniel knew his father, as he had succeeded, from his sporadic visits with his mother, which we said he loved deeply. This film is about a boy who is looking for his father and perhaps even visiting his work as if the beautiful structures kept a secret. Certainly, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but the "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke of his craft in the airy terms of silence and art. His remarkable works, explored lovingly in the film, include the Salk Institute (1965). Kimball Art Museum (1972) and monumental capitol complex in Bangladesh (1983). Part of the movie, where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, Bangladesh, finds a work, but not a man. and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Khan's many contemporaries and associates also help to materialize the spirit of the filmmaker's father. Yet the viewer does not appear to be in a particularly satisfying place. Nathaniel Khan's answers are looking for a seemingly hollow. It's not good enough. In the scenes where the director meets his half sisters, both from different mothers, it is possible to feel the tension of years, lights and hurts. You might expect them to go into anger, but only the camera will save them from hostility. Each of these children has visibly lost something. It can be emphasized that Khan, who seemed to be a perfectionist driven, never got rich. Instead, he became remarkable. It was as if he had sacrificed his family for his art. This is a terribly sad and great thing. April 28, 2005
