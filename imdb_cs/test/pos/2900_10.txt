I bet I watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and I'll do it more often now, when Hollyweird moguls saw it appropriately to put it on DVD because it's a classic with a capital letter "C"! This movie is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 today to see JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with movies like Egyptian; TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD tape; DVD; and cable film channels; I could go forever, but this film is so big and for relative unknown Edmund Purdom carries the film as the Atlas that bore the world. The story is amazing, acting is first-rate and the graphics at the end are so powerful that you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just trying to let the words go! Really a knockout movie. I'd give this 15 stars if they let me! They won't do it this way, but they should !!!!!
