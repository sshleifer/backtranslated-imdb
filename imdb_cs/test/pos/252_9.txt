It took a loan out movie to Columbia for the home studio of Gene Kelly MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own movies. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for GI and their poster fantasy during World War II. Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a dancer and Phil Silvers is a comic. Of course Kelly will bite a bit. Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger loved and lost Grandma Hayworth. In some flashback sequences from the gas light era, Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the husband of the other legendary redhead, Susan Hayward. She wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number Cover Girl is the title song of the movie. It's pretty done in Follies style. Hayworth also gets A Sure Thing singing in the gas light era, and in a single song on the show written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes the old English Poor John Music Hall. When I say sing, as everyone knows, Rita's mouth words. Singing here is performed by Nan Wynn. The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away, introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of World War II and one of Jerome Kern's biggest dealers ever wrote. It happens that my aunt's favorite is my 60 years of marriage to my uncle in September. Long Ago and Far Away were nominated for Best Song, but lost to Swinging on the star. <br /> <br /> What really distinguishes Cover Girl and what makes him a milestone movie for Gene Kelly are two numbers Give Me Test and Algo Ego Number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer refused in MGM, and give Kelly control over his own material. Kelly later said that the alter ego number was one of the most difficult things he had ever tried in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is brilliant and complex. In fact, after one more movie of the loan, a Christmas holiday in Universal, Louis B. Mayer never borrowed Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was in MGM. And since then he has managed to create creative control. With this brilliant technographic cinematography and ritin red hair and the unlimited creativity of Gene Kelly, the girl was Cover and is a classic and will be forever.
