This is an unusual movie because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox, because it's one of the few pairs of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck made movies for many different studies (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made this is my AFFAIR, but Taylor was a MGM player, so he only appeared in this movie because he was loaned to Fox-- something what studios sometimes did during this era. The film is interesting because many people in real life have roles in the film, even though it is otherwise pure fiction. You will see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't remember any movie with McKinley or Dewey in it, even though I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND LION and some other movies. Three cheers for seeing the "smaller president" in the movie as the main character! The film begins with McKinley, who takes the young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asks him to be a special agent for him - and not to tell anyone - nor a secret service. This is because the president is afraid that someone in the agency will slip out of a gang that has been doing a long line of robberies - all based on inside information. So it depends on Taylor (who is not known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to act as a thief and find a gang responsible and inside a person. <br /> <br /> are two serious complications. First, while he is able to find gang members, one of the gang member's step-sister is Stanwyck. Taylor discovers he has fallen in love with her, but he must also do his duty and turn to the authorities. Secondly, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, SERIOUS issues arise when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is on death penalty for crimes !!! The film took care of creating a story and placing it in a historical context. While today most people don't remember McKinley or remember that he was murdered, the film takes place in this interesting time period. Acting is pretty decent because the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, though I have to admit that Donlevy's role was quite tame and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not very happy with the romance department. Good trip for everyone.
