Gary Busey played a great job in Buddy Holly (1936-59). He has a man spitting picture. Being a garage band in the 1950s is certainly different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple in those days. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he was living in Lubbock, Texas, it was just a quiet city. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work. That's one of the reasons he didn't seem like Elvis. He stuck to his kind ways. That makes him good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw the evil producers. They hated the rock-n-roll that Holly overcame. Getting used to another atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and his friends. He went on tour with Sam Cooke and went to the famous Apollo, which was quickly accepted by all African-American viewers. And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and his band had some service. That's what I call tolerance. Sadly, he, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson had a career in music short in 1959, at least their memories will live in our hearts. I don't know what inaccuracies were in the movie, the only thing that matters is that Buddy Holly has overcome the obstacles in music and politics at the time, and the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect in the role and making music. GOD YOU GARY BUSEY YOURSELF! 5 STARS!
