There seem to be two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "Five Figures" is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know they're sucked because they were so smart and already predicted. lame "twist at the end (which is probably in their little minds the only reason the Twilight Zone exists: come up with twists). <br /> <br /> There's a lot of lame episodes in the series to evaluate all the TZ ten episodes. this is certainly one of those who deserves such a rating, it is claustrophobic and colorful, and the tension is built, and we cannot wait for the secrets to be revealed in the end, but whatever the secrets are, it does not matter. It would be just as powerful if we never found out what these strangers really are in a special place.
