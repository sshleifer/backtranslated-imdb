I have to say that when he comes to the Library for film adaptations, the BBC rarely leaves me down. As for this mini-series. I love Starling's novel, it's by far the best murder / secret I've ever read. Mini-series, it defiantly made my day when I saw it. The primary story was held closely perfectly intact. The characters are very well suited to the novel, the personalities and mannerisms were in place for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was done very well, just like Kate, Eric left as a too simplistic figure, had a little more depth in the book, but also changed his story, so he had to deal with it. Of course there are changes, but most of them are cosmetic, but some have found disappointment, the sub-story of Eric's murder murder has been altered, and that has changed the entire dynamics between Red and Eric for the film, and they cut out Triathalon Training Jez did. Some of the other events in the book are changing to be audience-friendly. Despite all, if you like the book, you like it, if you like the mini-series, then you will love the book. I must say that this is the most accurate adaptation of the book to the movie I have seen.
