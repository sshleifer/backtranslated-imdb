To make it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. This is well written and has a fantastic cast. It is not loaded with blood and guts. And he concentrates on the dissatisfied cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and the person who gets the episode in his hack. You'll probably find something similar in your city. It's still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man who was portrayed as a good father despite his shortcomings. Watch more than one (2-3) and see why many of us are addicted to this show. And I thank David Morse that this character is so interesting. Another good job!
