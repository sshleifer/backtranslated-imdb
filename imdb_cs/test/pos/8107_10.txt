Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin, who left his past to deal with the serious subject of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. It depicts two characters - a sweet, innocent Jewish girl - a war veteran and a crazy and reckless dictator, Adenoid Hynek. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for the long term due to the whim of Hynkel and his armed criminals who routinely roughen their residents, or leave them alone, depending on the mood of the day or week. The barber is among them, but he is related to his former commanding officer, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to hold things for a while until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, specifically the barber shop, and the wild young woman Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The prerequisite is - who will be among these Jews to rid their lives on the line of Hynek and his friends? We don't have to guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead bell for the dictator, and he is equipped with his painting, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military equipment. Hannah runs away with some of her friends from the ghetto to Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm and can live for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself was arrested by his armed forces and considered him a notorious barber. Meanwhile, she was accompanied by Schultz on stage to make a statement about the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes is pure Chaplin himself, speaking out of his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began production on film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. He reportedly did not realize the severity of this persecution and hatred and said that if he knew in full, he would never do the movie because he most likely believed he would destroy the situation. He has an amazing cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide, always amazing Billy Gilbert as herring Herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as dictator Napaloni, his conquest rival, European actors veteran David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with a globe, with mere musical accompaniment, is sheer, luminous inspiration and luminous as well as Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiles through her tears. I've seen the movie before, but there's always something new for me. Last night, when I finished, I was sitting there in tears. I give up on anyone who shouldn't move him.
