This movie was wonderful. It's definitely the top 5 hitchcock movie. The overhead and camera shots are almost flawless (outside the dog scene when licking the boy's hand, clearly slowed down). The storyline is well written and realistic. It was very plausible that an innocent man could be trapped like that. Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He did not exaggerate the part that made her believable (like perkins did not fall into part). Overall, this is an excellent movie, the absolute must see all the hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
