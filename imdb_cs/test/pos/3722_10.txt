I am a longtime fan of Luc Besson's work and I have been looking for this film for as long as I know his name. I've been looking for this movie across California for over four years. this summer I made a trip to europe, one of my missions on this trip was at least to see this movie. Long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, I went all the way and finally felt that I had seen Luc Besson's first job. absolutely amazing character development, very provocative thinking, great acting performance and perfect movie concept. If you are a fan of the concept, it is one of the most original and classic. I feel it's a rare experience to see a movie like this, its risky, its unorthodox, and ultimately its absolutely unique. If you are a fan of Luc Besson, his really must see whether your Besson fan or not, his definitely important work, overall a great contribution to the immortal art cinema.
