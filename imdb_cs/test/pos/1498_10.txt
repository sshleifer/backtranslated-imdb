If we hear back to those "Good Old Days" of 1971, we can remember vividly when we were in Karla Chaplin's entire season. That's what a promotional guy said when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can't just remember what it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest spoke about Sir Charles's career and how his films were expelled from circulation in 1952. Little Tramp 'from Los Estados Unidos based on being "unwanted Alien". (No Schultz, he's not from another planet!) CHARLIE was considered "subversive" because of his interest and open mind in various political and economic systems, all from the anarchist movement of the 1920s (and earlier ), a technocracy spreading to socialism in its various forms, was a fair game for discussion in Chaplin's Hollywood pages, which of course involved the inclusion of the Soviet style we commonly call communism. DEFINITION OF FAILURE Mr. Chaplin's difficulty was confused with one little detail, never became an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYWHERE, Enough of This Background Already! IMPORTANT that it says in the United States has become a "Persona Non Gratis". It was high time to get old movies from mothballs and return to the Movie Homes. It would certainly be a great gesture that forgives us and quickly forgets Americanos. It would be a great gesture for a great filmmaker; in addition, the Academy of Arts Films and Sciences planned to honor Chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 Oscar Show. That would surely be a tearful but joyful cover of the pathos that would invite Charlie back to America and let him come and get a special Academy of Lifetime Achievement Award before numbering worldwide television viewers in the Million. BESIDES, it would be natural to promote the Chaplin season in the theater! (Remember that Little Tramp was just as amazing as Bu $ ine $$ Man, as a filmmaker!) The program consisted of performances by MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, KING IN NEW YORK and finally THE CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember that we are very excited about the many dates of the film festival. <br /> <br /> Our Carnegie Theater has been booked at Rush Street in our Chicago city. The festivities lead with MODERN TIMES, and all others will be shown one by one, each stay will be necessary to satisfy the public's desire to follow every picture. As we recall, the last one was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> In RETROSPECT we look back and wish to start with REVUE; as there were undoubtedly legions of viewers (much like us) who knew very little about his accomplishments in the movies, except those of Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts that were shown as a regular feature on so, so many Kiddy shows all over the country. Well, once again, nobody consulted me! CONCENTRATING today's honored guest film THE CHAPLIN REVUE found that it was actually three separate pictures; carefully tied with the use of Chaplin's narrative, some live themes and random music (once again written by Chaplin) and some happy conversation and serious narration (Ditto, Chaplin.) Launches a trial using some home-made film-type film depicting the Chaplin Studios in Hollywood , as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time, showing director Chaplin to demonstrate just what he wants to a group of actors. This segment was well done and well received by the audience. Construction humor and test were intensified by acceleration. (The test naturally, the building by accelerating the camera's photographic process. The old trick allows it to appear that the buildings were built almost alone. This amalgam of shorts included three of Chaplin's short comedy bands. National Pictures, roughly from 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subjects and moods. <br /> <br /> FIRST RIGHT was SHOULDER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions) / First National Paintings, 1918. As Title suggests, it is the story of World War I, which was issued in October 1918 with about a month preceding the Armistice Day November 11. Romance between the private Chaplin and the French girl (Miss Edna Purviance), cheapness is fast, physical and old in old the tradition of ridicule the enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> DISPLAYING THE EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE OLD ADDRESS OF CHILDREN AND CHRISTMAS. Chaplin Productions (First National, 1918) follows the parallel life of Chaplin's Tramp and the newly received stray scraps. The film story includes families, two of them. One Homo Sapiens, one dog and they both supply us with some great surprises. <br /> <br /> AS finals, we have PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923), this was a good choice for the final. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion to the Western Spoof, a comedy of this type has since been made by every comedian and team. "Pilgrim" in the story is not from your standard Thanksgiving variety; but rather "dude" or "Tenderfoot" who has ventured out of the West. Hiker is not just the guy; but his character is a escaped convict who is mistaken for a new spiritual western city church! OUR Rating (ie Schultz and Me) is ****. (These are the four derby) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
