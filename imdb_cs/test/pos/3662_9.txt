"Hari om" is an Indian greeting and convincing title character of the film, which bears this name (played by a wedding planner from a monsoon wedding), greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of South India. There is no "Bend it like Beckham" scenery and stereotypes, and only slight greetings to Bollywood's music and dance (however, the soundtrack is well worthwhile to cater for), but rather the feeling that you see real India penetrates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each the scene to increase the performance of five professional actors. Luckily for us, Hari Om is a young and beautiful French woman who is looking for a way. With the Overture "Y Tu Mama Tambien" trip to self-discovery (no sex and fatal disease), this beautiful movie calms and brings philosophical minds. Against the initial position of the protagonists, they all identify with the features of both and the cultural division disappears while humanity enters in. Most briefly, the central theme of the film, "Everybody has a love story, don't let your pass by" teaches us much about love on several levels. Don't let this film pass you!
