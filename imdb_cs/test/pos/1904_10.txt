Citizen Kane .... Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the only largest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that goes beyond Academy Awards, plays the role of Dolemite, the worst of the universe. She clearly takes no jive from any turkey (I am unfortunately a turkey myself) and proves it with her rapping, pimping and karate chopping skills. This is a blaxploitation in its absolute best, shining example of a genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred of rat-soup eating chase expletive expletive. The True Godfather of Rap (not this new nonsense of Ali) Moore is something like a juxtaposition of acting technique; In some ways, he can become the most charismatic horrible actor of the 1970s and that's what he says. This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for people, if not for one-track.
