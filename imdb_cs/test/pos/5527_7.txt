But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is entertaining, and the billiard table scene with WC Fields must be one of the funniest I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more exciting in their roles than comic, partly due to the lack of scripts and partly their interpretation. I gave him 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, the toilet is the treasure of comedy timing and energy in this.
