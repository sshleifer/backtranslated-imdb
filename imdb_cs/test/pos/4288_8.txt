If we could have "separate tables," why not "separate lies". It becomes somewhat involved. The wife of the housekeeper is killed when she is hit by a car on the bike. The offender turns out to be the woman he cleans. This one had an affair with a friend and drove a car with a lover in it when an accident occurred. To make things even more complicated, the housekeeper once worked for her parents and had her imprisoned for theft. That's why people will hesitate to believe it was his car that caused the accident. It sounds like she wants revenge. All this becomes intricate. When our housekeeper discovers that her chauffeur has been driving the car, her testimonies will be largely discouraged by the dismay of the officer working on the case. As if not enough, a few months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to look after him. Acting here despite the endless "Peyton Place" as a theme. Tom Wilkinson is a lawyer who is trying to protect his wife. The film is good, but we could do it without a terminal illness. Well, marriage ended the same.
