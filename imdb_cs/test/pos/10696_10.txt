After I saw this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me who have been blown away by a rocket-powered ninja action and white hot sexual titration that is Ninja III: The Domination. /> <br /> We all know Sho Kosugi rocks. This is given, but how about an ultra macho interpretation of his character's police officer "Billy Secord"? Bravo Mr. Bennett, bravo. You can soon, when you are trying to tempt buxoma Christie (playing one Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin 'Fame), that you are not afraid of your craft. I especially enjoyed how you don't feel the need to enter and try to help her because 4 criminals are trying to rape her outside her gym. You could have helped it, but when you stood there and watched you let her know who the boss was. Secord will wear pants in this relationship. I also looked forward to seeing Mr. Bennett not afraid to take off his shirt repeatedly or wear a shoe on his tank, even though he had a gorilla like his shoulders and back. The back and shoulder hair is hot and Secord knows it. What about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sexual bomb ready to explode. He has all the right moves as seducer and martial arts. Chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie a tick. You think she would hate him because he's a little kitschy jerk, but not my friends. The animal's magnetism is too strong to resist and combine like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as prominent as you might think, even though he is still the main character who is fine for me because I wanted more Bennett and Dickey. She seems to wear a lot of eye makeup that was nice to see. Special Effects? Wow. That's all I can say. I will not forgive the end, but let's say it will not disappoint. I love Ninja III: Dominance, and I can only hope that there is a Ninja 4. I give him 5 out of 5 star throws. disappoint.
