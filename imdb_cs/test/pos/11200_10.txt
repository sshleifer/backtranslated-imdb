This is the latest film of the trilogy by the brilliant Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose most recent film, Mayis Sikintisi, was screened at prestigious film festivals. Unlike previous films, the story "Uzak" takes place in Istanbul, which is one of the most crowded cities in the world. In Ceylan's film, however, we see only slight traces of this huge crowd. Rather, he decided to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his relatives who came from his little village to find work on transatlantic ships. A photographer who understood that he also emigrated to the city seems to be inhabited by the habits of urban life, not only in the material sense. In relation to his relative, we see him as caring and tolerant at first, but when he couldn't find a job, our suburban character begins to be disturbed to share his private "space" with someone whose departure date is ambiguous. I will not disclose the tactics that he develops in order to free his relative from life to prevent any harm to your attention, but just say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we get in the routine of suburban life; "Tactics" to maintain their own private space, "tactics" to avoid communication with other people, "tactics" that would prevent our relationships from gaining complexity (because of our own experience, we believe it is complex enough). Br /> <br /> Ceylan's film is a clear picture of what a human being becomes in the boundaries of a modern (or postmodern?) City by displaying two characters in different ways. However, he does not condemn any of the two characters for doing so, but rather uses the power of film language to emphasize this difference. For example, when looking for new opportunities, we always see the character coming from a village in open spaces. Even in the house he prefers the balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we always see the photographer in closed rooms and generally at home. Although there are more than 10 million people and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things you can discover (or are they?), Prefers to sit at home, watch TV, etc. His home is like his temple, some kind of sacred place. Anyone who lives in the city and is aware of the experience he / she is experiencing will find something in Uzak that belongs to himself. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy the other two Ceylan films, Mayis Sikintisi (May Clouds) and Kasaba (City). Go and find them!
