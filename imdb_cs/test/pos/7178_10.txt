A film with high intelligence and activity. In addition to being a powerful capsule of time and personality that was the 1960s, this film is also surprisingly surprised by its themes and the unique presentation of the power system in the group. William Greaves is named an authoritative role in the group. He asks his crew members to shoot film and film. First two actors, then the crew of the actors, then the whole lineup, including bystanders, police, and finally the homeless who lived in the bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. Greaves edits the movie (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly creates a strong story with an interesting arc and motivation. Don't expect this movie to bore you. Each crew member engages in the conversation and often expresses the idea that the observer is watching the film. Greaves works well to integrate multiple cameras using synchronized three-in-one images and other attention shift methods. Finally, the film will only be really effective if you are looking for what you are looking for. If you're looking for some abstract art movie that feeds your own self-indulgent ego while having a point, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film that will talk to you and think about the longing for sincerity and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that follows, then this is the perfect film.
