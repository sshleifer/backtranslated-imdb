I have never seen the original Death of Wishes in the book Death of Wish I. (film). However, Death Wish 3 was a very interesting movie. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend, Charlie, but he only visited him for a few minutes before he died because Charlie had not paid protection to a huge and infamous underground gang led by Manny Franker. After some quarrel during his time in prison, Kersey learned that Franker, who he had struggled with in prison had his own program to make the New York City in hell (and also its influence) by sending his followers to set the crime every time, \ t everywhere and every day. Given the chance given by the Insp. Richard Shriker, who knows his profile well and enjoys it very much. Kersey decided to arrange a war with Franker and his gang. I accepted that Death Wish III is one of the most direct action movies I've seen from the past. This film used a very straightforward way to tell a story. No cumbersome story and less useless scenes, which was one of the advantages of the film. On another theme, violence was used ubiquitously in the film. I believed that many viewers might like the Death Wish III action scene because it showed a rude, extreme and explosion of action for every minute of the movie, especially the movie's top scene and Manny Franker's death, which I thought was the ultimate action scene . The fact that it is a cast I think everyone was good and got over their role. Charles Bronson convinced everyone that he was still great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like a "big old cat," but great vigilance. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main villain role in the film made him look ugly and look like a big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this film was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought there were only two or three scenes before she was killed by Franker and his follower to warm up on Paul Kersey. She could have a bigger role to appear. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this straightforward style and extreme violence have made this film great for fans of extreme action movies. Fast-paced back and Forth style made this movie very keen to watch. However, this film had some stupid scene and some hole plot. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker first faced Paul Kersey. It was very scaly because you attacked your favorite before you want him to help, it's similar to how you share a guy before you try to borrow some money. Ha-Ha! this is like a joke! Although I liked the plot conspiracy when Insp. she had no hidden agenda with Kersey. In another case, the final scene of the film has given way to me. It hits everyone's feelings because it has ended too easily. Franker's gang members looked incredible after they discovered Franker was dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out of his city before the police caught him. I thought this style of ending scene can be found in many Cannon Film movies, but I don't like it. To summarize, I'm fine with Death Wish 3 for my explanation I wrote first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even though she had a scene I don't like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence can be the best short description of this film.
