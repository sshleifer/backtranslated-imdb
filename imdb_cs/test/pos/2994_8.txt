First love. Teen love. We all experienced it, even though it wasn't as sweet as the protagonists. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "Blue Lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remake from the 1980s (most popular, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with the young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" puts two young lovers into the desert island, without contact with civilization, "Friends" goes the other way and it is certainly much more ringtones and a more difficult movie with the current audience. Paul and Michelle, who, for various reasons, turn to the family and adult world to live together in a small cottage in southern France. With their mutual friendship and innocence in childhood, their friendship is slowly developing to a much greater extent because they are trying to stay in this sweet age story. This film is still controversial because actors are teenagers and they certainly look forever, which are featured in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child molestation, nudity, teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. But real controversy is not the subject, but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. Although it was fine for lovers stranded at another time and on a desert island, their modern environment presents very difficult moral issues. Laws prohibiting consistent sex between minors are basically in all countries, and the lack of sexual education in adolescents is considered to be one of the causes of the rise in unwanted pregnancies and abortions to adolescents. Is a film like this just a child pornography or a slap in the face to confront our own hypocrisy when it comes to a modern society that does not provide teenage parents and laws that unequivocally contradict human nature and hormonal development, but which are necessary to do so , to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As a piece of art, this film is a truly forgotten and rough jewel. The scenario proceeds with extreme simplicity, even if it is lucky, but it never pulls any strikes to convey its message, although today's standards are somewhat slow. The photo is beautiful and has scenes of great beauty. The action of the two protagonists differs from really horrible in some scenes to amazingly innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most productions today, is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the protagonists' thoughts. Overall, it's a breathtaking piece, even though moral values ​​aren't in line with your own.
