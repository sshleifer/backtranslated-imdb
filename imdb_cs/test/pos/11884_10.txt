This film is a good example of why Shaw Brothers is one of the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well paced, the story is excellent and interesting, and while humor does not have to be on the face, it is embedded in the character of interaction. As the story builds and the characters begin to evaluate the situation, the entire tower falls apart in one of the best battle scenes (tiger, crane and Hung Gar crab are very present). There is even a scene that mocks the 18th century Western social events, and ends with a clever and entertaining battle. The film ends with a sudden, shabby moment, but if you are a Shaw Brothers fan, you will understand that cheese is just glaze and not the main course of the film.
