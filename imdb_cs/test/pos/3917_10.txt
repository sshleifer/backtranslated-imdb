That was the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life, the action was great, and I was so scared, there was a lot of horror that CREATED BIG, I saw it 1000 times more and Paris Hilton, D * MN in the movie is fine . But I would still recommend it to everyone, even to children (like me). You'd probably have nightmares at night, but besides being awesome, I can stop BRAGING ABOUT IT. EVERY SINE AUGEST WHEN I ARE HEAVY ABOUT THESE BRAGGATES AND BRAGGUANES AND IN SCHOOL I GIVEN A BOOK WITH THE WORD 6 HOUSE OF WAX. I got the whole school into it. But still I would definitely say that it can 6 house wax, be there It's killed.
