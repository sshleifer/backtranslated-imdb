I saw this movie on a little screen. Although it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence cast helped make this little gem of the film. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters is in their "mid-twenties" watching some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn about Nirvana's suicide by Kurt Cobain. They quickly get inspired to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and visit Cobain vigil. It is here where the film really recruits and serves a range of witty and emotional scenes. The most important are: visiting the grave of Jimi Hendirx, the original children's home of Kurt Cobain and singing the campfire. Honest original piece of work.
