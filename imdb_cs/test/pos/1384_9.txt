Once in a while you come across a movie that will surprise you and that's one of them. On a surprising scale, this could be seen as sharing a hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a band composed of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon plays the night. The reason why this movie will surprise you is that because of the modest budget they had (Â£ 8,000) and that a lot of friends did it to try it, they made something very neat and look simply a hundred times more than its budget. There is a simple crew of mercenaries on the property, carrying dangerous prisoners across the universe. After some controls, not only does the planet not exist according to stellar graphs, but they do not seem to be alone, and something very unfriendly will begin to collect one by one. Sounds like very standard Sci-Fi fare elements mixing strangers. Predator and Pitch Black, but it all takes and makes them feel fresh and original. <br /> <br /> Taking photos in this location is fantastic, making the most of Balmeddie Beach in Aberdeen and really feeling like you are a foreign world. The seemingly never ending sand dunes and clever light effects give him a very bleak feeling, you really think the crew is stranded in a strange world. Also, the action sequences are excellent, the launching attack on the cargo ship is a great showcase of what can be achieved by special effects on the budget and firefights, as well as the stunning finals that showcase the film's ingenuity. <br /> <br /> As for the mercenary team, the cast excels. For a low-budget independent film, casting took place through local media and seems to have chosen some possible stars for the future. While local body builder Mike Mitchell is not a natural actor serving in his role as Arnie-Esq mercenary leader. From the rest of the cast are two performances by Patrick Wright second in McNeal and Scott Ironside as a rough and prepared Vince engineer. Both have some of the best lines in the movie and Scott puts a good piece of humor into the movie with his performance. Patrick gives a well rounded performance as a great ice commander. Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved, and shows that Scottish cinema doesn't have to be "Kilts and Ceilidhs" or Scottish Slums and Drugs can be fresh, resourceful and above all fun. This film is Scottish (Northeast flavor) to the core and praise actors and directors for keeping intact accents, which adds charm to the piece. Although budget constraints sometimes show up (the only mistake I could find), which one can expect. This film, its cast and crew deserve all the achievements they get, and then others. Mark and his crew wish every success for every wish and their careers are very attentive. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish science fiction is bold, fresh and imaginative. triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and opinions like no other plus excavation bi-weekly sub-cast. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br />contact@fightrunner.co.uk
