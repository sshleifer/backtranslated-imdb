I picked up the DVD for 1 ??? discount, I have no idea what it is (but I can't resist at that price ..) In short: I was positively surprised. So much that I did some research. On the German DVD (Part 2 of Series 3), the episodes were recombined into two 85 minute sections, and out of sequence. Here are my results, based on the Wikipedia episode list: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is In My Boots + The Voice. "War of the Machines" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Under Listener + Juggernaut Down. Well, what can I say. Of course, subordinate girls are of interest to older men. I've never seen Charlie's angels so much, so I can't compare, but the more I looked, the less I looked at bikinis and their fillings. Instead, the characters (both m and f) became more interesting. I can imagine that feminists also enjoy it. All in all, maybe the guilt of pleasure, but the pleasure was: ^)
