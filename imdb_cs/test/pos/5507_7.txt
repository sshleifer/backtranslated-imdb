This off-beat horror movie seems to be a shortage but a bad review. My question is: why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider very well led to the first (and only) time management. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This film seems to have a future perspective. Although it came out in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet predators seem to be the basic plot. Although we are at a different level, this is a problem we are still facing. I admit that this story has been lost several times, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie at all. Robert Englund is even in this movie that does it better. Behavior was not bad, the characters were also good. I think Hendriks was a pretty good opponent. I give it off-beat horror 7/10. Recommend for Saw fans.
