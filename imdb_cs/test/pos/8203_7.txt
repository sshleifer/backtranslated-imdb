When "The Net" was first published, the ads looked ridiculous. When I saw it, it was actually pretty good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spends her days working on the computer and has never known her neighbors. Then, through a series of events, her identity will be erased by a cadre of dark people, and cannot prove she exists. Some parts of the movie are a bit far-fetched; you probably know which parts you would see. Yet it is a good view of what can exist on the Internet of unsuspecting people. I recommend it.
