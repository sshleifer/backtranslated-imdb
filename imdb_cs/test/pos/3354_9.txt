The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland? X-Rated Music Comedy" was the early '80 at the Cinema-Theater in N.Y. City with a few friends. I remember we liked it a lot, although we were wondering why all the "goodies" were covered in different forms in the form of color patches and why the movie suddenly jumped from one scene to another and let us guess ... what we just missed. Apparently it was a soft-core edited version that left me with a desire to follow it again, but in its original integral version. Well, more than 20 years ago, during which I forgot about this movie, and just a few days ago, by accident, I came across a heavily used copy of VHS (which saw better times: a little faded color), scratched sound and several flaws) but guess what? It is an original uncut version and this time I really had the ball! Humor, music and porn may sound awkward, but in this case it really works and it is unlikely that the vast majority of boring porn movies nowadays attack our screens, it's a really fun and fun sexual fantasy that won't let you down. The direction is clever, fast editing makes the movie fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are nice or just funny, all the actors seem to have a good time, the songs are catchy (it is worth noting that "growing up" sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and merry "What a nice girl like you do on such a knight"), dance numbers are well choreographic and staged (amazingly energetic Terry Hall proves she can "dance" and dance, too, dances her courage ... Don't worry, she also doing what was best known ...), acting, singing, set, costumes are good and then ... is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first major role of his career and (oh boy!) He really has a couple of HC sequences ! Personally, I think they are not completely disgusting, on the contrary they are spontaneous and quite exciting. She's young and (ohhh!) So beautiful; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland, discovering her body and her sexuality, singing, dancing and ... what do you expect? She also experiments with sex! The final sequence, when he finally loves his friend, is extremely well photographed and directed and is the pinnacle of the film. I think her "character du role" (innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting skills make these explicit sequences more than acceptable and really very fun. There is a lot of sex in Wonderland and everyone seems eager to get to work with the first available boy (s) or girl (s). On the other hand, some detailed shots, clearly "entangled", just to make "pornhounds" really happy, are a little superfluous for my personal taste. In general, sex action is not insulting because it has done with great humor and blends almost without any problems with music, dance and comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you'll have an hour and a half of good time (maybe an additional event after the show ...) This is "Adult Entertainment" so be careful not to leave this video around or among other video kids. If you can put your hands on it for 10 years, you can have some fun, but you'll be forced to give an embarrassing explanation of the reasons why "Alice" behaves differently than the one in the Lewis Carroll novel or the Disney video. I bet you won't forget this "unique" soon. It is a real pity they won't do this anymore ...! I give him 9 out of 10.
