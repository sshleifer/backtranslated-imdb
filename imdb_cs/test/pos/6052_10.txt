I have seen this movie and anyone with everyone with Marines or any branch of service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It's a must for every collection. Jack Webb has a great job as a hard drill instructor. My father went to the Marine Camp at Camp Penelton and says this film is so precise that he feels like in basic training. There's a line in the movie that Jack Webbs puts on the shoe to kill the sand. Well, let me do nothing but sand fleas in the camp. I was there and I can appreciate it. In fact, the exit to Las Puljas, which in English means the city of fleas. you have to watch a movie to appreciate what I say. Anyone in the movies of World War II, all battles begin here with the Sgt drill. They must have a collection for you
