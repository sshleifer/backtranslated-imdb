After a very long time Marathi cinema came up with some good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. It shows how the old grandfather tries to save his grandchildren. He tries everything in his hands to save his eye. The doctor and his relative are trying to help him in his attempt. The actions of grandfather, boy and doctor are simply excellent. They showed a true picture of the typical life of Marathi. Every piece of action has some meaning in it. I would recommend taking a look at this movie because at first I thought this would be a documentary type, but that was beyond my expectations. This movie really touches your hearts. come up with such performances.
