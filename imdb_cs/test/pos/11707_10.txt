WHAT ARE: If not for the work of Mick Molloy, then for Judith Lucy. It brings her usual elegant style of unrestrained foul-mouther to the role and steals the show in parts. is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin just makes an appearance look, Molloy not just stars but co-wrote and co-produced this film. I was a fan of their years (apparently I was the only one who laughed during the on-set urination in the first episode of Mick Molloy Show), so I went into it with high expectations. I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. Mick does a lot of work on this stuff with a lot of his usual trademarks. Phrases like "blow it up" and "these bowls are with *** house" are everywhere, as well as lots of Winnie Blues are sucked down. It's also such a stupid, original story you'd expect from someone like him. It's like one of those comic, American, sports comedies where they make a baseball team or something out of a baseball team. But instead of trying to make a boring American sport, like baseball or grate, interesting, this film focuses on the sport usually left in the gray army: Grass Bowls. But the main difference between this and other sports comedies is that it's actually very, very funny. Better yet, the subject of this film is a young puppet who joins old people, but is never offensive to the elderly, and never happens to be helpless. It's just a good laugh at the actual 1972 prizes. Mick is great at the first real acting role I've ever seen, just like Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but most have had a lot of practice ... That's the best Australian comedy I 've seen long. Go look and learn the joys of lawn bowls! ARE BIT LIKE: Major League? SCORE: 8/10
