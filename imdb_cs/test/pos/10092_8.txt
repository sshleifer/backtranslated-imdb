The idea is not original ... If you have seen such a story before, you would know what the end would look like in the first twenty minutes ... the screenplay, the location of the actors and the screening too ... If you haven't seen such a story yet, it's definitely a good experience , at the end you will enjoy a twist ... don't forget to check it out again when you know the "truth", you will even enjoy the conspiracy ... Even though I have a true guess at the very beginning, I still couldn't help sticking in my position to the end ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Must be seen! ! This one from Korea is better than any of the recent Japanese genre movies ... forget about Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Don't miss it !!
