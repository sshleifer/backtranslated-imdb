I would strongly disagree with the previous lame commentary. I watched that he wasn't expecting it too much. The fact is that the cast was excellent, especially the Teen Teen Woman. The dark sides of all of them went through, all messed up. There was a basic stream that passed through the film of teen anger and sexuality. The role of a serial killer also played well as you felt he had gone through what they had as children. What is a movie is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree not to do it, but you could relate to the confused teenage heads who did what they did, and it's believable. Also a decent dark ending, instead of which could easily be opt out a happy one. The attention to detail in the film was also fantastic. I am a very good solid 7 out of 10. A little slow at times, but allows the thinking person to see where the characters are coming from.
