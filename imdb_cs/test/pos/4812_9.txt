If you're familiar with the work of Johnny To and his Milky Way filmmaking band, you know what to expect with this latest production. All known elements are in place: a strong friendship between two characters: usually a cop and baddie, coincidences and chances of a dime turning on and finally paying off, and humor that arises in the most dangerous cases. Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours of life and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films as "Longest Thread", "Hero Never Dies" and "Where A Good Man Goes") captures hostage / cop negotiator who is on a robber tail, even as a robber prepares a series of tricks and the tracks that must follow to get his man. Funny, engaging and cool when it's soft, "running" is actually one of the funniest Milky Way movies. Don't miss the performance of both leaders, esp. Andy Lau, usually considered an average actor who seldom was that natural and fun to watch. This movie is the one that goes out.
