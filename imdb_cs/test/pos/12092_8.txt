This is a great document and the above comments briefly summarize how much it was, so I won't repeat the same compliments. But Faith alike, being a Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than a common European, falls into a trap of orientalism that other Western artists usually fall. But come to know that you are Turkish blood and your film could be deeper and could describe what is outside of "beyoglu-old city". The performances of Muzeyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay look into the film and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass of a Turkish rapper) speaks of American gangsta rappers that I totally agree. I recommend this movie to my American friends.
