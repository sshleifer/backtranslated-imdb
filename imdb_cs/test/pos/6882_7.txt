Koreans will now knock down US horrors. But they do it with style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even has a CHILDREN'S PLAY for it. Several young adults are invited to take part in a special event in a doll's gallery just to find that they are the target of a vengeful spirit. Dolls come to life and make some nasty things for kids. The level of gore is reasonably high, photography and design and production settings are first-class, acting is not so bad, and the scary is definitely there. DOLL MASTER doesn't have to be in the same league with TALE OF SISTERS or even DEAD FRIEND, but it's close. Give him a watch. You won't be disappointed.
