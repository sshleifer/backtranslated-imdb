I just got home from Radio. I haven't seen such an inspirational story for a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old and I would like to take them to "feel" the message I did - you should try to find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge for their differences . Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris deserve the Academy Awards for this film. I don't know why we can't have more movies like this, rather than junk that is served in theaters every day.
