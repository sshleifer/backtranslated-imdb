If there were two parts that the physically looming, ugly-charismatic actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was born as a Frenchman to play, it must be certainly Cyrano de Bergerac and speaker Georges Danton. Here, the film controls both shoulder width and power of voice; his charisma bears part despite the fact that he has as much blood on his hands as the others. Danton feasts while Paris people are starving ... but he is the one who can question the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Committee on Public Security in the name of "freedom", and is presented as the hero of the film - despite the fact that the source game practically challenges its opponent Robespierre! For those who know the characters of history, there is an interest in identifying smaller parts: the frog-facing Tallien, the Couthon cripple, the Fouquier-Tinville prosecutor's tribunal, the spirited fop St-Just, the epic painter David. But the scenario in this respect will shorten little will; the names are often late in coming if smaller characters are identified at all, and there is no Hollywood-style 'info-dump' to ensure that the audience can place events in their historical context. The film takes it for granted that you know what happened before, and what happens next - sometimes it takes too much for granted, because when it relies on a thorough knowledge of the data that would give the tail of its tail the fact that Robespierre followed Danton briefly to the scaffolding. Considered as a movie, it's not entirely satisfactory because it reflects towards the end. The structure of the story leads to some great confrontation of protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic culmination of a process that never happens through history. Things just disappear: there is no rebellion, there is no overthrow of tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the winner, there is no victory on both sides. This can be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory as a result of the screenplay - it seems a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it might have been more logical to act until the end of Terror and show the fall of Robespierre in its fall.
