Originally, I saw this movie in Times Square at the end of the 1980s. Who would have thought that this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following. Demon Night Day was like most other movies that came out at the time. suddenly in different horrible ways. Think of the formula still used and still seems to work, as shown by Saw II, which I recently saw. I saw Mimi Kinkade at the Fangoria Convention o Six years ago and she was so delicate heart! I think it makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed by a woman in all these horror flicks. as I remembered when I first saw it, but then it quickly rises. One of the 1980s horror classics and worth a look!
