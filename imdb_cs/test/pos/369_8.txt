I was lucky that this movie came to TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's hard to find, even though it's Hitchcock's classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock repeated later. First, the end is too clean and "perfect". There have been tremendous tensions in the last few scenes, up to the last five minutes; then, for five minutes, everything was erased ... very unsatisfactory. The end is also too dramatic, for the Hitchcock movie. He is, was, and always will be a master of tension ... why would he be as low as a cheap action sequence at the end? In addition to a few shortcomings, the film is great. Land is excellent; one of the best and most versatile ever. Topic? Simple. You'll meet a stranger. A perfect alien. He will offer you to kill someone ... you know you have someone you want (if nothing else, unconsciously) dead. Catch? He asks you to do the same for him ... do you accept this bizarre but sophisticated system? You're a clear suspect, and so is ... neither of you knew the victim. And you don't know each other, either ... you're just "strangers on the train." A brilliant concept, and one that can only relate to each person. Stimulation is good, you will never lose interest or patience. The film is good, but not as good as in other, better Hitchcock movies. Acting is flawless. The characters are well written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he often uses; The dominant mother, mother of mothers, etc. The film is very good, but feels a little submerged. It wasn't a great extra mile that was great. He paused before crossing the boundary between what is common and what is bold. This is the main reason why the film is not great, but mainly remains good, with the potential to be more than that. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. But all that leads to the end is very good, so the film still deserves 8/10. Good, but not great. Every Hitchcock fan should see it because it's among his best ... somewhat far from the list, but still there. I recommend every fan of Hitchcock. 8/10
