This is one of those films where you must, on the one hand, mention some of its obvious flaws (the result of date and place of its production) and highlight the positive. In many ways it is a really great movie. Forgive the parody of one line, but the most serious flaw for an English speaker like me was horrible headlines. The print I saw had in 1982 the Soviet headlines "Film Export", which consistently used inverted grammar, probably to impress the 13th century speech. The real impact of this nonsense is that it is more difficult to watch subtitles, which means you spend less time looking at pictures. Since cinematographic images are a great force for these films, this is a real problem. Other IMDB-niks have written a lot about Stalin's propaganda elements of this movie (only if the viewer doesn't notice for himself). They also wrote a lot of information about the battle on the ice scene, which I think is excellent. Interest in love is almost completely devoid of subtlety, yet strangely ... ... almost completely devoid of charm. But it is good to feed here and there. <br /> <br /> I met this movie long before I saw the movie. Paintings and music complement each other perfectly. And these are the images that will stay in your mind for a long time in mind. Bergman learned clearly from these paintings - an image of his medieval pieces (eg the Seventh Seal, the Virgin Mary Spring), which builds on and strengthens Eisenstein's thoughts. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, albeit erroneous. <br /> <br /> For modern viewers, I suggest that you go with the stream and enjoy the many exhibitions.
