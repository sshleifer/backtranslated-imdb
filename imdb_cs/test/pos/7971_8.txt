A huge action movie I've ever seen. It was the first expression I said when I watched him twice on a local TV in my country, Indonesia. A combination of constant shooting and great choreography that David Bradley plays well. He was good here beside the "American Samurai." His martial art skill was performed above average. He managed to make the battle scenes look nice. Not only do punching and kicking like what most martial artists show in their movies. David Bradley could use all the techniques of martial arts like throwing, smashing and kicking. Very recommended for action fans. I tried to search for a DVD, but I still can't do it especially in my city. Can anyone help me?
