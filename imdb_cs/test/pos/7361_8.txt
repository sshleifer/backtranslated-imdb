I can't believe I enjoyed it just like I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the connecting story and its surprising end hooked me. Lots of familiar faces will keep you on the question "where did I see them before?" Forget the running time shown on the New Line tape, it's not 103 minutes for my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot puts on a bonfire in its own special way and sets off on it.
