One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short "Chess Fever", a crazy story about how a strictly intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an uncompromising comedy as chess found earlier sales in this wonderful short moment. Two young men playing game seriously against artificial background, painted file. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', where human activity was intentionally framed by the natural environment. The difference in activities (natural = feeding the baby, watering the garden, artificial = chess) is perhaps significant. The main difference in this film is between this immobile background and the calm, balanced game of chess and the harsh passion that causes the accusations of cheating to lead to undignified melee. The intellectual game becomes gross physical scrap, just as the demands on artistic filmmakers are deflated forever by "cruel" audience demands. What is most fun about the film is not necessarily this descent into slapstick, but the way it is filmed, its prolongation long after the initial joke has been made; the way the camera refuses to dignify with something like attention instead of focusing on the set while we see veiled legs and loose clothes. Refusing to film is bold, so humor seems to be based on something other than combat, reflecting our need for physical contact with intellectual stimulation, our unwillingness to let go. Especially brilliant is the denouement, because these upper classes are caught by a valet who picks them up as the two poorest students as if he is about to stuff his ears. Unless masters can be expected to keep their place with decoration before anyone has to do it for them.
