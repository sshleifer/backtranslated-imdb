Sister Betty has this strange but winning combination of a repellent, non-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. Just as I loathed Fargo the first time, then I realized I was still thinking about it a few days later, and somehow I enjoyed it, I liked Nurse Betty much more than I saw her. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it is in many ways quite forced, but it seems to be part of what makes it so striking. Fair Work Greg Kinnear, a great work from Morgan Freeman (though I'm afraid to be stereotyped as a principled villain). Chris Rock was good, but not standout. Rene Z. is so natural that it is unnerving - that is, he is anxious to be "natural" to play someone who is not well in the head. Also liked the kind of "abrasive spark" performance from Allison Janney in a small part. Don't wait as much as a "road movie" as you might expect from some synopsis. (There is a "way," but it's hardly relevant.) Rated 8/10.
