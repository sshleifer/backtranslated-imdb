While it's not "perfect," it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, NW Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Chief of Superman Police), Housewife, Waiter at Felix Restaurant and Judge ...... children grew up with him! "Baby swallowed a watch" was always a favorite line of my son. Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and coats stole the show along with stuffed, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and recommend that you skip the remake (blah).
