The story told The Cranes is Flying is certainly not the original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to be both. We've seen it many times before. However, we haven't seen it before, with brave shots that take freedom to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable, what comes from the Soviet Union, and the reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern Soviet film. I read the Waiting "Three Sisters" and the next day I talked about what the meaning of this film might be. In Act 2, Masha objects that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding: MASHA: Surely humanity must believe in something, or at least seek the truth, otherwise life is just. emptiness, emptiness Living and not knowing why cranes are flying, why babies are born, why stars are in the sky, either you have to know why you live, or everything is trivial - mere nonsense. Similarly, Veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her suffering and the suffering of others were pointless. It is better to assign meaning, to live as if the life of man was significant, and not to despair. It is perhaps this thinking that leads her to her final act in the film. <br /> <br /> BTW as a minor correction of one more comment here - in the movie there may be a V pattern, even though I didn't notice them. But Veronica's first letter is not yet another example; in the Cyrillic alphabet, her name begins with a letter that looks like an English "B".
