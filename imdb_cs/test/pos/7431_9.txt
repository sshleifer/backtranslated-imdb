This movie is based on the game series: Final Fantasy. This is especially about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to have turned into a movie, I loved CG, that was amazing. Lots of great fighting scenes, events and characters to make the movie unforgettable. If he's your fan of the game, you'll love this movie. Personally, I'm not a tough fan of games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from Final Fantasy VII next to Cloud would have to be Cid. I love Cida, I think he's cute. I was amazed at how real CG images were, it was amazing, it's a game in 3D. I had a great time watching the movie, and by the way, I love aeons, especially Bahamut, he's great! Overall, I put this movie 9 because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes, it's on my list of movies to get. The characters were amazing, loved CG, the story was amazing, with many actions and battle scenes. All-in-all, it's the best movie I've ever seen, based on video games.
