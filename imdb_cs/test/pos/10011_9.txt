I have to say that every time I see this film, I am deeply affected not only by the most painful four years of my life in Hongsheng, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that if one becomes addicted to something like drugs, alcohol or pornography, it can not only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. As the family is a No. 1 priority in Asian culture, circles need to be gathered to show one person how much his family loves him. This is actually the first Chinese movie I actually enjoyed, not for fun, but the elements that surround it (great acting, moving story, great direction) make this movie worthy of watching. What is most exciting is that Hongsheng and his family are doing the story themselves, instead of having a B-film actor trying to imitate a real person. Shows the authenticity of the film.
