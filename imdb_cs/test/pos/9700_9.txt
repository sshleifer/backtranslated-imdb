We all see countless previews and trailers. If you enjoyed Knoxville getting turned Bull you will have great bodily pleasure in opening the "act". But I have to pay attention to the masses, I was thinking of marrying my (less than 18) son with me, but I was relieved not to be. This compilation of annoying parodies contains several, though so funny, as they may seem to the adult community. These guys have to get paid a big ransom to tolerate some godly pieces, sometimes they play at their expense. In particular, Bam Marger and Ehren McGhehey are confused by the band in a few special bits. Enjoy
