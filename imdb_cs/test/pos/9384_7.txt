The big bed possessed by the demon eats people, among other things. I'm not making it up. Completed in 1977 and not officially released when it came to DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a movie whose plot cannot be described. Most likely you know about it thanks to excellent Patton Oswalt, as well as Stephen Throwers' basic book "Nightmare USA". Watching it cares about the following <br /> <br /> -Who is George Berry and what drugs he smoked / injected / snorted before writing and directing this movie? Is it a horror comedy? A combination of horror film and artistic film? A strange joke that is attracted to the audience? <br /> <br /> -What the hell am I? "Death Bed" really defies any explanation. I know, the term is exaggerated, but it couldn't be truer than it is here. This really beggar description. It's a horror comedy, just like an artistic film / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so unreal, it has to be seen. The score sounds like electronic pieces from the old Candlemass album, acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent and the film sometimes feels like the movie of Jesus Frank - that is, if his films were deliberately funny. Finally, there is no right way to describe this film. Sir knows I've tried, but really, few movies are so special, unique, or it's a stunning mind. You see it ... but you were warned. That's also the only movie that George Berry has ever done. I'm sure he left it to the genre of exploitation with this, I'll tell you so much.
