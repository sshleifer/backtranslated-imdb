I think a person should be well informed to read or see (I would like to read) "Twelfth Night" before I see or see "She's a man". The movie is good on its own, but comparing both, and looking for in-jokes makes it much more fun. Shakespeare was inspired by others. I think he would give the thumbs up. Harld Bloom said in "Shakespeare, the invention of man" that most people in the "Twelfth Night" must be locked out. Malvolio, on which Malcolm is based, is no good reason. People in "She's a Man" are contrasting sensible. For example, Duke Orsino is far more lion than Duke Orsino. It also shows that a person can feel without being gay. It shows a lot of self-control. It's a teen comedy (clean) so it doesn't have dark edges of the game. For example, Olivia in the game mourns the death of her brother. In the movie, she was dumped. <br /> <br /> If you like Sir Andrew and Sir Toby in the game, they don't have the same attention in the movie. <br /> <br /> Jokes are quite often fast. The surname of the hairdresser Pauls is given once. It's Antonio. Many people who have read the game say Antonio has more love for man than just friendship. Deep love between people was recorded in those days. Some see the sexual side to that-homosexuality was illegal. The only line from the game I caught is where Duke Orsino quotes a coach for size during a football game. The game is called Malvolio, quoting Maria).
