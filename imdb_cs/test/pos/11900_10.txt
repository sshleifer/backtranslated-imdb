This movie was the one I had been waiting for for some time. I was glad I expected everything. Writing this film was so subtly created and explored far beyond the viewers. I found it funny that so many people watching do not read between some very important lines, but if not, the film will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters around this one Kilo, a man who rose from the streets in the midst of many misery and became a very powerful criminal. Having spent some time in the Kilo prison will find a gap in the justice system and through the disturbing turn of events is released just to find everything is not at all what it seems. Kilo finds himself against the higher sphere of society and political copyrights to make it clear how important the Word of Man and its meaning are. The war begins when the street is in the arms of the masters of wealth and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> Build yourself for explosive and powerful, continuous twists and turns. This film lets you rivet. I found that casting this film is excellent and not a movie that should be ignored. Excellent. Go Rent It Today !!
