I am a huge Gone With the Wind fan and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniseries and loved it. This is a continuation of the species. As if you didn't expect it to be, "Honestly dear, I won't give you damn" end. Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though no one ever replaces Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on the other hand, could give Vivien Leigh a run for her money (though I feel almost guilty even though I say so.) Her attitude and presence in the film fits the character on the tee so you love and hate her her at the same time, which is how much she feels about Mrs. Leigh's portrayal. The film moves slowly, mostly because it follows the book so tightly and was not released as a feature film. An excellent choice for the manufacturer. I think this film deserves some appreciation for a great story, the restoration of characters that have been gone for nearly 50 years, and for Margaret Mitchell herself to be proud of them.
