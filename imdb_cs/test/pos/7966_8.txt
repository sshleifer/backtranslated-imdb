Towards the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very effective director who gave us such classic features of the 50s as "To Came From Outer Space", "The Creature From The Black Lagoon" and "Tarantula", merged with the former football star he became the best headliner of blaxploitation films in the 1970s by Fred "The Hammer" Williamson for a few films, producing a friendly, unusual Western "The Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshing, fresh, clever and very entertaining black black version on his 40-year-old movie. Down-at-the-heels private detective yarn. Williamson shows a charming combination of dry, self-deprecating humor and relaxed, carefree self-confidence like Shep Stone, cheap, friendly, and forever in Debt that once Los Angeles cop turned a private investigator. Stone is so hard for the money that he uses the bar as his business office and hardly makes ends meet making penny-ante low-pay minor cases that the police don't want to bother. While beating the tiles for one of these deceptively simple concerts (Stone tries to find a young man hiding somewhere in Hollywood), Stone discovers that he is deep in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal conspiracy that includes the outcast Jesus. mad religious cult, all kinds of hippie dopers, sordid porn ring, invaluable missing golden tip that belonged to the legendary silent movie star, shameful underground drug smuggling operations, and the ever growing number of fresh corpses. While the silly playful, malevolent ingenuity of Robert Altman's masterpiece "The Long Goodbye" or the ghostly pessimism of Arthur Penn with the beautiful undisturbed "Night Moves" is lacking, "Black Eye" still makes a degree as a very successful hip'n 'spin. flip 70 to thriller with mystery suspensions. Arnold's capable direction keeps up the pace that moves on a nice, stable clip, interrupted by sporadic exciting mano-a-mano bare-chested combat scenes, and the excellent use of various LA colors (a neglected abandoned amusement park at the end of the film is particularly effective). The script by Mark Haggard and Jim Martin adds a lot of complicated and often truly surprising plots. And the anticipated line of unpredictable, harsh side characters is an interesting strange game, with especially remarkable turns of Rosemary Forsyth as an alluring, powerful owner of the lesbian model of the agency (Forsyth has the best picture line that boasts Stone she first meets him, "I'm all lots of women "), Teresa Graves" Get Christie's Love "television show fame as Stone is a loyal bisexual girlfriend (the film is casual, nonjudgmental depiction as Foryth's unconventional femme fatale and Graves is equally atypical gal Friday is one of his most powerful assets) , and Bret Morrison, who made the voice of "The Shadow" radio in the 1940s, as a smugly slim porn movie. All in all, he's a modest but sure winner.
