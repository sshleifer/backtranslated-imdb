I saw the film and I am very happy to see the film so different in character and story, such as silly, major American productions. It is a film with a background for young people, as well as for all ages. Unlike some reviews, viewers seem to have split my ratings because the film is very successful anywhere in the world. For example, in the Netherlands he was ranked 3rd. Negative statements must be respected, but one should expect to follow facts. If you have a chance to watch a movie and enjoy it.
