This is a very "true case" movie that brings almost almost in your face. I am a Christian and I liked the film in one way. It had an average act from the main person, and that was a low budget, as you can see clearly. This may be a bit long, but the movie has pretty nice cars that will save it from a lower rating from me. As a Christian film it was pretty good, but maybe a little right in the report. The movie works best on a big screen. * SPOILERS * A battle scene with both brothers can remind you of a battle scene between two brothers in a Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" starring Eric Roberts. * End of spoiler * I give him 7/10.
