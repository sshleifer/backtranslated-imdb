I work as a projector in the cinema and basically watch every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan', I laughed and thought, "Great. Next" Snakes on "Samuel L Jackson". But of course I wanted to see it because of the laughter factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly by referring to the title, the pictures on the promotional ads, and being in the movie Justin Timberlake. I personally loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are going through tough times and are able to get to each other. The story is really moving and sends a big message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it to young viewers because of some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and the true performance of Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and, yes, Justin Timberlake, I suggest you see 'Black Snake Moan'.
