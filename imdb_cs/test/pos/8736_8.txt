I discovered this late night on Turner Classics. I kept saying, "I'll turn it off when it is no longer funny," but I don't have to say I've watched all the way. I'm a drug addict, but I've never HEARD this movie (or if I did it in 1971, I forgot). It's worth watching just for the performance of Goldie Hawn as tart-tongued ing√©nue. Her acting is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they did a Hollywood comedy with a clever script?), But her acting is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie could be, and her later roles, such as Laugh-In and Private Benjamin, are a bit sad. In his later career, he is too far away from the minimalist, ominously entertaining appearance. It's a pleasure to watch young Matthau, the great Bergman and the star support cast, but it's Goldie Hawn that this movie is worth watching again.
