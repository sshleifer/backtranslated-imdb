Visconti's work! I admit I don't know about his work, but I can't imagine his next work overcoming this fabulous film. Last night I watched Death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and I was absolutely impressed by what I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: \ tVisconte's extraordinary footage, especially his love for the long, sluggish shots of the people who ate, swim, walked and contained a significant character passing through this mass of people; a brilliant interpretation of the Visconti film selection; Acting according to principles without exaggerated dialogues and spreading scenes of complexity through facial features alone. It's true: young people who are watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film. a film that could not be produced in 2006. A film whose time lies in the short handfuls of the 1960s and early 1970s, when an artistic license was given to film directors and money men. As many of the recent IMDb commentators have written, this film is long, boring (too small) and pretentious in its judgment. I suppose that according to the standards of Hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. Unfortunately, they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others that they like from those years. Please, if you haven't seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in the film and story from a different time. You will be rewarded.
