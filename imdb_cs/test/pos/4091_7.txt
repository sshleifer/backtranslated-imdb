The film is excellent. Acting, cinematography, directing and music are amazing. It seems to me that the reason many people give the film a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original 1937 version of Ronald Coleman. The movie - for good reason! - provoked an incredible level of commitment. Since talking to people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something similar to the first movie "Starwars" in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is amazing. However, this does not mean that this version is also not worthy. Since the first scene, the 1973 version will catch you. Noise and thunderstorm are fantastic, especially as Shangri La prepares you for peace and the music of Burt Bacharach is beautiful. So - enjoy the 1937 version in all ways. Don't be rid of your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let King Kong of 1935 destroy Peter Jackson this year.
