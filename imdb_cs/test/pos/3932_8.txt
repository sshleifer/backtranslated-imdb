I saw the breathtaking view of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After I saw sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed it a lot more! As I saw in the trailer, one knock I had was convinced the whole city could be "forgotten," but this is a shabby popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint I suppose Paris Hilton touches the wax, or dives, etc., and moans "that's hot" but didn't do it (how could they resist ???). There is no nudity from 2 girls, even though Paris looks great in her underwear! I'm surprised they didn't find a third "hot chip victim" in the movie for some useless nudity that is the norm for this type of movie! I will not mention any spoilers or spoilers, but I will say that Paris and Eliza are going to get right! <br /> <br /> The characters are decent and somewhat sympathetic (not like Cabin Fever, where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace, even though nothing like most horror movies happen in 30 minutes. br /> <br /> I give him 8/10 because it brought good fears and gore and I had low expectations to go into it. If you go with friends who like horror movies, you'll have a good time. Noah
