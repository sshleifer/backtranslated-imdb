This movie is pretty good, actually it's like good wine, it's better the more you watch it. The tempo is very slow for such an octane theme, but cinematography is beautiful and unreal. There is a cool blue shade that "rides" the entire movie. There is also one great performance in the performance of Gabriel Casseus' character "Midget". He is amazing. Why the guy doesn't work more. If the film had better support, he would probably have it.
