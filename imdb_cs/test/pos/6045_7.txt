Jack Webb's film "D.I" was the result of an investigation into the real life of several swamp trainees on the Paris island in the 1950s. As always, Webb, who is a patriot that is, came to the defense just like all his other appearances. Actually, I have crammed this movie according to the 1957 standards. I think it's a good movie that is more owned than real. But again, think about the time period that was made (1957) and what was allowed at that time and told on the film. I've always found Jack Webb to be clean and very loyal. I know many have criticized the film as one-sided and governmental propaganda. If you feel like this, watch 'Full Metal Jacket' with R Lee Ermey. I am a Webb fan and I enjoy the movie for its merits, not accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and held institutions at high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this very strict moral period in this country. Don't be too condemned to Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas
