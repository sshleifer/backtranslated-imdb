Note: I tried not to give away any important twists (or endings), but if you're concerned, think about reading the movie before reading more - Thank you! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the relatively high budget output released by Paramount. The story follows (probably true) exploits the hiway-man Jack Shepard in the 1700's London. He was a locksmith who blackmailed a criminal "thief" into the life of criminals to save his brother's life. After being thief crossed twice, we turn into a Robin Hood-type character and gain the support of the common people. He continues to make leaks from several jails (including the infamous Newgate) as well as take the time to "entertain" many noble ladies. I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was a bit predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the files were very well made and looked realistic. I think Clavell captured London's busy atmosphere in 1700 quite well and I enjoyed its creative use of camera angles. And unlike many films that capture this period, Clavell pulls no punches in showing us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene several people fought for a meat pie that rolled over the dirt on the street). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. I confess that it lacks the beautiful scenery and the basic political commentary that Clavell's next film My Valley (parable of the Vietnam War), but still deserves to be observed or two. It is regrettable that it has never (according to my knowledge) been released on video or DVD.
