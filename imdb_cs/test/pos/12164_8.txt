I have never read much about The Crazy Gang (or even seen it) but about my positive experiences with their contemporaries Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially the great praise of Graham Green from the LIMITED LIMITS ("The funniest English picture that was still made ... can carry a comparison with SECURITY LAST and GENERAL ") - made me to immerse myself in the Bare Bones DVD R2 of this Network and their subsequent film GASBAGS (1941; see below), both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no fanfare. The British Western is a rarity, but the British West Spoof is still rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still about 25 years old). By the way, when I return to the silent classics mentioned by Greene, it seems to me that the film is clearly indebted to GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, he also plays as a variation on the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which was immortalized on screen by Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by the ancient comic and frequent Will Hay Moore Marriott; The Gang actually calls Eileen Bell this name quite a bit, and there is a fun sequence where six of them are going to go to bed and whistle the dwarves song from Disney! Six Comics (three sets of comedy duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) can be the biggest such grouping in the film - though not all of their personalities appear here: my favorites were big Bud Flanagan (looking a bit like Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and moustached, squeaky-voiced Teddy Knox; however, bald Charlie Naughton often took limelight - because he is the one on which others always seemed to marry. Yet it is the Marriott who steals the film from his first scene - where he tries to personify every clerk in a dilapidated ghost town theater; a very young Bernard Lee is also notable as a piece villain. The ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually predicts Abbott and Costello's famous "who's first?" (film, in fact, hinges on many words for his humor - which doesn't necessarily travel, especially at this moment ). However, there are some hilarious sequences - some of which even brought tears to the eyes: the opening scene, where a group of Gangs is liquidated by a group of angry creditors; dressing them as Indians once they hit the Yukon; Gang's fury to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; they all embark on a sleepwalking Marriott to confuse the bad guys (a gag that may owe its origin to the merry mirror sequence of Marx Bros in DUCK SOUP [1933]); a spot-on theatrical sketch that pokes fun on the hoary melodramas; an unbelievable moment when one of the gangs, watched by the villains, rises up a staircase that is part of a painted landscape in the theater; and especially to the end, when the singing band Mounted Police galloped sometimes so slowly to Gang's rescue (despite being strained by the increasingly impatient Ranger hero). The thin soundtrack and the crazy nature of the gag itself made it difficult to get all the jokes from time to time - subtitles would certainly be welcome in this case. Crazy Gang made only five films - the first two were also well regarded, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF'S BUTTON AFLOAT (1938) and much later reunion (although Allen had bowed until that time) for ill health and was replaced by Eddie Gray) called LIFE IS CIRCUS (1960; directed by Val Guest, who, by the way, wrote both Gang movies I purchased as well as some of the above-mentioned Hay and Askey vehicles!).
