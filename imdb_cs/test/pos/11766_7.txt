It's not your ordinary movie, but it's good. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie as he speaks what he says, etc. I was a little surprised to see it because I thought it was a normal comedy but it was more than that. He had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. Favorite Part: Probably when Billy Bob runs around in his rippers' robe
