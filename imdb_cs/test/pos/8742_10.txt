Phrases, moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. Benicio del Toro is clearly a good guy, morally clean and inviolable. His counterpart in the BBC's original, Fazal Farmer turned to the dealer, is realistically flawed and clashed over his fate. Both tireless policemen are similarly different. They get our hearts in that American. In the original BBC, they are over-eager, almost obsessed. The best moment for me in Soderbergh was when a college student rhetorically asked Czar drug, "what would you do if you are poor and black and wealthy white people come to your neighborhood and look for drugs?" This point was suggested throughout the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech. Both are great, but the BBC tower over the remake. My conclusion after seeing both shows is that vendors are innocent pawns who only supply demand, and that is the demand that causes so much suffering.
