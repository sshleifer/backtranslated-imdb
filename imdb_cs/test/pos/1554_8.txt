I also saw this film at the film festival, but unlike the previous poster, I found it interesting and original. In the sea of ​​terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad to small budgets and bad behavior, but A.W.O.L is a tense little thriller that hearkens back to "outside limits." Performances are solid, not that Morse or McGinley expects anything else, and the direction is sharp and money. Personally, I find it difficult to reconcile the previous comments with the movie I saw. A.W.O.L is quite aptly written by Shane Black, who, as is usually the case, plays with a genre that pays tribute to crushing stories while winking at viewers and never taking it too seriously. All in all, A.W.O.L proves to be a very well done and entertaining movie.
