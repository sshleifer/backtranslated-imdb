It's not too bad to enter the series, heavily charged with war propaganda, but I enjoy being honest with Rathbone & Bruce. It's more of a fantastic story from start to finish, how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty Independently) recovered the Dancing Men's Code so fast it was Amazing Watson - so why were you not impressed! The post-explanatory bomb / magnifier shocked me, it was just a kind of cheap Universal trick to play - reminding me again that they didn't expect people to watch it critically 60 years later. This (and I think that every other Universal potboiler in this period) was to be seen once or twice and forgotten. Perhaps they should realize that people basically do not change, that what they did to ordinary people in 1942 would still enjoy the selected group (2005) and tighten the script and the files! Lionel Atwill went through his rape case in Hollywood about this time, wondering if it was an effective make-up that made him look as sharp as Moriarty? An important thing about SW is that it was the first Holmes movie Roy William Neill directed, I think he drove the rest and produced everything but one, creating amazing ambient continuity.
