"Head" is a film that kept well from its original release date in 1968. The film is a total contradiction with the Monkees' painting. Presents Monkees as their fans never saw them; men with real thoughts. Monkees, completely controlled by their producers, was given the opportunity to tell their story. The film boasts fun in their image, entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack includes some of their best music. It's a movie that's worth seeing over and over again.
