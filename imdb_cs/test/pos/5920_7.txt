"In 1927 a young man, alone in a single-engine plane, flew from Roosevelt, New York non-stop from across the North Atlantic to Le Bourget Field in Paris, three thousand six hundred and ten million triumphs of mind, body and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh influenced the lives of everyone on earth - in 33 hours and thirty minutes of flight age became a reality, that is the story of this flight. Strengthened by the strong performance of James Stewart (the pilot himself) as Lindberg, which includes an intelligent scenario by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis is an honestly well-narrated story. What occasionally threatens to become a monotonous movie, Wilder keeps it ticking through using flashbacks to Lindbergh's life. Yet Nungesser and Coli are missing (they will never find) while trying the same trip in the opposite direction, learning things like when they came to buy their first plane and its working with a flying circus. All this is in relation to the understanding of man and his obvious passion for flying. This also helps us to get a complete picture of Lindbergh, and so he with us in his isolated cockpit as he sets out on this dangerous journey. Combat isolation (his only company is a fly) and chronic fatigue, here Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's commitment to the task. With the amazing score from Franz Waxman and the nomination for the Academy Award nominated by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's film appears to be an engaging story of human interest that has earned a thorough professional production. 7/10
