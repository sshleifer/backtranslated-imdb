My friend gives me these three huge boxes. "They're laserdiscettes of Flash Gordon series," he says. "I'll have some giant coasters," I say. But not so. This serial rocks. (But I had to whimper and moan almost anyone I knew to find a laser player for me). There's a lot of things in this series: There are lion men, hawks, shark-men, Earthmen, and I think you'd call Mongo-men. Kits and costumes combine Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian, and there are armor like the English Knight. Great costumes. And some of it was a rebellion. Those terrible tights with shorts over em that wear Zarkov are off the label. And the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers. It's so funny as they renamed the octopus to octosacka, the orangutan to the orangapoid and the tiger to the tiger. There is also a dragon (a Godzilla-like being threatened by lightning on several occasions before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like the Invisible Man? You got this. Do you like sword fighting, wrestling (animals and men), fist fighting? Plenty of taste. We have the underwater city, the sky, the city on the top of the mountain, and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey effects? Massive amounts. The city of heaven is supported by radio ovens that are lit like old steamers. Rocketships are "powered" by fireworks and have constant backups and / or buzzing sounds. Lots of wires are visible, holding things up (like food when Flash was invisible and of course rockets). There are clouds in the universe, but nothing around the Earth viewed from Monga. "Giant" lizards appear briefly. The fight against sea creatures is reportedly threatening Flash & co. on the way to the underwater city of sharks. "Gadgets" in dr. And they seem to be the same no matter what lab he is in (he worked in Ming's lab and Vultan's). And yeah, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultane, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) not just the person she would prefer. In fact, it seems that a lot of parcels are about Princess Aura's intrigue to try to win Flash. I think the characters are awesome. The King Vultan, who laughed, was sad. It was pure art as he mastered these wings. A Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They were supposed to have him as Emperor in Starwars. Ming must be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was also a bit small. And she pulled him off nicely. I think he's a better actress than Dale Arden. Even the tricky priest had a special role. Zarkov was a good but not the strongest character --- and always stood in the background during the battle scenes that held Dale. Now we get to Flash: Flash, of course, was a strong point, a leader, a hero --- and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fits him perfectly. After seeing it, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. Watch this, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you've ever considered watching an old series (or any series), it should be your first choice. The only reason I didn't give this is 10 stories that could be easily resolved as the giant lizards seemed to be, and a few weak characters (the king of shark men and the lion king).
