That was it! I'd never expect the end if I didn't know the backstage stuff yet. One thing I hated was why Shannon was dropped, not Alyssa. I hate her that her character would rather die, Shannon. what was funny is that in the scene where the pacifier dies in a hospital bed and Prue cried side by side, I started crying too lol. at the time that this aired I was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I told myself if she dies, then I won't see the show again! lol <br /> <br /> then comes back the thing that was shocking and really good. Also blame Pheobe for Prue's death because instead of having her sister be slutty bi *** and be good with her for a friend's demon. but I think this episode will now and forever be one of my favorites and classic CHRMED. FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed!
