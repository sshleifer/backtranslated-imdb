This is the movie is about one of the best I've seen so far. I'd like it to be just the second on All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same vibration ... "9 souls" are about 9 prisoners who just escaped from prison to find some counterfeit money stored at the time of the capsule on Mount Fuji Elementary School. Later, he discovers that he was not there and went on his own. the first half of the movie is just time for the characters to be presented and the main points to be given. it is a comic but serious part of the journey. the other half shifted to tears. as the film goes on, each character goes and tries to fulfill his dreams, but unfortunately ends somewhat wrong. at the end, only 2 out of 9 refugees will remain. the way each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. beautiful movie directed fantastically. it is a movie for people who enjoyed other Toshiaki Toyoda movies, such as "Blue Spring".
