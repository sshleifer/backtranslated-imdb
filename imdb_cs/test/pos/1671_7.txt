As far as I am concerned, this film noir, unlike film noir, which I am used to watching, has two completely different things: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - There is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. Both films will make some unique, at least English-speaking, noir fans. The film was actually made by American Jules Dussain, so it's not a completely European film. Initially, I was disappointed after watching the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, as soon as the silent segment began - a real robbery (you already know what it is), the film has risen considerably and was better and better. In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the film was cinematography. This is what makes the disk worth owning. It's an excellent film noir photo and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and that's Paris in the mid-1950s. There's a lot of dreary, but interesting, rain-soaked Parisian streets and buildings I've fascinated. In fact, there were a lot more of those great shots than in London in the much better known film, The Third Man. The main actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is, also interesting to show. Someone has described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that is a perfect summary. Warning for those who do not expect profanity or nudity in classic film. This is France, not the United States, so here's a little both. I also appreciate the DVD that offers a subtitle selection or a dubbed version.
