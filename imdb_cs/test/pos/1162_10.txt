This is one of my favorite favorites. All the actors do a great job. Comparing this film to "Lawrence of Arabia" does not mean the fairness of both films. "The Wind and the Lion" is a much lower budget with fantastic actors showing pleasing characters in a pleasing atmosphere. There are also action and beautiful pictures that guarantee my favorite movie together.
