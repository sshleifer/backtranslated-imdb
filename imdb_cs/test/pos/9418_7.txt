This morning I watched two very different Holmes adventures, but you would be amazed by the similarities. It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I Was King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It wasn't their first Sherlock Holmes adventure as they did a few years before. Great team, but I prefer Hammer, which I will talk about later. Holmes relies on a lot of disguise to do his job, and I'm constantly amused by the mannerisms that emerge when he thinks up something. They always seem to jump when they find a new guide. The story of how to keep the bomb from the Germans in World War II was interesting and focused on the mystery.
