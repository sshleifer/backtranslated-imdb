Stylish, provocative, cool and breathtaking? only four aspects of the film, which long remains in the viewer's thoughts. The slow pace can be at the beginning, but the director enchants with a beautiful camera, sophisticated compositions and elegant cuts. The unfolding story, not so much the narrative line, but the revelation of the inner self of the characters, is masterful. Olivia Magnani, who plays Sophia, the hotel's receptionist, who finally breaks down the reserve of the former consort Titta di Girolami (Tony Servillo) is coldly beautiful and reveals the hidden depths and personal honesty in her short but profound relationship with Girolami. A middle-aged Mafia man, forced to live in an empty life, troubled by insomnia, in a Swiss hotel, finds himself in similarly empty lives of a sophisticated elderly couple who previously owned the hotel, but is now forced to live there as residents afterwards what her husband played his resources a few years ago. My husband constantly dreams of restoring his lost wealth and making a great statement to the world. His wife realizes it's just a pipe dream. This nicely contradicts the resignation of Girolami, who does not see the way out and seeks it. The fleeting affair between Girola and Sofia has consequences that no one could have foreseen. This allows him to escape from prison without bars, but to pay a huge price he willingly accepts, thus giving redemption to an older couple.
