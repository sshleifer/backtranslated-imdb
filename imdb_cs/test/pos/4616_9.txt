At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. It is not shown who took their lives or reasons, time jumps back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six individual students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Every student is struggling with his own moral dilemmas, all reach the boiling point, hit one end. After losing a friend to suicide and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer / director Murali K. Thalluri created a reetting drama focused on teen life and a terrible act of suicide. Suicide was a theme that was kept in shadow, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring light. If you have been affected by the act of suicide or by anyone who has, 2:37 becomes harder to see. With a heavy and hard topic, Thalluri also deals with the daily life crises of adolescents. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri is very realistic. The factor for Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respects his subject and the problems that everyone has ever suffered. He sometimes approaches documentary film, has such painful realism; Interviews with each film-related character only enhance this. 2:37 has a strong resemblance to Gus Van Sants Elephant. While the core of each film is different, they both deal with teen life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking images, with time to jump back and forth to show the interactions of individual characters from different angles. The decisive point for Elephant was its ethereal atmosphere. With free conversation, little character development, and long tracking footage, Sant created a terrifying and fascinating atmosphere of upcoming fear. While there is this fear at 2:37, the emotional connection with the characters reaches a higher level that Sant could not achieve. As time goes by, each character becomes fragile, pulling you along its emotional path on wheels. The real hit of this movie is the inevitable suicide that was predicted at the outset. The hard part about this scene is complete interference and the discomfort we have as an audience watching someone's life ends up in horrible fashion. Though many films that have shown suicide, glamor on the act or romanticize the act. Thalluri shows the pain and suffering associated with this act and it is not the best solution. With the unknown in the lead and their first major role; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and a promising acting career.
