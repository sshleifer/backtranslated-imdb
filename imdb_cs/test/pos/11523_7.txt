An interesting film with Jordana Brewster as a young woman who travels to Europe to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), who mysteriously died years ago. Brewster is very good and keeps you in spite of some unrealistic conspiracy, such as surprisingly finding her and starting romance with her dead sister's much older friend (Christopher Eccleston). Still, mostly good. GRADE: B
