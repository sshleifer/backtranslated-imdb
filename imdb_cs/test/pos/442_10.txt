This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. It's a story about how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see workers who jumped on site to begin construction and training dancers. Finally, the dizziness of the opening night and the long sequence of the Cancan dance. Financial problems and examples of ego performers are described. Gabin is in great shape as easily accessible by Danglard - you can see how humorous he works with humorous friend Nini. Gianni Esposito moves like a stupid prince who cares for Nini. Maria Felix, with the amazon's body, is impressive as the egoistic Lola, Danglard's first mistress. Finally, Françoise Arnoul as Nini, a dying girl who ends up dancing for Danglard and becomes his girlfriend, is simply overwhelming; her charm and charming charm will win you. Bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in star portraits a century ago who ruled the Moulin Rouge.
