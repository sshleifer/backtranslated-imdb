I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London Film Festival. Structurally it was compared to Pulp Fiction, but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the weaker mood of Kevin Smith's officials. Four stories intersect at a French highway dinner. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) staying in the dining room. Waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) apologizes and tells her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from a wealthy family. Unfortunately, she is suicidal for her and her family probably doesn't want to go back. The third is the dialogue between the two aging rock stars who bust into the restaurant (Alain Bashung and Arno themselves). The last part is about four former criminals who smuggle their old partner out of the hospital to visit their old hiding place, which has since changed to? in restaurant. "Epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more of a conclusion). The structure doesn't really work. Stories are not intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. Even the dinner important for the event is at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of each story varies. The Hiding Story is a cute idea, with a few good gags, but it doesn't look; and the reunion of a rock star is nonsensical and boring. On the other hand, the kidnapping story is merry, though its connection to the dining room is weak. The most balanced and successful story is Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entirely successful, but it has interesting and fun moments. I look forward to further work by Samuel Benchetrit.
