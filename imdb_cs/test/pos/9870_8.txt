... don't like this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is bad, as is acting. But in my opinion, it's better than Halloween 5, although it doesn't give many surprising moments. Several scenes are really well controlled. But those few moments give no reason to rent. I hate violence in movies, but H6 presents extremely powerful and bloody scenes that don't match the tradition of Halloween movies. Most sucking aspect about H6 is lack of tension. No comparison to the first masterpiece. Halloween 6 gets only 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But don't expect a great horror experience .... <br /> <br />
