"Dead Man Walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. All actions are high-end and realistic, and the scenario examines the issue of death penalty on both sides, both of whom I believe in. Above all, it is a deeply moving story of redemption, death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that boldly and clearly tackles it with such an incredibly difficult theme deserves a rating of 10/10. Thank you, Tim Robbins!
