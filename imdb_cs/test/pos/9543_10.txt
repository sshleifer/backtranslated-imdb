I avoided this movie as a kid because I thought it would be boring? No fighting or shooting, cops, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not a great movie. So I didn't see TRC until I was 20 and I didn't find one of the most beautiful, captivating movies I saw. All the actors add a characteristic and every emotion is drawn by the viewer. Filming and directing are deceptively simple, but they feel so natural and drag me into the story. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the station platform near the end, driven and perfected. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls, "Dad! My dad!' keys emotion from the viewer. Tears are well reflected in my eyes as I think about it. This adaptation is not just a film, it is a piece of precious art, but it is also a perfect example of what all filmmakers should be. strives to achieve an emotional experience.
