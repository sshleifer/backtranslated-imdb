Anyone who has doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy has to look at the "Bells of Our Lady". OK, so there is a nun with TB who is probably in love with Fr. O'Malley, (I think Luis Bunuel could do that), but she also showed an amazingly sad sense of fun that led you to make directors more often into comedies. In the "Cactus Flower" is a nurse who is a dentist (Walter Matthau is a dentist) in love with her boss, but keep her on. When she is forced to act as his "wife" to cover up her mistress, (don't ask), she lets herself relax and buttons pop.

Hawn was so impressed that what she did was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
