Over the years, I became a fan of Barry Levinson's director / writer and didn't let me with this very funny look at politics. The popular television comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has enlightened the nation with his witty jokes about the state of the country and elected politicians. Night after night, his fans roll in the islands; then it is suggested that Dobbs stand for the president himself. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says it. Dobb's shy shy flames grass-root movement that puts him on the ballot. Comedian to the President. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a mistake in a computer system that will calculate coastal voting. My favorite sequence is the collapse of Linney in a cafe. Other notes in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
