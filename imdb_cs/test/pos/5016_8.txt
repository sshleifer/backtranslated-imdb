stuey unger was a legend playing card. He was quoted in an interview as saying, "Some day, I suppose it's possible for someone to be a better No Limit Hold'em player than me." I doubt it, but it could have happened. I don't see how anyone could play gin better than me. "In this movie, there is a gin rummy scene that is so amazing that you could throw it into" X-Men "as a showcase of mutant superhero power. That's how incredible this man was. <br /> <br /> I have a couple minor issues with this movie. as dark as this movie, stuey's real life was darker. poker for todd brunson said, "During the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I had a drink and talked about Stu. Mike told us how he could barely speak, didn't shower in weeks, and how his fingers were. fired a black slit. â€œIn the movie Michael Imperioli, he looked too healthy to be studied in the last years of his life. when stuey prevailed in his last wsop, he looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, this production lacked both time and deniro to make this kind of transformation. my other problem was that I wanted more poker games with real hands and situations. Certainly it could bore the average enthusiast without poker, but it would be nice. too bad a film was not 6 hours or longer. I watched a movie with 3 players who didn't have poker, and everyone enjoyed it. just as you don't have to be a former colonial army member to enjoy Gibson's "patriot", you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem. can not wait for DVD.
