Relatively effective horror / science fiction and la "Alien" is quite well done due to its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well-stimulated action sequences adequately correct cracks in a rather tedious dialogue. When the spacecraft falls to a distant planet, the bereaved will soon realize that terrible terror is waiting in the darkness of the coming total eclipse.
