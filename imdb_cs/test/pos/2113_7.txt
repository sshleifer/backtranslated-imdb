We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family movie with many fun portraits. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film, as well as turns the famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is particularly cute in the movie, but all the kids are good. The western scenery of Texas is great, as well as a soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit appealing to me, but my son was interested in a movie that wasn't that often. Something in the story was charming for the kids. When I showed calves as a child, I liked the end. This is definitely not the way it really works unless you have a heifer.
