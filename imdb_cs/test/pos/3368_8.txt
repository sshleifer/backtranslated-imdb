I wasn't sure what to expect from BOX. I am a huge Darko fan, but I also saw a mess that became Southland Tales, whether it was a studio studio, who knows. I was pleasantly surprised with the box. It was a return to the classic sci-fi paranoid films that suggest much more insidious events, but focus on the intimate character base. Slow building and spooky tension was very effective for the tone and motive. the whole film. Any change in such stimulation would lead to a typical Hollywood style or "MTV" that would not be the proper purpose of this story. Everything from strange and acting extras that sprawled around the world to a low score, to a minimal explanation of what's going on, added a whole focused thread of basic horror and a diminishing sense of hope for our greed, though well-meaning, the leader characters. It was something well thought out and set in motion by Richard Kelly, from the first meeting to the end. Richard Matheson's short story, based on it, is not the Twilight Zone ep, which was another story of the story, was morality and greed that were still central to the BOX. Being only about 8 pgs long, expanding it into a feature with the substance would be not an easy task, but was done so with style, originality and leaves the viewer with persistent thoughts on the film. Many of them do it with DARKO and compare it to whether or not it is so deep, but I found it to be a completely different film, thematically and emotionally. It's a totally different tone, just like the news and intentions of this movie. Where Darko left us with questions internally, BOX leaves the viewer with other external questions that relate to the world around us. If he knew human nature, would the BOX test ever be terminated? Decent behavior, great fearsome visualization and approaching atmosphere contribute to slow driving. It's not for everyone, but for those who get to where it is from its goodness.
