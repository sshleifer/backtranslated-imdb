Campfire Stories (1997) <br /> <br /> Excellent work peace. Everything about this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast as you can see from IMDb. The reason I brought the movie was Christine Taylor and the love of horror. Allows you to get into the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. There are 4 Teenagers in this movie, After crashing your car they decide to say some spooky stories 2. There are 3 stories and the main storyline (4 teenagers are the main plot) 3. The best story is "people can lick too" in my opinion. the least frightening story is maybe a "honeymoon" or a second story (can't remember the name "<br /> <br />" "people can lick too" is about a man pretending to be a 13 year old girl (via the internet) starts chatting with a girl named Amanda and then enters her house, which is very scary stuff. The only bad part of this movie is, teenagers crash their car into another couple, but kids don't bother to see if the couple is okay. They just talk about the couple that I came across. The men and women who made this film scared people, not to make money, unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this film is made to frighten you. "and" I know what you did last summ er "were made to be vel Although this movie wasn't pushed as publicly as shouting was, it's still 10 times better than screaming and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are great and have realistic features. The cast that plays these characters is great. Christine Taylor does a great job with Lauren, doesn't go top with acting. Dude who plays Eric (laurens younger brother) also does a good job of showing men or teen boys can also get mad out. The screams are like a spoof movie, the killer is a joke, and the kids are stupid. be more observed.
