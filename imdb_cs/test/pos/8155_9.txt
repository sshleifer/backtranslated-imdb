Hey, this movie's about elections. All the times in your life you have to pick something or it just goes away ... And this film proves it! Of course, life is not really like a beautiful picture of how this movie shows ... it doesn't really show, but some can figure it out. I'm trying to say it's full of pain, love and deep lessons to live. Aaron, Mormon's missionary is a true shepherd who digs what's beautifully deep inside Chisthian, the guy with a skin feeling ... <br /> <br /> It's a great ending and you always believe in fate because it will surprise you or another of your live life, such as Days of the Last Days ... <br /> <br /> Big problem!
