I watched it again after I didn't see it because it first came out (in 97), and it still made me laugh aloud. It's cleverly written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not laugh, you're more than a man than me. For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to "How to be a Man" tape and the post (almost) wedding scene with Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes Every movie. Sure, the last scene is a little excuse for a happy ending, but ... a few movies are perfect.
