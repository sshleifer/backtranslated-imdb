I once commented on this Chucky, but I had to do it again to say something about the film when I first saw it on a large balcony in a big theater. The movie was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky movie in the theater, and it was a special moment for me because I respected Chucky. Other horror bad guys are referred to GREAT COOLNESS !!! And the bitch was shocking! The scene where the gay man packed was amazingly cheerful! This was a great gore scene !!!!! And the end was so bizarre and shocking that it took me with *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​having Chucky's seeds was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I loved it and I couldn't believe it was real. The bizarre and diverse qualities of this installment of this children's game have made me for some reason a sign like Jason Goes To Hell from the Children's Play series. It was just such a shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. Certainly ***** from *****. Here's how I rank serials: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not as much as the original Holland's classic. I can't wait for Seed of Chucky! Bring it!
