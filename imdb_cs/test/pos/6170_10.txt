Since adolescence in Czechoslovakia, I have watched the history of RAF pilots and crews in World War II, their stories and tragic endings either in combat or communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, though the fact that those brave men we are able to go through all this and to restore is amazing. All the people who want to see a great movie ... this is one! During a recent visit to the Czech Republic, I have seen this film three times in three days (we only play it for three days ... otherwise I will see it several times !!! I hope you will enjoy it, though it requires a little more thinking and background information Behind the story, pretty much the same way as the movie "Kolya." It's not a simple movie because it's a deep story, and the way his narration most likely causes you to cry ... he made it three times in a row. .. Zdeněk Sverak has always done a great script, his son Jan made a great movie and cast - undoubtedly everyone did a great job, I was impressed by Ondrej Vetchy, the great role of Oldřich Kaiser and all the other actors who simply made this movie !!! Oscar nomination, I think I'll be a Hollywood strike.
