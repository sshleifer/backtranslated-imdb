Another nice fun Warner. I really liked John Garfield, though I wonder why Cagney wasn't in the role. Maybe it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I think it's another story of Dead End Kids, but I also appreciated it very much and this movie had a lot of nice comic touches along with some serious drama. Boys work with Garfield. Nice succession was the whole "swimming" scene, which starts without worries, but ends up too close to the catastrophe. One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly wrong. As a detective, the gentle actor looked like a nun in a little girl.
