"Cherry" tells of a naive, free virgin who decides to have a baby but is not quite sure how to go about it. This easy sleep is full of quirky characters and situational humor. Fresh, fun, breaking things, I really enjoy this movie ... for what it's worth. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedies who want something else.
