As is the case with many of the films of this illusion, my non-Catholic style has come in the way of my understanding. The Church has this number of rules that have been compiled over the centuries. We have a short time to learn and accept them at face value. Then throw some evil people to avenge the long distant action against them, work these rules and try to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I wondered, "That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?" In Robert Langdon's character, this casual thing, no matter what the problem, seems to always make the right first step. I suppose it's like watching a CSI where it solves incredibly complex cases within a few days. They know the location of the country. There is so much land in this film and so little time to understand everything that is happening. But if you create Robert Langdon, you have to set it to work. It's okay because heroic idiots like him saved the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought Da Vinci's code was funny too. Interesting and not as bad as people thought. It's a miracle you can look at and don't stop for a while.
