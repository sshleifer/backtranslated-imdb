I first saw "Signs of Life" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It is a beautifully written, ensemble production with amazing performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofria as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is coming. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives remarkable clarity and essence to their characters. <br /> <br /> The direction is soft and efficient. Over the years I have watched this movie several times and would recommend it. Beautiful piece of film.
