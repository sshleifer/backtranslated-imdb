I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some excerpts from the dialogue: Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "Do you see the man at the well drawing water? When one bucket is emptied, the others will fill" Is it so with the world. You are currently full of power. But you spill it, waste it. And Islam lapped the drops as they pour out of your bucket. "Raisuli: The English paid very well in the past. Pedecaris: Well, you won't have a way with the Americans. President Roosevelt will have a head on it. Raisuli: Roosevelt, this president Roosevelt - he tried to take it himself Pedecaris: Yes, it is a man with gravel and a strong moral thread He kidnaps women and children Raisuli: What kind of rifle does Pedecaris: Winchester! Raisuli: Winchester Winchester. I don't know about this rifle Pedecaris: You'll be. Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): The American grizzly bear is a symbol of American character: strength, intelligence, fury, a little blind and sometimes ruthless, but courageous. The Newspaper Reporter: And that, Mr. President? Teddy Roosevelt: Loneliness. The bear lives alone. Untamed. Misunderstood. But always alone. He has no real allies, only enemies - but none of them Not as big as he is, a newspaper reporter: Do you feel that this can be an American trait? Teddy Roosevelt: Sure. The world will never love us. He can respect us. He may even fear us. But he will never love us. Because we have too much courage. And sometimes we are a little blind and unscrupulous.
