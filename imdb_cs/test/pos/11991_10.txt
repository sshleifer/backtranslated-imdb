I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage, which is an unfair continuation that is just unfair. Because I really think it should have a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey everyone was all who should put up and then a little dancing beam and that is the end of Caddyshack, even though the film ranking was (R) and the other one (PG) was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
