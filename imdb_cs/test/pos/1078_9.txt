Business vs. Business personal beliefs. Profit vs. art. As with any document that builds capitalist large corporations against a small manufacturer, the viewer will always have to take the side of one or the other based on his own beliefs. It is a documentary about a new standardized way in which globalization has brought us, against the old traditional ways in which the character and the art of doing things matter more than selling the product. If you want to remember one thing from this movie, it's that the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they just follow the taste of one or several critics who tend to balance and standardize their taste the same way they do used MacDonalds. Do it for a quick bite (something Parker himself admits in the movie against the background of Burger King sign). "It's all about the picture" against the content, as another interviewee says. This is an easy way, a standardized way. Easier than taking your time for a nice wine to mature, easier than creating your own taste by trying and trying again. Controlled brand taste is easier. There is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins ​​across the ocean agree that several people "balancing" the taste of wine to maximize profits and ensure the maximum out of it is sold to the "gray masses". Individuality and the difference is sacrificed for an extra buck. It's nice to see that not everything or everyone is putting on standardization, even across the ocean. As in many other areas of today's world, few and limited freedom of choice dominate us. ... let everyone decide and decide what to go for. Too much standardization kills mind and taste; the difference brings innovation and healthy competition and allows choice - and not just vacuum-packed "more of the same". Standardization is sold easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - lower. <br /> <br /> I am going to open a nice bottle here and wish you a cordial sante.
