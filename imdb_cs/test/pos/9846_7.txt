Great James Cagney, top-billed, won't appear until the second third of the movie and probably has less screen time than Dudley Digges, who plays eee-vill reform-school potentate. But when Jimmy arrives, as deputy commissioner of something-or-elsewhere to reform reform schools, he knocks down air with his hands and jumps on his feet balls and spits out the punchy Warners-first national dialogue with all the usual, and expectations, panache. Psychology in this stark antique, one of Warner's many efforts to assert its place as a "socially conscious" studio, does not fall deep: Digges is bad just because the script requires it to be, and there is a curious idea that juvenile delinquents will turn into swollen children if they have little autonomy. But it's made in this replacement, fast-paced style that the studio has specialized in and never gets bored. Frankie Darro, who has encountered various problems on the screen during his short term, is the most popular JD - a handsome, charismatic pug fighter and a hate look that could cripple steel. No actor can touch him today.
