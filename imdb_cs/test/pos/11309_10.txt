This is one of Julie's greatest tribute to music, along with her "Trapped in the White Girl's Body" album. To quote the great Medusa "Dare to go bare, just wear underwear, get a ride home every time" - Wow! It's good advice now. "You can dance, to my party! Yeah, excuse your dancing shoes! ..... You are invited to a party in my pants. Yeah, go to the boys, let's dance, to the party in my pants" Julie Brown is cheerful !! ! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is amazing !!!
