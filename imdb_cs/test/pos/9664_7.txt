Not a bad movie, but playing and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is in good shape like the one in the movie. it's hard for a lost generation to get a life in Romania and 90 percent of us choose something else and that something else involves dealing with people with "bad habits" if you understand me, but that comes with the territory. This movie represents me and I like it. I am angry in me that even barley talk to people, I live in a mess of society and I can't fit in and I don't want to, and that's the story of the movie as well, if you r like me you can understand the real movie, if not, you'll find it's easy and cheap.
