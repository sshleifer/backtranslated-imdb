Crimson starts with some great jazz music, so I liked it right away, but as the film was wearing, I wondered if the music was the best. We have several thieves pulling a precious robbery, and when someone does something wrong, the alarm goes off and the cops chase them and when the car turns on the road block, one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whatever it is here) shot . It looks like he could die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his friend madly a scientist (and wife) is saved, with part of the nightclub owner's brain called "Sadist." Sadist is unhappy in the fact that the gentlemen who kidnapped him lost the knife to remove him, it is the head to add insult to injury (or, in this case, death), remove the head by train and leave the body to authorities. Find Oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to devastate every woman who comes near him because he now has the thinking of his donor. Well, of course, this is quite unlikely and features medical equipment that seems to have been purchased at Radio Shack, and overall it's pretty cheesy and sleazy. But it has a good start and impression of the 70s and music is great. This is not so much a horror movie, but a more thriller with lots of robbers battling it over lawn and babes and other things like a robber, but it's weirdly fun ways that I can't begin to describe. 7 out of 10.
