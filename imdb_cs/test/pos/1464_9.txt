The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that only aired was at least up to zero with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at "My Maisonette". I hope this will keep the good work of 'faux terribles' on my television. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of "alternative comedy" (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think too much about another.) Comedians on TV today. overboard. Even from his brief stint at Nathan Barley, I knew Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure he would be great as Dixon Bainbridge in The Mighty Boosh. In the spirit of these programs, I also felt that it was necessary to expand our ratings to ensure that this public domain was available.
