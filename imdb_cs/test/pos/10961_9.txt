Watching John Cassavet's debut is a strange experience, even if you have seen improvisational films before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is roughness. Immediately, it is clear that some characters compare their lines. But then you return from the situation when you delve deeper into the intimate exchanges of these people and ask yourself, "Do I ever stumble over MY words?" Of course, the answer is certain. It is unfortunate that most gaffs are coming to the picture soon in this regard, because in about twenty minutes you have plunged so deeply into yourself that you wouldn't have known if a bomb had come to you. Another thing you'll notice ... or you may notice that hours or days after the movie ends is that you've never seen any substantial conspiracy, but the themes and poetry of dialogue and the characters of you they never leave. In fact, the treatment of the role the race plays in the daily lives of these characters is always, but it is so ephemeral that they do not even realize how they inform their opinions about themselves, their consciousness, their perceived state, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you have a full spectrum of black, white and gray ... and not just skin pigmentation. Leila Goldoni (really noteworthy) is an African-American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African-Americans. Ironically, they exist in what is undoubtedly the "most beautiful" atmosphere of the day ... rhythmically driven Upper East West Manhatten ... and there are still conflicts inside and around. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such a fine van or technique. It's a lot like absorbing a really great art gallery and then you just nod in bliss when you think you'll return to the paintings that evoked days later. Great Championships and Accessories on Criterion. Probably the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
