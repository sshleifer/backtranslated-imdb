Its very hard to portray Tagore's novel along cinematographic lines. And if you forget the obscure 1967 production, then it's the first time Chokher has been doing it on a large scale. Overall suits seemed fantastic with the right touches for making a successful season of drama.Prasenjit, so used to making crass commercial things made a good effort. I saw the Bengali version and found that Aishwariya's voice was dubbed, making her delivery delivery a bit poor. While the director did a good job with every character with subtlety, it was in the sense that her story was very little, probably a lack of the story itself. The hardest point.Its hard to do some Tagore stories into movies, as only the visual parts seem to have realized.
