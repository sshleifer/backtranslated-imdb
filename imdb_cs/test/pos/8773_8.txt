I am a massive Hitchcock fan since I saw the "Back Window" on TV. "Saboteur" is not the best Hitchcock for me, it's a very good but not a masterpiece. He has his mistakes, some parts are rather slow and as a result of being written off in a hurry, the scenario felt rather incomplete. But Hitchcock's direction is excellent and the performances were not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane have a good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the show. The story is good, about a poor man on the run, very similar topics used in "39 steps" and "northwest", and cleverly provides some of the necessary leaks. The music score was excellent; the opening title sequence music was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the excavations in Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Cinematography is also sharp and smooth, the scenery and landscape almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. Namely the culmination of the Statue of Liberty, but the encounter with the circus ensemble and the warm-up of Radio Music City Hall is also on the money. Overall, Hitchcock isn't the best, but it's definitely worth a look. Bethany Cox
