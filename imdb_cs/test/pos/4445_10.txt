"Don't Torture and Duckling" is one of the best Italian horror movies I've ever seen and I saw my share. Calling it giallo is a bit misleading because it's not really a mysterious secret of murder. It is rather a direct horror movie. Complete with one of the most brutal and bloodiest scenes in the movie that was in the old movie, Fulci's twisting and rotating film radiates with a spooky atmosphere and old school feel in Italian. The setting is ideal: an old Italian village. Music is ridiculously perfect. The final is original and original. After you see "Don't Torture and Duckling", you really have to wonder how Fulci's later things got so out of the beat. I like all his stuff, but he strayed. Maybe he thought he'd done it ... Because with this movie, he hits the bullseye. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks Dario Argento owns the giallo genre. Fulci beats him this. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
