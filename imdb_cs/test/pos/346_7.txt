'' Meet Sherri .. for Pleasure and Terror! '' Cheap Special Effects, Cheese Lines, Yep's Original 1978 Movie '' Sister Sherri '' Begins Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond, and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and directed by Al Adamson. The film is about a bad ancient spirit that has a sister in the hospital, then gradually kills the doctor. The meeting was fine, but some of the actors were robotic. The story was good but the sex scenes were just thrown there probably getting more views.The director was bad, And special effects looked like drawing, the effects were not crazy anybody. it made no sense as sex scenes, nudity, footballer, and many more. Overall, it's a good movie, but not the best. > <br /> 7 out of 10
