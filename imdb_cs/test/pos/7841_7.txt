"The Beguiled" is a strange work between Clint Eastwood's work. 1971 he became well known as a star of action movies, not only Westerns (a genre in which he first made his name) but also war movies (such as "Where Eagles Adventures") and cop thrillers (such as "Coogan's Bluff") Although "Beguiled" takes place during the war (American Civil War), and was made by Don Siegel who formerly directed Eastwood in "Coogan's Bluff" and was later the same year to direct him in "Dirty Harry", it is not an action film In most of his previous films, Eastwood played an active role, but here his role is predominantly passive - his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded refugee forced to rely on women's charity to survive. McBurney did not play any active role in the conflict, it is Quaker whose religious principles forbade him to carry weapons and serve as Union medical order. <br /> <br /> The film takes place Louisiana at the end of the war wounded and begins McBurneyem discovered by a young girl named Amy, and brought back to boarding school. The school is small, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are zealous supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand it over to the authorities, Director Martha Farnsworth decides to protect him and worry about him because he is afraid that his injuries might prove fatal if one of them were sent Confederate notoriously cruel prison camps. Although McBurney is anxious to follow the teachings of his religion in terms of pacifism, he is not as anxious to follow his teachings of fornication, and when he begins to recover, he takes full advantage of all possibilities. his opportunity to cast his charm on both the staff and the older girls, winning their number, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. It seems that 12-year-old Amy is wearing some kind of childish commotion. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the whole women's school, his presence provokes jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of Slutish Carol, conspires to a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, one woman who is supposed to resist McBurney's temptations is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, though she is trying to win her round by pointing out she is fighting to free people like her). "The Beguiled" has been described as an anti-war film, but it seems to me to be a misconception. The film is not really about the rights and crimes of civil war or war in general. The only violent acts we see are committed by non-fighters and are motivated by the desire for personal revenge, not the zeal for the cause of the Confederacy. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about psychological stress that may be caused by the special circumstances of war. At the beginning, the school, located in a beautiful old mansion of antebella, seems like an island of peace in the middle of a war. The building is in Classicist style, connected with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that develops in its walls is mess, passion and violence, the qualities associated with the Gothic writing school, which in the 19th century was often regarded as an anti-classicism. The film can be seen as falling into what was called the "South Gothic" tradition in American film and literature. The movie wasn't a big hit at the box office, maybe because Eastwood was so busy against the type. It's not his best film, but it turned out he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me", his first film as a director the following year, he was once again playing a "passive" character in danger from a vengeful woman). There are some very good performances from female cast members, particularly the Geraldine Party as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly respectable middle age spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (There are indications that she may have had an affair with a man who died as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as a shy, suppressed Edwin who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - the key moment in the movie comes when McBurney kills his pet turtle - so it's interesting that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). One character I was less interested in was Jool Harris's Carol, who looked too modern, like a swinging seventies chick who was transported to the 1860s. The film is a remarkable emotionally intense "hothouse" atmosphere that Siegel brings. It will not be a movie that is tasteful for everyone; some find it too overworked and melodramatic, and some have considered them misogyny. (Judith Crista called it "hate and sadist"). Others, however, may consider it a convincing psychological drama. 7/10
