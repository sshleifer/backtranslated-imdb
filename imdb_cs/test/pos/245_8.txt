Rita Hayworth is just where she should be - like "Cover Girl" in this 1944 Technicolor movie, with Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eva Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful showgirl, Rusty, works in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out to oysters with Genius (Silvers), a club comedian. Everyone hates oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find him, all three of them will be lucky, they believe. Rusty auditions and winning the role of a cover girl for the magazine - starting with other competitors, because the magazine's owner (Kruger) sees the resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved, who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. As soon as she becomes a cover girl, the world opens up and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants her to be successful, but at the same time realizes that he has lost it. "Cover Girl" has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern, nicknamed Martha Mears with Rita. Rita is, at best, currently playing both Rusty and Grandma in the past. For such a sexy, desirable, beautiful woman she was clearly very insecure and always under the thumb of dominating men. None of this ever appeared on the screen, nor did she want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and has brought everything she has done to life. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but she has a lot of chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very friendly and humorous as an internal comedian and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with no boring places. The only problem I have is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the person he loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays in the film, talks about getting married, her boss warns that she's not much needed for modeling business. We're not going to tell if Rusty is continuing his career or returning to work at Danny - but all the signs went to the Brooklyn Club. Why couldn't she have both? However, you cannot beat "Cover Girl" for top-notch entertainment, beautiful color, beautiful music, great energy, excellent performances and her most beautiful work, the famous Rita Hayworth.
