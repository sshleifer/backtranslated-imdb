That was a pretty good episode. Though not "Trapped in the Closet" or "Cartoon Wars", it had a lot of things to do. The character of Al Gore and the bizarre thing like "super cereal" was damn funny. But the scene that made me adore this episode, was certain that everyone would agree to be one of Cartman / Kyle's greatest moments at all. When Cartman of Kyle is superstitious, he will steal his gold (which is of course false!), And he gets in the thumb of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up and has a crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act like everything is right. Cartman at the end tainted the treasure, though predictable, was quite funny.
