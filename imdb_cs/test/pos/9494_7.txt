"Don't Change Your Husband" is another producer of soap opera producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. It is notable as the first of several films he made to play Gloria Swanson. I think you could call it a continuation of the kind of "Old Wife for the New" (1918). James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a forty-year-old couple where James went to seed and became inconclusive and lazy. He has a fondness for smelling cigars and consuming raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to get him to not make it. One night at a party at Porters, Leila meets amazing Schyler Van Sutphen (now a moniker), nephew of playboy socialite Mrs Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her home for the weekend to make James "miss her". Once there, Schyler begins to move, promising her pleasure, wealth and love, if she leaves her husband and goes with him. Sequences involving Leil's idea of ​​this promised new life are richly staged and predict the epic costumes of De Mille in a later career. Leila is bored with marriage and with her impartial husband, divorces James and marries a playboy. Eventually, James realizes that he has lost the only thing he cares about and starts to worry about his travels. She shaves her mustache, works, avoids bulbs and regains some ways. Meanwhile, not everything with pink Leila's marriage is pink. Schyler seems to like to gamble and take Nanette's golden kick (aka Tootsie, or some such name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. One fateful day, Leila meets "new" James and is accepted by changes in him. James leads her home and realizes her situation and ........ ......... <br /> <br /> This film marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's rise to a super star in a career that would compete with Mary Pickford. Hardly 20 years old, she began her career at Mack Sennett's two role comedy as a teen ager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 at the time, but he and Swanson had a good team, though it is hard to imagine someone like to love the beautiful Miss Swanson, as in this movie. Dexter and Sylvia Ashton appeared in similar "Old Wives for the New" where the wife went to seed and her husband was defective. Also in the cast are De Mille Theodore Roberts as Bishop and Raymond Hatton as a player.
