Absolute grabber film, and given his age, years before his time. For the first time I saw it a week when Dad came home with a neighbor's TV that the guy tossed on a pile of waste. Tinker with all the electrical stuff, Dad worked in two days. That was July 1955 ... and then probably just the third house on the street for HAVE! The very first thing we've ever seen on a grainy and glittering old 12-inch display was THIS FILM. "It's pretty OLD," I remember mom telling me! Nearly 50 years, and it doesn't seem to be a little older - rather than a world war in this regard! An amazing little fantasy about London's omnibus carrying thirteen passengers that crashes and kills one of their numbers. Then, in memories, we remember the lives of these people and what led them to be on this bus that day. Returning to the clash at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed, perhaps inspired by the 1960 film ADRIAN MESSENGER LIST. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this little gem, I suggest you follow it!
