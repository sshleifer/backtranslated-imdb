I really enjoyed this movie and I usually don't like animated pictures. But I thought cats were attractive and the story was charming. There is a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat," that's a lot of fun. He has some comic moments and it's an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to get this movie.
