Or maybe not. Whether anyone thinks "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all the merits of "thinking" include writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (who has long been one of the best), it is not easy to mislead the whole business - in this case, it is a "commercial" TV news - but with a smile, blink, conscious nod and laughter virtually every step of the way. To do everything that is really talent, something Mr. Brooks has in abundance. One user on this website, in his summary, asked the music question - "Did Cronkite behave like this?" Answer: No! Of course not! The reason for this is that in Walter's - uh, Mr. Cronkit - the only thing that mattered was bringing people the news. The same goes for John Chancellor Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay attention to their values ​​if they were pleased with their bosses. But everything that was really interesting was NEWS JESUS. Of course everything has changed now. Over the past 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that really matters is rating, ranking, ranking. Bottom Line. How much money will our news division deliver to the network? Don't believe it? Consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dani Rather and Peter Jennings ("Stanley Stunning"). All three are now working in their respective anchor boards for the last 15-20 years (Peter actually got his first shot on the national anchor table back in the sixties, but was totally unprepared for this job). Of these three, Dan is the biggest field trainer as a reporter. Personally, I think all three are doing amazing jobs like anchor news and deserve their position. All this has nothing to do with why all three are actually in these jobs. The three are now in their 60's (Dan pushes big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. And if you think they're still looking good, imagine how good they were when they were 40 when all three were hired (say, "put") in their current jobs. But you sincerely believe that any of these three people would be "embedded" if it looked like Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or like - heaven throws - ME !!! And not only if Dan retired tomorrow, younger (than today) Walter Cronkite couldn't get his old job back. Why? Not enough. And it doesn't matter that he is, or was once, "the most trusted man in America." And that's what's "Broadcast News". Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), another handsome boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few small things like thinking for himself, is able to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a brilliant news producer with standards for business intelligence and ethics, all of whom get into the wind when she falls on the pretty boy Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relationship with James L.), a top journalist and field reporter who has no hope of national work because he "floats" behind an anchor table. And many other flawed characters that you KNOW really exist in the news divisions of different networks. <br /> <br /> The "Net" lit up the trail. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie wildly network business "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
