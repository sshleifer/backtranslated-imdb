I have to say that this film was well made and rated as a typical sci fi film! I liked it .. its a sci-fi movie if you want a thriller to watch another channel .. That's what scifi lovers want. Greatly Made by One of the Best Producers of Sci-Fi Scot Vandiver! OK special effects were not excellent, but what a great cast! Any more money could be used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budget effects. Stop complaining and changing the channel if you don't like these types of movies .. Movies like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they're not Sci fi movies. hold them out!
