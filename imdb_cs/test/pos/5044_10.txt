I found out that this film is one of those great heartbreaking gems. Story story is tightly woven and character development is fantastic! I am a big fan of non-American films anyway and it is there: "Happenstance", "The Closet" and "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω as Fanda is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of loving life and twists and turns that the viewer needs to understand / enjoy Fanda's view of life (which almost costs him <br /> <br /> more than he is ready to give) they are beautiful. His co-founder, Stelle Zazvorkova, is as memorable as his wife. I highly recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids loved it.
