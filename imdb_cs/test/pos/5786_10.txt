I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I've seen a lot of them and love all the great information out there. Just a handful, even if it comes to offer information as important as this. I have read other people's reviews of this movie and I can't help but note that the main things people criticize are irrelevant. Such "pathetic criticism" is very one-sided, every one you see in the company will see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "It's the same people over and over again" Could be led to believe that these people are experts, so maybe they're the best people to talk to. "Shooting style is the same, head shots with a few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle Micheal Moore watches if you want info to watch real documents like this. As you can see, none of these complaints has any meaning for the information contained. My guess is that these people just miss the point and don't want to give up the SUV. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Watch it. Learn from it and continue learning about these subjects. It's very important for everyone.
