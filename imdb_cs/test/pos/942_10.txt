The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough big Aussie movies around, or that they are all the same. other Australian movies. It's unique - it will make you laugh out loud, it will cry you and feel really good about yourself. The casting of this film is excellent, and there is none in acting. Script and photos (color / light etc.) are amazing. But more importantly, it's a great movie. I don't want to talk about a conspiracy because I think it's always best to see a movie about how it is possible. Suffice it to say that this film will appeal to a wide range of viewers. Take your girlfriend, take your mom, take your friends - for a great evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
