The film, though not true to the original novels, succeeds in creating a modern gothic vampire vision. Someone tried to offend QotD that it called a 1.5h music video clip. Actually, it's a supplement. Always present goth music combined with music-video-like shots made the film so whimsical - and the "Queen of the Damned" is a mood-driven story. <br /> <br /> I don't understand dying fans who complain about story editing. The storyline has been modified to be less spectator for viewers who don't know novels. The number of characters has been reduced and I have no difficulty changing Lestat's creator or skipping the Mekar character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed very pleasant to me. In fact, I think that faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. Slow and gloomy mood that was perfect until XIX. The century of New Orlean and Louis's anxiety would not fit Lestat's uprising and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive, and combining multiple elements that pass them well, the movie just can't do it without turning chaotically. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films - the filmmakers had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects like flying or flame walking was the only thing I didn't like about this movie. But the death of Akasha was very nice. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially at the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Mary. Of course, Aalija was perfect with her quasi-old-Egyptian accent. So if you are in gothic music and vampire dillems of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be screenplays), "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few movies that show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. But please don't compare it with "Interview". It has a completely different style, just as different as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it thrilling to look at the existence of a vampire from the perspective of Louis's "bottled hunger" and then one who has no morale, but surprisingly goes to vampire Lestat. I 'd put "Queen" 8 out of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 as it is tremendously underestimated by people who hate it simply because it did not match their vision books that can be clearly seen by looking at the breakdown of votes.
