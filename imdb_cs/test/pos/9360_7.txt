"Crossfire" is a seemingly mysterious murder mystery, but what distinguishes it from other similar films of that time is the motif of a murderer who is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of ignorance that is the source of fanaticism and contains references to "villager" and Irish immigrants who also suffered from ill-treatment because of their ethnicity. The film's plot is based on Richard Brooks's novel called "Brick Foxhole" which is about hate crime where the victim was gay. Ironically, this story of the form of intolerance should face the intolerance of the censors, who said that the type of fanaticism should be changed to anti-Semitism for the screen. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier proudly proud to have served in the war against the Nazis and yet embrace his hatred of the Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered from another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. All these points seem to underline the deep-seated and insoluble nature of the whole problem of bigotry, as shown in this film. When Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that Samuels was in the company of a group of soldiers and one of them, Corporal Arthur, on the night he was killed. Mitch "Mitchell (George Cooper) is quickly identified as a major suspect. Further information is also collected from Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who is another of the soldiers that night and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), who is a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of some other soldiers, then searches for Mitchell, and when he finds him, he hears his description of what he did on the night of the murder, including a meeting with the Ginny Tremaine ballroom hostess. Br /> <br /> Keeley helps Michell to avoid arrest and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is being questioned, but her information is not sufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigation leads him to recognize the motive for crime and then construct a sophisticated trap that leads the real culprit to uncover his own guilt. "Crossfire" is a movie with news and the identity of the killer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. The message is conveyed in a way that was undoubtedly suitable for the period in which it was created, but today's standards seem somewhat difficult. J Roy Hunt's cinematography is simply amazing with low key illumination and creative use of many strategically placed table lamps that combine an evocative look that is perfectly compatible with the on-screen drama. Despite this, "Crossfire" was a great cashier success and benefited from having an immersive and very important story with a wonderful cast, two of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan) and Best Supporting Actress. (Gloria Grahame). Other nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay) are further proof of the positive recognition this film has received.
