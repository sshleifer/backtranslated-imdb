Do you like explosions? How about fighting? Well, this movie has both of you. You know, another thing you can't have without a movie: a motorcycle on your ass, a type that bounces off one's head and knocks them down. You bet the Stabilizer has one. There is also a classic reef scene. All in all, I'm pretty proud to have even seen this movie ... and even more proud that my review is the first ... YES!
