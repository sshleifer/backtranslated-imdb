This was a really moving movie in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I know first hand that I want to complete my mission, but at the same time I hid the fact that I was gay. As a character of Aaron, I was sent home for being revealed and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family wasn't as bad as she was for a leading character. This movie really took me back to those days and helped me realize a few years later how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I'm going through. I appreciated being clapped by the end of the movie when Aaron and Christian were once again in the loop at Lily Restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this movie to all who have read this review and also claim to have to buy it.
