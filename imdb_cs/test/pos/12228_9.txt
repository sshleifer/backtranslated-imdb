I came up with this movie while I surf the canal one day; and decided to give him a chance. To my surprise, I enjoyed this dark horse movie. I felt some original chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a light and warm film that I felt optimistic when I finished. Sure, this movie was predictable from the beginning, but I give it high marks for feeling when it ended. I have to admit I've never seen Challen Cates, but I feel like he can act. When you combine her good deal with her cute face and attractive figure. He has at least become a familiar star.
