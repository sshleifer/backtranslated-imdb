My husband pulled me into this movie because I wasn't interested in seeing any anime cartoon. I was absolutely pleased with the simple story and amazing animation. In a digital world where effects are computer generated, it was refreshing to see a wonderful, imaginative hand drawn animation. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a living fantasy mixed with minimal reality. I haven't seen animation like this since I was a kid, and it's great to see it last and succeed. The length of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to squirrel in movies. Overall, a great experience is worth the very expensive ticket prices we have today.
