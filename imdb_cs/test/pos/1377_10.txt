OK, so maybe it's because I'm from the north-east of Scotland and I'm just like the guys in this movie, but I've found great fun here. Inexpensive entertainment is certain, but a lot of effort has made the film look great and the actors have put it all. Actually, when I died, I was quite affected. Especially when the captain finally fell. Screenplay? It's a game of 2 halves. The open half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great that many questions are left unanswered. This will undoubtedly annoy the others, as it pisses me off. But still good fun and very clever first feature from Sturton.
