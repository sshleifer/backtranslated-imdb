Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to think" movies about Satanism ever made. The fact that it does not have MTV-jumps or gore every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also talk as someone who actually knows Satanists, (warning spoiler!), Part of the movie where the fraternity exchange their old bodies for those preschool children, it has some really scary scenes. The section where the (second warning spoiler) Strother Martin organizes the transition is almost hyper-real in that it uses very few special effects, the hallmark of this movie. McEveety rarely had a large budget, but was often effective. Also in this case it worked.
