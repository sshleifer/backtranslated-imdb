If you are one of those people who thinks Lucio Fulci is about gore, gutech and zombies, you have to watch it (and also "The Psychic"). Although the film contains some brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing subject, it's not the main thing. It is a truly impressive story and a character-driven murder mystery that could be a director's work. Here, he proves that he is a real craftsman who creates an unforgettable, intrusive but imaginative beautiful work full of scary Catholic images and interesting social commentary. He also has a great cast, including the wonderful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (from Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Yet it is Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also stared at Fulci's bizarre "Female Skin Lizard"), who stole the scene as Majara, bringing her an excellent performance by a woman who was irritated by her superstitions and her murderous murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the film is the cinematography of Sergio D'Ofizi, who, along with the melancholic Morricone-esquire score of Riz Ortolani, helps revive the "remote Italian village with dark secrets". I have to admit that the fake head hit the stones so that it pulled me away, but it's definitely a classic Italian horror classic - moving, sad and finally the idea of ​​provoking genius work. 10/10 for me. If you like it, I recommend watching Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" because they are somewhat similar and both are underestimated by gems.
