If you haven't heard of this movie, two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa follow America to make sure they find success and wealth. Life is heavier than expected in the states, and this film captures the frustration that felt when things went wrong. Lives are captured so well that many moments seem to be written because they are so perfect. Whether it's work, school, or the time between them, two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with filmmakers and make very thoughtful comments about life in states. It's one of the few documentaries that I remember when I finished, I wanted her to continue for another two hours. It can be difficult to find this movie to cause it to not get a big distribution, but check out the local "art house" or independent theater and give it one go (side note if you read when it's already on the video then definitely worth renting ). Rating: 28/40
