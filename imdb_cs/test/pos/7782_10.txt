very rarely does it happen that i sit down to write a comment for the movie .... but this movie !!!!!! oh my holy god !!!!!!!! there has never been a Hindu film better than this ...... and there has never been a movie better than this ...... it's a king of all comedy ..... <br /> <br /> aamir khan is probably the best actor of the COMIC Indian Film Industry ... though it's funny to say that because it's a class act, not a comic ... but what he did in this film is perhaps the most enjoyable show of any Indian actor out in the comedy. Salman Khan has never been a good actor in my eyes ... but this movie was the best of him .... he was an innocent comic ... if there was a term like that. Just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the film was concerned ... rajkumar santoshi do not know why, never tried his hand on comedy again. ... drove big businesses like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and khakee, but he couldn't re-create the magic of andaz apna apna .... <I don't care why this movie bombed at the box office .... hum aapke hain kaun "was the reason for his failure ...... as I hope the rumors become true ..... there will be" andaz apna apna-2 "they say ....... we as an audience we can just say AMEN !!!!!
