After "Attack Fifty Feet Woman" with Alison Hayes opened the door for women to be as dangerous as men, there was apparently an open market for other movies to pick up and carry a torch and what's more a beautiful actress than Dorothy Provine \ t , mad, crazy, crazy world "play a role. The downsizing is that the cute and blonde Provine can be too sweet and innocent when looking into 50 Allison Hayes shoes. This role really needed someone with a lot of smoldering sexual attraction; Provine is more a girl beside a door type. Maybe she married and did this role to prove that she could be sexy, but the material left her down. Lou Costello, however, proves she can make a film without Bud Abbott feeding him the line and he even interleaves a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not turn to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. However, Gordon discovers that everything that can be is stormy, disturbing and offensive, much the same as he will later create on "The Lucy Show." Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man and his screen time is limited. Special effects are convincing at the time, but I'd like Dorothy to be a little more than a cheesecake and a dressing and at least allowed to be dangerous. As the main character of the film, she takes a second billing to Costello who is in all the movie with Dorothy several times disappearing as a sub-plot. The whole movie that has been put together cannot decide whether it is science fiction, comedy or just a parody of Allison Hayes. There's a lot of good scenes, some humorous humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the movie. Still, I like this movie for women's empowerment; There's not enough movies like this. If this movie had a chance to be reworked today, I'd recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and let me completely rewrite the original script. Courtney holds my list of actresses I think she could and should play gorgeous giants adequately; although I must admit that if one of the titanic beauty of Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would go quietly!
