Jamie Foxx's masterpiece is just one of the highlights of "Ray", which he also starred in 2004 with Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau, and many others. The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles's childhood - the drowning of his brother George, who has been haunting him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength his mother taught him - Do not bend, break, never be cripple. She eventually sends him to a special school where Charles's gift of music is discovered. Another focus is on Charles's artistic evolution as the singer of Nat King Cole, his arrangement of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that has become Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles's personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many things, his heroin addiction and possible rehabilitation. Because Charles lived 74 years, much is left out. Although Charles was an orphan while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the film. While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refuses to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician is not covered. He found a glass of jelly in one place and tried to eat it, but the glass broke. It was down and out. Bea is shown with him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, receives "Georgia on my mind" as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state, yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which is not mentioned. . But she was probably there. She was also not his only wife - he once married before meeting her; that marriage is not covered. In the movie we said about one illegitimate child - there were 12. It would be impossible to get it all and more into a movie. What is not left out is his famous music, which seems to be constantly continuing throughout the film, constantly reinforcing its genius and art. Charles's story is convincing and keeps audiences around the world. Those who laugh at him as a TV film don't give him what they deserve. Taylor Hackford's direction gives "Ray" a good pace and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and beautifully evokes different decades. As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and forgets he is a comedian playing separately. Foxx was wearing a prosthesis, playing the piano and spending a lot of time with Charles, who was preparing for the role. He attracts him, but he is not the personification - he is the body and the blood person with hallucinations standing in the water and finding the body of his brother; a man full of denial of his addiction, hating the word addict and believing he is not addicted; and he is in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife does not know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the film, child); and the man took a terrible advantage early in his career due to his blindness which refuses to be walked later. Asks to be paid in 1 USD banknotes to be counted; when he finds out that he has a sauce for the club owner and partner, and has been almost cheated of record business, he will do his own business and leave his job. You don't admire so much Foxx's performance takes him as Raya from the first moment he appears on camera. This is an excellent biography that, like Walk the Line, is interrupted by the artist's fantastic music. Whether you are a Ray Charles fan, "Ray" is something you can experience.
