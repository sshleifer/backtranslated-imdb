To be honest fellow IMDb reviewers, I get this show a lot. Reason? Well, she wasn't trying to be more than she was; I think a sitcom with regular expectations, well-known and repetitive events, witty and talented actors, and smart jokes focused on university listeners. That's what Grown Ups is about: being mature, but in a funny way. Jaleel White is as funny as ever and brings funny and fun sex-oriented jokes. Humor is very nineties without taking into account the tendency of the new millennium and that is, in my opinion, the main reason why the show was not successful. It stuck in the 1990s. Oh and Mrs. Ribisi was really fun and energetic. <br /> <br /> My favorite show must be the one that deals with Karma's butt biting! It's not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of regular nostalgia in early 2000.
