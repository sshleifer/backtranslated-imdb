What can I say about this movie that doesn't give you any biased ideas when you see it? Very little. The story has to do with the return of a teenage girl from the hospital after the break-up. What follows is a movie. It is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. Everything about the film is only slightly off-center and after the movie you feel bad at ease. It's not a perfect movie. The film has problems in its last half-hour, making the confusing story even more confused. (If you have read many other comments about IMDb and elsewhere, you'll know that a lot of time has been spent trying to unlock what's happening) I'm not sure what I actually think about this movie beyond the fact that it scared and disturbed me me in ways that were the most famous horror movies ever. If you like horror and don't mind having it all clearly summarized, I suggest you try it because it will be more than likely to make your skin crawl.
