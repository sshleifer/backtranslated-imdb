Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for the murder of an autistic boy. When the 'Why?' Question is under pressure has no answer. In prison, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take things into his own hands and helps Leland find out why he did. During this film, we learned all about Leland's troubled life, including his former friend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and his whole sad life. This film is the second film by Matthew Ryan Hoge, and it is spectacular in almost every way. This is one movie that lets you think and think about how it all works. The movie is pretty dark, but if you do, you realize how good the movie is. There's no bad guy in this movie. There is no one to blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes and the audience is not trying to prove that Leland is guilty. Instead, we sit down, relax and watch this boy develop in the whole corner of the film. All the problems described in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parents' expectations, overwhelming sadness; all exist in our world. Ryan Gosling gives one of the greatest achievements of his career in this film, as depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and doesn't care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but he has his own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie: "You want why, but maybe not one is. Maybe it's something that just happened. There is a reason, but we cannot learn about it until the end. When you watch a movie, viewers are surprised that such a young person can know so much about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. The special thought provoking scene that really hit me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl just cheated on her wife, and when Leland asks why, Pearl says he's the only person. Then Leland says something that doesn't really happen to anyone: "Why do people say they did something wrong?" Another great acting job was provided by Chris Klein. In the film, plays Allen Harris, sister sister Becky Julie (Michelle Williams). Although not one of the main characters, I found myself amazed at how deep his character is. You can relate a lot to Allen. You know how he cares for the Pollard family. It's like it's his own body and blood. At the end of the movie, you realize how far he would go to help. Overall, this film is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by several people. However, if you have the time to look at it, you will most likely see that everything I mentioned above is true. And once you have finished, you will never look at the world in the same way. 9.5 / 10
