One day I came across The Last Stop in a video store and sold it for just $ 2. I decided to try and buy it. It was pretty good, I liked it. The story is about a few people who were caught in the cabin somewhere in nowhere due to the furious blizzard. There is a policeman, nancy, his ex girlfriend, two brothers who have just left prison, an elderly man and his lover, a black man and a couple who own a cabin and their son who has returned who never speaks. Suddenly it is discovered that someone is murdered and found a bag full of money. Everyone is suspicious. The last stop is a pretty good thriller, I would give it 8/10
