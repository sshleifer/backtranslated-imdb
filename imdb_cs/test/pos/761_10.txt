I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well done. His film, which significantly outperforms other films in terms of originality and enjoyment. Rupert Grint has played great, and has a general talent for acting. Almost obsessive mother added enough to the conspiracy and was a character she almost hated. This reminded me in some way of God's secrets of the Sisterhood of Ya-Ya. Not by the actual content of the movie, but by the space and overall tone of the film itself. "Driving Lesson" is the story of an age of age, which many can be very easy to relate to due to exorbitant mother, lack of freedom, and discovery of oneself.
