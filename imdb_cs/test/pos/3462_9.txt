As a 'physically attacked' person (God as I hate that phrase) I just accidentally grab it on a cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - overall it was a fantastic movie. Yes, I was a little disappointed when I found out that not one actor was disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't made of "real" disability (you can imagine what it's like to always be the highest a person in the room and then living the rest of their life with a view to nothing but other people's donkeys and crotch - had they always waited for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only disabled stall, all the rest being gross bodily expulsion while waiting? and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! it was there, literally. but the movie was so true that it was important - even though I never lived in a home or in an assisted residence, there were many times in the film when I found myself nodding and saying "yeah, that's right ... that's what happened I was intrigued by the fact that some commentators on this council expressed the fact that the film saw them a little differently and with a little insight into the life of a silent "minority" - cans ask more than that of the film that it makes you think and view life differently, so on the basis of that alone, the movies were extremely successful. should be required to view each child in high school. for almost every person who is severely disabled, independence is one, if not the most important, focus of our daily lives, from work to socialization of repetition. For those of you who felt that the film was "cliché", try to live our life for one day - you'll see that the movie was "cliché" because ..... it's true. The challenges faced by the actors have only hindered the surface of what is happening to us every day - if we are lucky, we will experience the same emotional and personal growth as the three characters (including the girl) did. Every day presents us with the obstacles that need to be overcome - it's just that there is no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives unless it's in our ipods .... lol!
