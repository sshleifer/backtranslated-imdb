I really don't know when it was that TV stations began to prefer to have nice men like their reporters - regardless of IQ men - but it was clearly a problem at the time "Broadcast News" came out, and the film does a really good job looking at it. The film of a love triangle between the pretty boy reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), offers no strikes. Probably the best line in the movie is when Tom says something like, "I really don't understand any of what I report." And in the era of FOX News and such things, this film is even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely the movie I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in the supporting role of the anchor.
