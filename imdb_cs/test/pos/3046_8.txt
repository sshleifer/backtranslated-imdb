Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as a son of immigrants, had all the incentives to do so, especially when he was blacklisted in the 1950s). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide", about his own experience of 1969, when he taught a school of impoverished black children about the outside world, much to the confusion of a right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). He added a cultural and historical context to the film's strength: Conroy (Jon Voight) tells a frustrated other teacher how many children about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even Vietnam don't know. They try to shed light on all these factors. Somewhere I read a complaint that when Conroy played children's music, he played only white music. The truth is, you can't blame the film for that. it was based on Conroy's real experience. Either way, the movie is a real gem.
