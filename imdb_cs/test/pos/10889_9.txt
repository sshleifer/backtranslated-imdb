I first played it around 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really great and loved it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. Like James Bond and complete missions in various places like Arctic Wasteland or City. My favorite was one with a tank. In the area you're in, you'll find ammunition and weapons to help you. Handguns for rifles to lasers and even fists. Again with the two-player mode there are many places to go, and some unlock. Because you never know where your opponent is, and it's surprising that you see them behind the door where you go. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very good!
