I saw it in the theater in 1982. I expected a stupid T&A movie. That's not what I got. It's basically about three teen boys trying to have sex. We get the expected sexual jokes and scenes - but once they're pretty funny! Yeah, they're stupid, but I enjoyed them anyway. Also there was a surprising amount of male nudity. Then the film, about halfway through, suddenly turns dramatically when one of the boys (Lawrence Monoson triumphant) falls in love with the girl. . Then jokes stop and things are very dark. I will not give away what is happening, but I was very surprised by the sudden turn of events. The film brings several very important themes and treats them realistically and intelligently. And he has a real mischievous ending. I give it 10 because it's probably one of the best comedy / drama ever created. It mixes imagination and realism together and works! What more can you ask for? Also has a great soundtrack.
