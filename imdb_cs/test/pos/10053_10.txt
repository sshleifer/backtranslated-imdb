I saw this movie as a child and loved it. I loved how the spunky and the full energy of Nikki were, and how most of the time Louden's perfect life of yuppie would be destroyed and corrupted and turned into her insane ways. As a child in the 1980s, I saw New York just as it was portrayed in this film, a Madonna domain, with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men who chased people around and caused confusion. Now, as an adult, I find I love a movie for the same reasons, and even more so for a love story that fights the crazy rumor of Mrs. Nikki Finn. Although I would still like to go anywhere and find the inner atrium as in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
