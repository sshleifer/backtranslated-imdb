This era was not just the dawn of caricature sound, but a cartoon character that would have been the world's most famous mouse in history. Yes, Mickey debuts here, in this fun life story aboard the steamer. The animation is good, it's time and the plot - though a little simple - is quite cheerful. A real classic, and if you manage to get a video, you won't regret it.
