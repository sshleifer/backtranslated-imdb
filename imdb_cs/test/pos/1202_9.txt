The 1979 film The Musical HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960 Broadway musical, which became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage of the musical is not much more than just a group of parodies along with some fun musical numbers; for film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for one FLEW OVER CUCKOO'S NEST) and writers took the basic premise of play and score and created a true story to make the show more user-friendly. on the big screen. In the film, naive farmer Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is about to go to the army and decides to spend a few days in New York where he meets a group of aging hippies (Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus) who involved in a group of hazel disasters, including the pursuit of a snooty girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of vignettes ranging from ridiculous to noble, but all this is beautifully photographed with the clever use of NYC sites and imaginative staged music numbers (exceptionally choreographed by Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams lights up the screen as Berger, an unconventional and free hippie who does everything he can to make Claude relax and adapt to the scene for Savage as Claude, who brings beautiful sweets to Claude. Annie Golden is a charmer like Jeannie, a pregnant hippie who is pregnant by Wright or Dacus, does not know which one is her father and does not seem to care for it. There is one excellent music number after another here ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park that includes a horse dance ... Treat Williams disrupts the fancy dinner at "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys" Late Features Nell Carter and Ellen Foley praise the ethnic virtues of men and "Easy to Be Hard" is a powerful rendition of one of the best songs in the show's original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays Wright's ex-girlfriend and mother of his child. He sang singing, and danced a psychedelic sour trip from a movie that has to be seen and once seen will initiate more views because this dazzler has a lot to offer to catch him all in one show.
