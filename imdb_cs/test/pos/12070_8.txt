This is not a great movie like tho cast (especially kids) admirably help bear after this very sad but devised plot is filled with clichés on clichés. Bad family in mid-America, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of whom has epilepsy) and a terrible decision. Its very easy to follow and some of the children's performances are moving without being sick or diesel. And little Frank and Warrnen steal my show with the last scene that leaves me no matter how many times I see it. I recommend a great rainy afternoon movie to everyone. Only those who have the heaviest heart could not move it. Not on par with Sophies Choice but good TV movie equivalent!
