One dark night has a typical teen horror movie set-up with a pretty unique twist. The ultra-light musical score and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere make a great contribution to this little film that it brings. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and leads us through a maze of mausoleum giving a sense of premonition and loneliness. Other teens are just as effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the ultimate heroine of the film. Special effects are excellent even when they are dated. This movie is very overlooked, but it can be good to never destroy it with an endless sequel. This film has great dark magic; Once you've come across, you really get it and you're in some fun. A dual-disc DVD is available, although the original negative image was not found to restore the movie. Maybe one day. I think in some ways the carbon spots in the works help the film by giving it an old school decency and making it more unexpected at the end when there are a lot of effects. The second drive has a rough cut / alternative version with a temp score version of the movie that gives more explanation to the demise of the two girls, a very Poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado" comes to mind in a new way!) Also, the big end of tension in the dark crypt. Not sure it was a hit for the main audience, but it certainly worked for me and very scary. there is also an interesting documentary that provides information about what is going on with the actors, crew, director and writer at the time; honest material, then current logos, discussions about shots and scenes, exams. Very unique that this thing exists for a small movie back then.
