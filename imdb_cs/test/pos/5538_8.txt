I just wanted to write a quick reply to all who give this movie a bad review because they think it's not funny or it's boring. Here's a trick --- the movie isn't just a comedy. It has a little depth. Like many Demme films, it deals with people living in some strange corners of our society trying to figure out how to create a fulfilling life for themselves. Unfortunately, the movie and home video industry do not deal well with the subtlety and drop it in "COMEDY" bin. It's funny, but a lot of humor is gone. But the heart of the film is not about humor, but about people in it. It may not be one of the biggest movies in the world, but it's solid and fun. And casting is one of those that shows why casting art itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and it can be a movie that has shown that she has some acting chops to add her beauty. Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoof and gets into the chewing scenery as much as he can in the role it requires. Throw Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack in smaller roles and talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast that makes a big difference as usual. Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, there is the main hot cat in this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. Sit down, expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.
