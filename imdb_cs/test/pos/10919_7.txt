In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The idea that Kevin Kline was gay was very fun. If I were him, I wouldn't like to say that I'm at my own wedding with family, friends and his wife. It would very rarely happen. I also loved to dance when a voice on the radio talked to him. I would say In & Out was a silly comedy with lots of laughter and giggles. This is a recommended comedy, and Kevin Kline has had a great performance as a homosexual. Believe me, you like this movie. <br/> 7/10
