It's better from the two killing movies, and even though his barely Schindler's list is complicated, he's bloody funny. All men are goodies or baddies and women are just Hos and emotionally needed, eg Killing Girl. It's also bloody funny and Pro must be the funniest movie of a pimp of all time, you just can't get enough of those hats, purple suits, golden chains and jive patois forever. It is best to have a Harem around him who is about to "UNNASTAN CELLS". Everything about him is bigger than life, and it's a reminder of Morris's day in purple rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a private dick for all the chicks and kicks the white ass in every direction again. The car scene is very unrealistic to survive unscathed, but hey these are the movies. Definitely the finest blax flick and overcomes Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
