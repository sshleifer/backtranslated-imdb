As a robocop fan, I have always loved this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and finally I bought it on a DVD from Brazil, it was never released to us on DVD. I like film, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their own opinion, loves it or hates it. no matter what the movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it differently?" in other words, you cannot please everyone. If you love robocop, you'll love this movie. For me it is so unique that it is not his cheese, or stupid as a lot of lower budget movies. I was always interested in this film. I see a few scenes borrowed from the robocop, but tell me what movies they won't do? many movies use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them. funny movie!
