Great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic scenario that empowers the human spirit. Take your heart to all the minions who work every day! Your patience is virtuous. Your benevolence and decency will testify in a way you never foresee. This is your big story. I do not believe that you can observe to the end without moisture appearing in this stiff eye. Or can you? It wouldn't be so for me ... the story is relentless! Idealist, denied its maturity. Does anyone talk? Ah! But you have to see the show yourself! observing the teacher in his primacy, without the announcement and the peerage of the observer would surely expect. And why does it go on? Yes! You must watch O'Toole's performance for yourself! I can only wish it to be "in print" to buy it, and then pass it to my friends as proof of respect for their faithful lives.
