Most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of "After the Funeral" is really very good. Always one of my favorite stories of Poirot, I feared it might be "confused." Well, it was a bit, but ONLY a little and the end was absolutely fun. David Suchet is still very close to flawless because Poirot and (as others have said) the next star of the show is Monica Dolan, whom she certainly couldn't improve as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott, which was just like Rosamund Shane, but in fact casting was pretty perfect! <br /> <br /> One point is disabled for adapters that can't resist too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. Doing business with will and domestic acts was a bit unnecessary, although I didn't mind how tightened the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book, the family tree is really very complicated). But the last moments when the killer is revealed are really incredibly well done and I found the same end when everyone leaves Enderby, touching touching. This is one of the best poirot lines so far.
