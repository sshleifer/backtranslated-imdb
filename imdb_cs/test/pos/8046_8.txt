The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and dearest he had ever done. In it, we see that he is trying to perfect the extensive action scene that would be necessary in his feature films, and to wrap up all the elements that made his previous action shorts successful. Griffith uses the Western format? the perfect backdrop for clean, straightforward action sets? as an environment for his first epic battle. Like many westerns in 1910, is the starting point a figure from the east that faces west? a device that might have helped release the audience into the wild, and here the eastern people are a pair of children, which was important for the type of image they were developing. For Griffith, you couldn't act without a sense of vulnerability, and here he'd inject him, with children from the east, Lillian Gish as an upset mother of a "single child in town," and even some puppies at risk of ending up in an Indian menu. This all paves the way for an immensely complex and layered action sequence, combining a scenario with hero traps and a rescue ride with the battles that Griffith was depicting from his earliest civil war images in 1909. There is a phenomenal amount of storyline Here and Griffith is doing very well to keep exciting pace through and keep everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x the number of elements in an action sequence does not mean that it is many times more exciting, no matter how skilfully balanced, and Griffith created a better tense finale before and after this. But even Griffith's image, which is so strongly focused on action, would not be without his drama, characterization and atmosphere. In the Battle of Elderbrush Gulch, emotional settings are dealt with briefly but economically. First, we have a scene in which they leave their homes. The cart, headed far away from the camera, uses depth and distance to express its departure from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is the scene in which we are introduced to the young family of Gisha, Bobby Harron and their babies. The city's people survived the precious tot, then emerged off the screen and revealed that the two Indians were watching them from behind, adding a sinister little note of danger. Many viewers today of course pointed out the battle at Elderbrush Gulch's offensive portrayal of Native Americans (in contrast to the more compassionate Red Man's gaze), but maybe not all that looks like. First look at the vest of the son of the Indian chief? it is black and covered with shiny white dots. It looks like a pearly royal jacket, maybe slightly modified for a warmer climate. Now look at the "war dance" that takes place later? it has a certain "knee-up mother brown" air to it. These are not Indians, they're cockneys! It shouldn't be offensive to Native Americans. Jen cockneys.
