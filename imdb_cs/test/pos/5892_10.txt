The best years of our lives is a movie that has slipped under my radar for years - I've heard about it, but I've never been able to look at it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to track how uncontrolled and commercial it was. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this film was how fast it was after the war. The film honestly deals with people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to include almost all kinds of war experience in three characters. We have an Air Force officer who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Due to the terrible amount of wear between the bombers' crews, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for picking officers who quickly rose to the ranks. Such was the case with this colleague who went from a humble jerk in civilian life to the captain and bomber of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called "Battle Fatigue" at the time. <br /> <br /> We have an army of non-com that served in the Pacific, and suffered through the horrors of this campaign. His story is the opposite of his story, in that he goes from the prestigious position of a banker to a humble army in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant. It is clear from the stripes on the sleeve that he is the highest level sergeant, yet he is still at the front. Finally, we have the Seaman Navy, part of an anonymous support staff. , commonly referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers) on line. Ironically, he suffers from the worst physical injuries when working as a mechanic under the decks on a Navy ship, his ship being struck, presumably kamikaze and is sunk with a loss of 400 lives. He is pulled out of the water, but his poorly burned hands are amputated and replaced by prosthetic hooks. BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet at the airport of transport that got home and how they adapted to civil society. What interested me most about this film is that, despite the obvious problems faced by the three protagonists, it never falls into the melodrama. A navy child who plays true amputation is placed in situations where we might apologize, but the script never allows us to feel this emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points to it, but it never ceases. The Air Force captain is struggling to lose his status when he is forced to return to the drug store, where soda (now bought by a large chain) has been stretched and humiliated to support his ungrateful and disloyal woman. The script provides plenty of opportunity for all of these characters to come up with some dramatic culmination in their situations, but neatly avoids it. But for too dramatic score, the director is stepping around the obvious exploitation. In one scene that represents the whole film, the daughter of Army Sergeant (Frederic March) discusses her with her father and mother concerning the Air Force Captain. Despite their marriage, they have fallen in love and are determined to break a marriage that is clearly concerned. Now we have seen thousands of scenes that are typical of where the father is angry and the daughter ends up running into her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mommy appears, protects her daughter and offers the words of maternal wisdom and all live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene is completely different from the clichés I described above. Of course, the conversation warms up, but all parties are sensible, and there's a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of the relationships that have some of the best dialogues I've seen. Finally, BYOOL is a very strong, satisfying film, with honest performances from the cast. Technically, it is well shot, editable and cinematographic, but it never covers the grasping narrative. Despite the score, which is cliché and excessive, I give this film the highest rating it deserves
