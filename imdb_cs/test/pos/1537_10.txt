This film gave me repetitive nightmares, with Alan Rickman's voice representing an omnipotent, insidious, fascist ruler. The most scary movie I've ever seen - psychological terror stronger than any "horror" movie ever made. Alan Rickman's voice always presents me with the power and horror of a totalitarian state reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. This film describes those who do not care about the reality of much of today's world governments. This film is disturbing, but in a way that everyone should follow - it's a description of the fact that no one should ever experience, but so much.
