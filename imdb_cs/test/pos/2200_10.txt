I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. He played George Hearn and featured most of the other actors who appeared in the production of a national tour that was filmed for television in Los Angeles in the 1982 edition of Los Angeles production, even though I owned videotape for many years. Production and performance could hardly be better, but the original age of the tape showed that both sound quality and video quality are under modern standards, even on the newly pressed DVD. Yet I still give 10 out of 10 because the size of work and George Hearns and Angella Lansbury is a surprisingly amazing performance. Even today, my most memorable memory of a live musical performance must be Hearn's portrayal of "These are my friends." "You will drip rubies," brrr.
