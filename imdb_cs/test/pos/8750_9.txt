What a wonderful mini-series. The original TRAFFIK stole me from everything that was on it. The original TRAFFIK is much more impressive than the American remake and boasts an amazing cast that makes less known actors to the North American audience. Juliette Binoche is mainly a recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenage government official. But it's not the star power that carries this movie (although I enjoyed the American version, I felt that the famous Americans knew it in the picture). Unfortunately I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini-series. Of course, there were no image filters, a lush locale, and a big star / director name. Europe's smudge and filth (through the world of medicines) perfectly complements the impending danger that penetrates the entire film. Problems such as the elimination of drug addiction by getting them more, bad drug struggles, and foreign governments' resistance to the destruction of their drug cultivators, make TRAFFIK fat, immersive and fearsome. time! <br /> <br /> Really incredible parts of the film come from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem in Europe was ... even everywhere! For a real education about drug problems, besides how they affect the human body, you have to follow this and the American version. Each of them shows one very clear and undeniable fact. These countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to the death and suffering of many people. Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shade, the dark secrets of every "successful" society.
