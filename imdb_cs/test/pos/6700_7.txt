Lifeforce is certainly one of Tobe Hooper's best films. She has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it looks like a typical horror dream. But the film is about to cease, and I think it's because of the script by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Nice cinematography and a good spooky atmosphere make it a hard film.
