Many people make Steven Seagals acting. And I really see why when I remember Fire Down below. Well ... ok his other movies are acceptable (in terms of his acting!). <br /> <br /> After reading The Patriot reviews, I didn't expect anything from this movie. I barely walked down the Fire and read that the Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised. In my opinion, this is one of his best films. If he had more action sequences and a few more battle scenes, it would be best. I liked the story of directing and actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. He will have a great film career in the future. Several action scenes were very well done. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role.
