I like the earlier description of this film as a poem of life. I grabbed it completely randomly on the movie channel last night, and was conquered enough to stick with it all the way. It's really just a toally unique voice to the movie, a poetry narrative that makes sense without getting stuck in preload. There are also many cheerful moments from Wirey's middle school days that are rude without being funny. Sadly, this film is so low rated. The fact that there are so many 1 makes me think that the numbers are cooked - I don't see how the film is seen by someone who is so abysmal. Certainly, it is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a unique look at the very unique life of a man whose very attractive attitude comes from his separation, the separation he must overcome before he destroys him. Give it a chance. It came out of nowhere, and I feel she's richer for it.
