Hehehe. This was one of the best funny movies on the go! I laughed, so I got out of my chair. They play with many Norwegian and foreign celebrities themselves. Harald Zwart is a producer known for movies like Agent Cody's banks and of course One Night in McCool's. the crazy fun that comes with him. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. It is said that number two will come, but I do not know. This will be hard to beat. <br /> <br /> recommended to everyone! It's a movie to see. I assumed I'd see it in the cinema, but I was busy at the time. And he tried to rent it for a month, but he rented it all the time. I got it today on DVD. Worth it.
