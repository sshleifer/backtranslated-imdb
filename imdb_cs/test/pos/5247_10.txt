Unlike the comment posted below, The Big Trail (1930) was not filmed in three cameras "like the later Cinerama". It was Napoleon's final (1927), a completely different film! The Big Trail was simultaneously shot in 35mm and 70mm (Grandeur) and both versions are displayed from time to time on Fox Movie Channel, making it easy to compare with others. The Grandeur version (broadcast in letterbox @ format in its original 2-1 ratio) is more impressive in kinematics with widescreen panoramic panoramas but suffers from the same problem that early CinemaScopes suffered, the lack of detail forced by director Raoul Walsh because of problems. Scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version, as the camera can approach players to achieve a greater viewer engagement. Watching both versions at the same time, one gets an exact idea of ​​which Walsh shots decided to shoot close-ups, in the standard version, but couldn't, in the Grandeur version. There are also several sequences that include El Brendel: a shell game with Ian Keith, and some store with his wife and jackass that are in the Grandeur version but are missing in the standard version. <br /> <br /> For the record, The Big Trail is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur movies that has survived in its original widescreen format. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies 1929, entirely lost, and Happy Days, which survives only in the standard format.) Other studios have also experimented with a wide film at this time, but the only other one still known to exist in both formats is Bat Whispers filmed in 65mm and 35mm, released by United Artists. Other broad films were MGM's Billy Child (1930) and Big Meadow (1931), RKO's Lights of Light (1930), and WB's Lash (1930), all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on Turner's classic films. WB Kismet (1930) was also filmed as wide and standard, but seems to have completely disappeared; it is said to be lost. Why did a wide movie fail in 1930? Theaters were reeling (puns) under the October 1929 stock market crash and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment, so it was unfavorable to take on additional installation costs for new projectors and new wider screens that would fit just a few movies photographed in different systems that have not always been mutually compatible. It would not be until 1953 when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would try again, and this time to succeed, with the introduction of the widescreen CinemaScope.
