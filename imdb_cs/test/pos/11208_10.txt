Hysterically painful; perhaps the movie Chekhov would do if he made films. What is really funny is that two cousins ​​have so much in common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong). <br /> <br /> What is really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they can 'bring themselves together - or anyone else! That's horrible. If you've ever been too shy, worried, confident, or just scared to talk to someone (and who doesn't?), You will definitely see this movie. And it won't be nice. <br /> <br /> Holds a mirror for the audience and says, "If you don't like what you see ... change it".
