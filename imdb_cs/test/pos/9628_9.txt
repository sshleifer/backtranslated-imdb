"Five Fingers of Death" kicked off American Kung Fu film madness, but I remember seeing him for the first time as "King Boxer" in NYC, with no bad dubbing and a few Americans. I was also lucky to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers Of Death" in Times Square, New York. In contrast, it turned out to be the same film but another audience. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown, this film has taken a more serious tone to viewers. It was because of the actual voices of the actors (in Chinese) that made this film more believable. Theaters in Chinatown have shown violent kung fu movies for years (1972's "Boxer by Shantung" to defeat all in gore), so action choreography and story were the main attraction. Rival school grounds were not exaggerated yet so the story looked fresh. Every big kung fu movie had amazing, dastardly bad guys that you wanted to see for their coming and FFoD too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a well-known actor in Chinese theaters. Mostly the Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. The audience disappears when it leaves this film, giving me the ultimate satisfaction. In Times Square, this movie was an action comedy ... probably unintentionally. I liked it too, but for a variety of reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the very beginning, the movie laughed at you. When viewers heard those strange British accents come from those Chinese actors, the film turned into a violent and cruel cartoon. Most American viewers saw this kind of horror in a horror movie not in action movie. The action sequence threw the audience away. Unfortunately, film studios saw that they liked it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu formula. I enjoyed seeing this movie with an American audience, but it was much more enjoyed by Chinatown. Some movies can pass the time test, but the dubbed version of FFoD cannot. The original "King Boxer" is still ... CLASSIC!
