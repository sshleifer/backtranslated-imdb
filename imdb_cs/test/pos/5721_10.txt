John Leguizamo's one man shows are hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed off his intense characterization and great timing, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama completed the first as well, but this time the material was funny, Freak's classic followed by his disappointed sex- o-holic. But his stuff in Freak is showing his genius and without being peer when he is in focus. Freaky's semi-autobiographical view of the journey of a young man has power and resonance. he knew. By giving us the opportunity to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project his own life on his and there can be no greater gift the artist can provide. The willingness to drop the "wall", reveal and share is too frightening for most actors - they use characters who hide behind their backs - but JL goes smoothly and smashes all prejudices. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comics / actors because they spoke from their hearts about what they noticed in society, and the truth provided shocking humor. Combine it with a great act of mimicry and being in the moment (not to mention the sense of humanity) and you'll see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least she does in Freak. From birth to the first big break, and between every moment of life changing, the viewer sees our hosts and other characters in their most private moments, experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with. Looking drained and slim muscular-tight JL rings with sweat at the end of the evening, which offered its crazy life to the audience; Spike Lee's liquid camera work captures the actor's nuances up to the last lips curl and slow winks. The scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to see the Chorus line with his gay, deaf uncle; His first girlfriend is cruel humiliation when she undresses naked, eager to have sex. A nightmare first sexual encounter with a great German woman in the back of Kentucky Fried Chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunken drunk drunk" in a bar on St. Peter's Day. The culmination of a serious showdown with his mother and father here is that he shows his true genius: he plays the scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic / humorous intensity, forgetting that you only look at one person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks or makeup. Just an actor who gives everything. It's just amazing. The other actors / comedians who are currently performing are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they are so deep in themselves as John Leguizamo; it's not a criticism, not a long shot. I love their work, but Freak is different. It moves in the no-b ******* method. He is the best man you see there and no one can touch him for a long time.
