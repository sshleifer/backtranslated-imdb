Naked City: JWAB does a fairly good job of balancing its two-A stories, eventhough I am not entirely fond of more movie plots. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance make a great screen image. However, I'm not sure what kind of news the movie will send when two girls with flat feet in the country can get out of the murder, big theft and win free flight home (no less in the first class - at least in terms of their clothing anyway). Gee, I think the blue wall of silence is still thinking! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
