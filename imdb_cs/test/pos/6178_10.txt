Centers of Czech Pilots of World War II ?? older Frantisek, boy impulsive Karel and in the background a quiet piano Honza. As the film opens, it's 1950, the war is over, and Francis and Honza are trapped in a former monastery. In their native land controlled by the Soviet, they are "the enemy of the people." Honza is badly damaged by his Communist compatriots and dies. In 1939, many pilots managed to escape the German occupied Europe and get to England to join the RAF. Regardless of their high motivation and experience, they face the reluctance of the RAF and the British stiff lip. Eventually they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However, Francis and Charles found that their friendship was strictly tested when they both fit the same woman. As for the romantic look, it's very similar to Pearl Harbor's Hollywood production. However, given the context of the film and the possible fate of Francis, it is also possible to read the English treatment of both men as a symbol of British treatment of Czech and Polish RAF pilots: forget them comfortably after the war. In addition, the film is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are fully realized. The Dark Blue World also evaluates its stunning aerial fights that were smoothly created using a mix of models, real live action aerial shooting and the 1969 Battle of Britain epic. done, moving, thought provocative and exciting drama that puts players like Pearl Harbor in shame. Highly recommended.
