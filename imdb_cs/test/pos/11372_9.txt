I believe it was over 40 years since I saw this series, but the memory of it didn't fade. That would be natural for releasing a DVD, it seems to me. Many of the artists continued to greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, naming the pair); although it was a small part, I still remember Judy Dench, then in her 20's, like Katherine France (Henry V). She was very nice, like now. <br /> <br /> There is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color - right? Which of us would know - practically no color television at that time. Too bad, no video recorders; if so, some might notice it. As a way of teaching English history, this series has made it come alive with the ways few teachers of classrooms master. <br /> <br /> What would be a good problem?
