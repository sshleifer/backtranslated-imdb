I did this for a TV movie. I was surfing the canals and came across the beginning of the movie. Boy I'm glad I quit. This movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi-credible plot. It's drama, comedy, action and the best of all the human character of this movie is what makes it great. I hope it comes out on Video because I buy a copy. Rating ... 9 out of 10 stars
