This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced in Detroit's ABC affiliate and syndicated to 90 markets across the country. This last week, Detroit Public Television had a 1-1 / 2 hour clip show as part of their promise unit. Wow, the memories that reappeared! While I remembered the show, there were segments that I forgot, but I immediately remembered when they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and cakes in the face). <br /> <br /> For more information on public television, search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
