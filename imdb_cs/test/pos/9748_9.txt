After 66 years of "Flash Gordon" he still has an attractive sci-fi / adventure / epic feeling that many of today's sci-fi adventures are striving to fail. The only way to fully enjoy this series is to just sit back and do nothing (hokey effects, dialogue, why Flash doesn't go for Princess Aura, etc.). And as for the older people who saw "Flash Gordon" back on the serial display or on TV "back in the day", if you want this gentle series to remain attractive for future generations, get your kids / grandchildren to look at them looking, he's young. It worked for me (a man over the age of 18). 9 of 10
