Well, now I thought it would be another cheesy romantic comedy that was reflected in the comedy, but it wasn't. I mean, how could it have been with the wonderful Amanda Bynes staring at her! She was amazing, really fun and still overwhelming! The boys were also very fit, one of the main reasons for the girls! The plot is strongly based on Shakespeare's play 'Twelfth Night', as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to malvolio as a character. The script was really well written and drawn together and was very funny. Football skills in it were also amazing, even I thought of playing football alone! To sum up, it's a light film about a young romance that's very confusing! Go and see it!
