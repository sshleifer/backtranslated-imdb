I caught it in Chicago IndieFest and I must say that they are ONE is much more fun than other reviews and even websites would lead you to think. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers is funny, but sick, twisted, I can't believe she just said it, but it's so damn funny. Jessica Bohl, who deservedly earned the best actress, is amazing to watch. There is never a time when you think I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. He's too damn real for words. In fact, there are two scenes I still giggle about, and I won't give them away, but she's in the bathroom and talks about how much she'll get paid for performing a particular service and how it's done "Awesome". (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking about the same thing!) <br /> <br /> In another, he talks about the definition of "sex" for adolescents and adults, and if it's not the truest dialogue I've heard in the film for a long time time, I don't know what it is.
