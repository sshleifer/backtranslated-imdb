This film is suitable for entertainment purposes but is not historically reliable. If you're looking for a movie and thinking about yourself `Oh I want to know more about Custer's life and his last stand ', don't rent' They died with their shoes'. But if you want to watch an older Western movie, with a little romance and just a good story, it's a fun movie you can watch. The story begins with Custer (Errol Flynn) the first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality that allows him to get away with most of everything. The film follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The film ends with his last stand on the Little Big Horn. Among the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). Errol Flynn displays arrogant but live George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays cute, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their chemistry on the screen convinced you in their romance. Acting in general was impressive, especially comedy roles (though stereotypical) played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh. Heroic war music has brought excitement to battle scenes. Beautiful costumes determined the tone of the era. The screenplay, occasionally, was sinister, though the film was still a nice to watch. The director's portrait of Custer was a hero and history shows that it is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this film and learn to hate it. I give him a thumbs up for this 1942 Western movie.
