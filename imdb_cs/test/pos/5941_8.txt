Sure, there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. The breathtaking woman first panics and then, just a few minutes later, starts kissing the young boy while the old one is right next to her. But as the film goes on, we learn that it is a small, unstable girl (or bitch) and this partly explains her behavior. The camera of this movie is very good. We see a lift from almost every angle and perspective, and some of these images and scenes actually increase tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, wannabe hot-shot aging and is overwhelmed by young men such as Jaennicke. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, brings a great performance that, while not saying much, is by far the best actor of the game. One critic complained that the film is unrealistic and that nothing really happens in a real emergency. But again, how realistic movies like missions are impossible or a phone booth. Since we're talking about film here, and you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't likely to be in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than many of the things I see on German TV these days, and I think 80's has added something to this movie.
