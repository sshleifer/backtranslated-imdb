I saw the Dark Harbor at the '98 Seattle Film Festival. Filmed against the autumn background in Maine, this film boasts an excellent cast and a chart that keeps you guessing. Sometimes scary, sometimes funny, I have to say that I stayed with me a few days after I saw it. Rickman and Walker are amazing because ice husbands and Reedus are someone you'll hear more from, I'm sure. The opening shot of the zigzag, deserted road in the downpour at dusk (and the score that accompanied it) set the tone so well - just amazing. Nice, nice work from a new director / screenwriter and his talented crew.
