Tell that manipulative drivel if you want, but I fell for it. Sure, there might be more character development. Yeah, it could have been a better cinematography and a less permanent "movie of the week", but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Good adorable and touching, and let's face it, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. Not too much. We got a little insight into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialogue, in my opinion, not to be forgotten soon), so in my opinion it was a beautiful tribute to one human being who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being and meanwhile, he touched the lives of hundreds more. The lesson we need to remind me. Why is it right that this is the hardest thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You won't be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
