Boogie Nights is one of the best movies that comes out of the 90s and I would go so far that it should be in the top 250 best IMDb. Personally, I feel so much, judging by the way this movie has been won by viewers and critics, that it is the ultimate creation of the film. <br /> <br /> The direction and action in this film outperforms good and reaches brilliance. There is not one scene in this movie that is not amazing. Individual characters will appeal to you and touch you. Since it is a film about the pornographic industry, one would not imagine that sex scenes could be processed with such sensitivity, but they are. Direction is one of the best I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The film is not about one particular individual's individual story, it's about many. About people who have many layers to them and who maybe in the industry most would find strangers but who still dream of the same dreams and have both bad and good for them. Boogie Nights draws you into your story from the outset, and although the movie is long (I believe it is almost 3 hours), you will not honestly notice. And when it ends, you don't want it to be ... <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to impress, which means there aren't many movies that I would give 10 out of 10 ratings but this is one. The study of more characters is the use of music in film. I have never in all my years to see movies to see the music tell the story as well as in this movie. There was such a flaw on it, you know it's not something you'll see every day. Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is unbelievable (I'm amazed that there are still people who say he's not doing well. A person who really surprised me , was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in her role, especially one unforgettable scene with Burt Reynolds in Lima, to the end. for everyone, but I still think it was the top 10 of 10.
