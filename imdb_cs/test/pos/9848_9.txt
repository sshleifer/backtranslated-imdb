I mentioned that there could be a spoiler, just to be careful about what I'm talking about, even though I don't think I was giving away something important. Any "weirdness" is really important to the success of this movie or to the viewer's ability to enjoy it. Although it is not without any minor shortcomings, it is a beautiful and very moving movie about friendship, time, insecurity and the possibilities people make about their lives. At the same time, it is also a very witty movie, in which small, mostly underestimated pieces of comedy are hidden. For most of the film, he progresses at a relatively calm pace, but does not seem slow, because the film draws him into life and into the life of the characters and is usually mostly cheerful. Some commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such an amazing depiction of the life of such sympathetic characters that could be seen almost infinitely. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the very end, and the progress is processed beautifully. Finally, some characters decide to rob the bank, and although it may be hard to believe, it's next to the point. It's an amazing addition to emphasizing the love these friends have for themselves, while at the same time accentuating humor and giving the film a little more irony. And while it's hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are pretty original and they make it beautiful, so it's really pretty funny, for example when Ismet (if I remember) exaggerates his "disguise" reality is old. As I said, most other comedies are rather low, but still very funny, so I was always giggling. Actors are probably the real key to this movie. He builds a deep personality and sympathy for the characters and renders them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or minor details of personality figures that are downloaded smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the film is about the characters of these characters and how they care about them and how they work with them. They are doing well, and if smaller actors have roles that the film could fail. Balls Balls are not without sadness, but simply provide a full range of emotions and provide a stronger Experience. In fact, the film is so moving and filled with the love of such rich characters that, despite its sadness, it is ultimately a very warm, satisfying and even happy movie. I can watch it over and over again.
