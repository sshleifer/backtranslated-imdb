This film is to be seen on music, which is actually a beautiful cantata composed of Sergei Prokofiev. Of course, the original soundtrack is not entirely hi-fi, but many excellent versions are available in classical music selections. Cantata can be appreciated for itself, but when he saw the movie helps. The story itself is a fairly standard Soviet anti-German war propaganda. The amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time to appeal to Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eisenstein was assigned to a German film for a short while, like repentance. Prince Alexander Nevsky (worshiped as a saint by Russian Orthodox), having his nickname by defeating Swedish raids on the Neva River, collects Russian resistance against the invasion by the Teutonic Knights, and closes his victory with a strict warning to other potential attackers. Interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians who are considered to be slaves by Mongol soldiers, and does nothing to stop it because his knights are his priority. Historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to Mongol khans, like his father before him, while working on consolidating his empire of future independence.
