Å koda Monkees. People have always blamed them for being manufactured (which they were) or not being the American Knock-Off Beatles (again, what they were), but the children were important when they were real, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common in school yards, but critics, but they never quite bought it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, Monkess didn't get much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, a single film movie met a similar fate despite the fact that it is the best film in the world. Beatle fans can argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many of the kids think "8 Mile" was excellent, but none of these movies were as bold and resourceful as "Head" and that is probably the reason why it failed. If Head said A-to-B straight story, maybe it would appeal to young fans of the bands, but by sending the film and taking advantage of film opportunities to ridicule their own image, they really tricked the film their fans. You can imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad he is being the best-selling man in the genre in which only 5% (and I'm generous) of white acts. If you can imagine it before you know how brave it was for Monkess to sing "Hey, Hey, we're Monkees. You know we like it. Made a picture without philosophy". When you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on dancing and more on music, it is clear that there is much more than you expected. The story, what it is, concerns boys trying to escape from their manager, who is in one place forcing them to play dandruff in advertising, but every time they run, they end up inside the box. I don't think you should be Fellini to find out the symbolism of that bit. Some neat little comedy stunts follow Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin in order to dive in a great match and Peter refuses to discard the ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so his bad waste meal, but the real selling point of this movie is music and her best of bands she ever recorded. Even if the story discourages you, you can sit back and enjoy great music. Any movie that begins and ends with an attempt to suicide Mickey's jump from the bridge (the band follows him at the end) will never be a mainstream classic, but if you are a fan of a band or an experimental film before this one enjoy the film.
