This is a truly amazing love story. I liked the song, but if not, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best place and Petula Clark is also doing well. I first saw it when I was about 13 and then I loved it. After 40, I still enjoyed it, probably even more. Still crying and laughing and feeling good. It's a movie that only looks at a guy from a new age or at himself because he's a cat. But what's wrong with it. You need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
