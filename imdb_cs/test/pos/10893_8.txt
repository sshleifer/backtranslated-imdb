This is one of my favorite James bond in games because: Missions are fun to play having a lot of actions in them can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good. As James bond bond in this James bond game is quite you can see pierce brosnan in it which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like actors who played in the movie. There is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game I loved it. \ TAlso the game follows a movie of almost maybe a few added things, but it almost follows the movie. Also this James Bond game has pretty good graphics for Nintendo 64 and bad was no game over actors in this game, but who cared if the game is fun to play. <br /> <br /> Total score ** ****** outside **********
