Who plays J. Douglas Williamson on the scene of the poker scene has a great job. Apparently he didn't get any credits. Damage. All Dead End babies are doing their job beautifully in this 1939 record. It's strange to watch them in the Western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I think it should be Bowery). Even some swimming skills. I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite right now is in the battle scene near the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his experience with the dance film when John Garfield moves his feet and as we watch them move the camera moves up to his face. I will not give out why or when, but the look at his face at this point probably brought the 1939 audience to the feet of the theaters. Some will think that John Garfield looks like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face. In fact, Frank hasn't made movies yet, so Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the film looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch a movie, watch your grandmother's hands. May Robson is well involved. He seems to have a little hand. In the scene where she and the crowd go to the boxers (John Garfield) locker room, watch where she is lying lying John Garfield while he is wearing only the trunks. <br /> <br /> The big end. Lots of wonderful characters. The best line could be at the gas station, "... eight gallons, that's twenty-eight dollars ..." Tom Willett
