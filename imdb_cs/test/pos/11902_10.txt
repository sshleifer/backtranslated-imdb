I was fortunate enough to see a test "El Padrino" in Santa Monica a few months ago. I was blown away. You don't see such movies anymore. In the spirit of Scosses, Chapa tells the tragic story of Kilo when he maneuvers on the hard streets of LA to rise above the position to become the drug master of the Escobar proportions. Characters are complex and conflicting. Emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. Stunts are extensive. And Tilly's HOT. She didn't look so good since her days were tied. I would recommend it to everyone. It is a fantastic tribute to epic action films from the late 1980s and early 1990s. And all the naysayers out there? watch it again; apparently you closed your eyes for the first time. Congratulations to everyone in the movie. I count the days until the continuation is released. Whoever has a date on it?
