I have to say that some of the other reviews of this film I have read show that it is not very little, nor the original TV series from which it comes. Dad's army was a sitcom, so she had humor, so she had to smile on the face of a desperate situation. However the series bore very many serious messages such as the episode 'branded' about bigotry and ignorance that was chained to conscientious opponents. The film was faithful to the series and was simply as a widespread episode. I'm afraid that a reviewer who claimed that Columbia had improved humor was pretty bad and let's face it - the BBC sitcom of this period beat everything that came out of America. Also, comments on propaganda were out of the way. Homeguard people were considered inappropriate for a frontline service that still wished to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they registered when Hitler announced that anyone who had done so would be executed if and when Britain was attacked. Thank you for allowing me to set the record as it is always good to actually talk and comment on what was seen, rather when I do it.
