Beautiful, magical, provocative and cordial story. Great direction, perfect cast, amazing script, excellent score, beautifully lit ...... Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> If you like movies that not only convince you, but also warm up your heart (some of the spring in mind are 'Contact', 'Field of Dreams' and 'Groundhog Day'), then you'll love K-PAX. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend.
