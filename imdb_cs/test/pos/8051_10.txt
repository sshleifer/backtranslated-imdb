The film is the starter of what really happened at Phenix City. I am the grandson of the people who really lived the story. The truth never came out of my knowledge. I tried to find the whole story, but the people who lived are still afraid to say it. Phenix City is still led by warped people. Albert Patterson was not entirely a saint who wants you to believe. The story was shot at Phenix City. It still has some of the famous places in it that you see in the movie. Colonal Funeral Home still looks the same. But if you want the true history of Sin City, you need to visit us and find people who will gladly tell you about Ma beachies and her favors. She got no name for me.
