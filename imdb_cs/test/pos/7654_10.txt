This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Roma communities woven with music. It is a lot of musician's film because the lack of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is is not important for the story structure. Some might expect National Geographic to tell a story of "habits, dress and music" or a plot line that circulates several central characters - they don't look for it. It's because he paints a portrait rather than telling an individual's story. The storyline is a story through space (India to Andalusia) and / or / time (we can't say) people. No need to tell. You get a sense of joyful people, strongly linked to small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great feeling of sadness in some parts, while rejecting them as a whole. So it is a paean to Roma culture, very beautifully shot, with a wide range of Roma music and a sting in the tail, which the people faced and still faces.
