When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was about, and I've never heard of it before. But I have to say I was surprised. The first few minutes are almost the funniest of the movie. Trader from India is too funny! By the way, the story isn't much to talk about, but I think it's okay. Playing on the other side is pretty good, and the only single actor I met was Mickey Rourke, who wasn't in the movie until the end. And the end is where I think it's not bad, but I don't feel like it really ends. I feel like there should be something more. The final battle in some way. I don't know. All in all, it was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone in Tarantino movies with lots of violence and dark, sinister humor! I rate it 7/10.
