Nowadays it is hard to imagine how popular and how much impact a Norwegian immigrant and chemist would have on the American public and how much national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was seen. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic school on the map. I heard Rockne's famous talks and it's mysterious how Pat O "Brien finished his voice and declension." In what turned out to be his career, Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and the fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne is well helped by Gale's page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw someone out of her house. Rockne's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One beautiful day in the second half of the lost football game against the strongly favored army, Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais played Owen Davis used the attack forward as an offensive weapon. Before that, football was just a game where you just got bigger guys on your side and ran through the defense. Rockne did not invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became the strategy of the game as well as after him. Rockne knew how to work with the media. Those well-advertised interviews were not just inspiring his players. They were well publicized and it was a lot of him that college football became the main sport in this Golden Age of Sports in the twenties. Playing small but key role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp, the first player to Rockne trained to reach greatness, Reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was useful in his subsequent political career. That the mortal scene that Rockne swore was accurate became a republican battle scream because many GOP NCOs went out to win one for Gipper. recovering President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always attributed to O'Brien and Dick Powell all the Warner Brothers stars of the season as the kindest and most encouraging young player in the tournament that tried to make a good one. Notre Dame owes its prestige to Rockne. It is quite possible that Notre Dame would be a dark little Catholic college with no reputation for bringing it to her. Although George Gipp and later famous four-rider backfalls definitely had their place in the sun, Rockne was a legend. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputation to appear in Knute Rockne, All American. It was a way to honor a guy who was number one in his profession. I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne, All American. Although you could become one after watching a movie.
