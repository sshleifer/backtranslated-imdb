This is one of those movies that look so "dated" that it is part of the fun. You see and hear things you would never see or hear on a silver screen. Some of them are good; some that too korny for words, some that bad (depending on your opinions on certain cultural issues.) <br /> <br /> For example in this short film (68 minutes) 1931 you have: <br /> <Grandpa Family, who appears in this story, advocates the value of patriotism and why he should speak against criminals for the good of the United States (a picture that is in today's movies!) and the population turned out to be 100 percent supported (again, a picture that is in modern movies.) <br /> <br /> On the way, you have some shocking violence, such as a young boy who has been picked up several times the wardrobe, and his father was raised and repeatedly thrown his head into the wall. This is at least a tough thing. Still, the film is dotted with comedy, mostly patriotic grandfather, an unforgettable sale of Charles "Chic". There's a lot of laughter for everyone who views this unique crime movie. And for the soft touches, there are two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a well-known child actor in his day. Here is only a little age of about 5 years, which is of course far from being a polished actor, but you can see a star on the horizon. In fact, he did only the following year with fixed performance in "Blond Venus," starring Marlene Dietrich. Anyway, this is a funny movie because of the effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality .... and has a nice feeling of good ending and a thought provoking message. It was also for the Oscar Award, for "Best Writing, Original Story." I'm sorry it's only available for viewing on cable TV because it has never been released on VHS or DVD ..... and that's a shame .
