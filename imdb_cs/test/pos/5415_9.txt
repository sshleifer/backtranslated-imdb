He saw this film when it was an entry at the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy movie! The depiction of a totally dysfunctional family that has reached another level of extreme could leave me depressed to the limit if it were not for very funny gags and a dialogue on the road that lightened the overall tone of film. The relatively "uplifting" end gave hope to those who were hit by the initial tragedy. Still, I didn't come out of the theater and wanted to go to a fun party. The movie stayed with me for a few days. Brought back memories of "ordinary people" but with humor combined with tragedy. I thought acting was excellent, especially Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. As each character dealt with the tragedy, she was occasionally sad, suicidal, but also cheerful at times. Clever dialogue and situation.
