This film has 4 parts and each is about 170 minutes long. It is based on the true life story of Joe Bonanna and says everything he saw. So in some events we may notice that we have heard otherwise. The movie to tie you to a chair to the end, I think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row and not noticed I watched 2 in a row and 2 another day in a row. Acting in the movie is fine in some scenes, but in general it could be a lot worse, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor, this show is the real thing and the story is the key to this movie. So whoever is looking for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic movie can skip this. The good thing about the film is that it follows the main story, so you won't have long and boring love scenes or other interruptions with something that's not important to Bonanno's crime.
