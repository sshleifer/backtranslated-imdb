After seeing a preview of this movie in my local department store, where there is a stall for buying foreign films, I thought it looked very fun. Before watching the movie, I continued on IMDb to see what ratings and comments he received. I was worried when I noticed low numbers and negative ratings. Despite the hype I watched the movie and to my surprise I found it incredible. The story was great (pay attention) and the characters and their relationships in the movie are overwhelming. I have not seen such a long combination of leading characters. I felt both characters and felt a strong bond. As I read previous posts about this movie is not "epic" enough or lack of martial arts I could not disagree more. This movie is what it is, it's not a Brave Heart and it's not Enter a Dragon, but it's still an amazing movie that does a great job combining story and action. While Sword In The Moon is not perfect (what movie is it?) it is still amazing and moving. Just wait until the end of the scene, along with music and cinema, breathtaking. I hope that more people will see this film and give it a fair vote.
