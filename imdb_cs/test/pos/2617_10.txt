Piper, Prue and Phoebe Bring Dr Griffiths to the estate to try to save him from his personal murderer, Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Shadow Book for Shax published by Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chasing him on the street. Prue and Piper failed, they were filmed by a reporter and cameraman who used his powers and aired live on national television. With Phoebe in the underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo have to find a way to reverse the damage. Leo goes down to Phoebe, and tells her that Charmed Ones has been exposed as a witch. On the surface, Piper is shot by a manic witch, and Prue must take her to the hospital. The problem is that the crowds are blocking the driveway. So Prue must use the spell on the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Piper is pronounced dead, and the SWAT team moves in. Leo learns about Piper's death and goes down to say Phoebe. Cole is asked to ask the Source to reset the time, and The Source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal breaks them. On the surface of Prue and Piper they fight Shax. Prue shouts at Phoebe, who doesn't know that she's in the underworld. Shax throws Piper and Prue through the wall and Dr. Griffiths out the window. Prue is not pronounced dead until Season 4 Premiere episode, "Charmed Again, Part One". "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a breathtaking episode, and I'm sitting on the edge of my seat. Sadly, Prue is dead, but happy to be there for the next five Charmed seasons. My voice; 10 of 10. EXCELLENT
