I fell in love with this girl. Let me tell you: I'm from Romania and here's just the sixth series running every other day on TV in the US, checking the internet and downloading it from there, so I'm in line with the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am in this show. I found out about them all I saw on the internet, what is Rory's car, what are their middle names and so on: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can't understand why, but my friend doesn't like them, and I try to see him as wonderful, but without success, but he understands and lets me be with his "obsession" with Gilmore Girls. I adore them. I really hope that if anyone sees it, they will try: You won't regret it
