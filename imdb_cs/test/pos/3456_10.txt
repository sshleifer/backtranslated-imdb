This is an incredible piece of drama and a powerful one that will hit you. I found out that the film is great and that I have dealt with two major disabilities, it was in a great performance of two Michael and Rora. Whether the story is based on a true story, I feel that the story has tried to give the listener a message that the public as a whole should respect and feel for the needs of people with disabilities and that they should be given the same chances as any other. human. Overall, this film gets into my soul, and I also felt hit by the actors and the director who sent creativity there. The whole idea is that some actors take her to play their character and show only part of the character that is believable to the audience, but I think these two two two two years have certainly been used as talented talents to portray the drama masterpiece. You must not miss it!
