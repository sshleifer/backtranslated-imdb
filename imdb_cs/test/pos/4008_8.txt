I look at the show every day and it's very fun. It provides tech news updates, video games almost all geek. They are also official broadcasts of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, a player or something, you will enjoy this show. Since the guy under review (2006), they have definitely won. It's the only place I have technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully together and the show always has segments that refer to things in the game, movie, comics ... Universe. If you know these universes, you will understand jokes. Long story short, aots is a cheerful show that gives me all and all the news about something and everything you care about. I'm watching it right now when I write this, it's 'in' San Diego, which covers the air races of red bulls. Sweet.
