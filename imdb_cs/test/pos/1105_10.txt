I saw this film at the third Adelaide International Film Festival in the Palace Theater and was completely switched to it in the first five minutes. Thank goodness for a movie that ignores all the trash we often see in Australian movies that seem to rotate around a) race b) sex and c) class, in favor of er… dare to say… a good movie theater. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric guy named Alex Frayne, introduced his film, made with a bunch of his friends near the city where he spent most of his childhood. He probably spent most of last year traveling the world with film, mostly in Europe. The world that makes the film is not only brilliant, but also divine, not least because of the weird and disturbing style of editing, the Gothic characters and the surrealistic sense of time and place that draws the audience into its frightening empire. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer has returned for Q + A consequences. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - "South Australia" replied. Listen, listen! Another asked him what "Alexa's Day" means. He replied that he was driving old Ute to have breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant he had consumed in the last 8 years! and that he plays the piano that helps him think. He does not drink booze and plays cricket once a week. Subsequently, the Q and A sessions ended suddenly due to another film screening - so my thoughts are that the next festival needs to be expanded to a film session.
