Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). Norton has financial difficulties, unknown to the owner, has an employee who sells secrets to a competitor's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian because he's a loyal and loyal employee and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli), has something for Brian and Norton that puts Brian's motives to take care of her. But Brian comes with a big security device. His name is CHOMPS, which means the dog's home security system. A device that looks like a dog is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to catch a thief. The opponent of the opponent sends two bosses (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS Save Norton Security? This is a fun family movie from an old school of good, clean fun. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by adorable and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role, as Brian has a "true" dog named Rascal, as well. Just watching this little dog in action is pure pleasure, because he is able to shrink walls, "drag" trucks and control machine buttons to catch bad guys. Human casting is also quite nice, with anyone giving positive performances that are infectious. Also costumes, scenery and production values ​​are good. While you may have trouble placing a movie, it would be well worth getting a look at the nearest ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, healthy move away from the world's misery.
