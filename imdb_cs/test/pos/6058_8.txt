D.I. (4 out 5 stars) Wow, I certainly didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I never heard of it until I saw it sitting in a discount video. I thought Jack Webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for laughter, but he thought the drama would fade in comparison to that recent D.I.s movie, as shown in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and Gentleman." Boy, I was wrong. That's probably the best job Webb has ever done ... far and far better than his "note" show. The delivery of his hard guy dialogue is simply brilliant ... done in a patented monotonous design, but you * know that that person means. The story may seem a little hockey compared to the harsh military movies that followed, but I still noticed that the film is fascinating and persuasive. Even a completely unnecessary musical break in the army nightclub hooked me up. Anyone know where I can get a copy of this amazing Ray Coniff song "If'n You Don't, Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ... and is under pressure to dig out a dead Owen soldier, but according to the golla he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he will drag him and kick him! Great stuff!
