I have never seen John Cassavetes' film two years ago when I first saw KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin film that I thought was interesting to say diplomatically, but not so rarely, I immediately wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I have tried - with an emphasis on proven - to follow his other work, especially SHADOWS. I have to admit that it took me a while to really enjoy the movie. Initially unpolished, raw and improvised, the way Cassavetes was shot, he tore me off a bit and thought of it as an original - absolutely - but erroneous and dated experiment. But now, after reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today. Shot at a minimum budget of $ 40,000 with a skeleton of six crew members, SHADOWS offers the observation of tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family, which are two of three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni ), blonde and able to go white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors keep their real names to reflect the real conflicts within the group, but they saw that the film was concerned about human problems as opposed to racial. Cassavetes made the film in ten minutes and jagged editing, responding to the "smooth" values ​​of Hollywood production. The main inspiration for Cassavetes - at least in the cinematographic style when the film was shot - was by Italian neo-realists and at the same time professed admiration for the pioneering spirit of Welles. The use of amateurs and improvisation could be similar to some of the Italian neo-realistic directors, but with his sharpened score of Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film, unlike everything it was before, really feels very different, very American. A song with feathered girls, "I feel like a lolly-pop" (or something) seems to me like light years back, old history. But no matter how old it might look, it still makes a wonderful time capsule from the late fifties New York today. I think it is one of the first films that aspiring filmmakers realize that they could make a standalone film without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who played and was involved in SHADOWS, claims it was Jules Dassin's NAKED CITY (1948). br /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 8/10
