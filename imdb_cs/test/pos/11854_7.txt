This independent film is worth seeing because of its creators' talent, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky directed the young cast, and he is to be praised for this effort. The film's premise is a warning story of danger to something that one cannot have. What's the story of Alice and Ed. After living together for a moment, Alice suddenly becomes uneasy because she imagines she is lacking in sex experience. Alice and Eda's relationship, although not an example of ideal happiness, is a convenient way to share one's life with each other. That is, until Alice and Claire, her sister, accidentally came across a sexual encounter of another couple who had no idea she was being watched. This event causes Alice to reevaluate her own sex life with Ed. ; finds that she is missing substance. When he suggests "seeing other people", Ed is shocked, to put it mildly, but he doesn't want to resist Alice, he decides to go on. Furthermore, Alice and Ed enter a world unknown to them. The people they eventually encounter are not worth the trouble. Unfortunately, at the end, they realize that they were created for themselves. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing to see the amazing Julianne Nicholson, which we liked in another independent film "Tully". Mrs. Nicholson reminds us of Shirley McLaine; she shows her light quality about her that it's hard to take her eyes out of her when she's in the scene. This young actress proves to be the perfect artist to become better with every new look. It basically carries the film. Her Alice is a contrast study. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she's insufficient in Ed's pleasure because of her inexperience. Jay Mohr, is an excellent match for Mrs. Nicholson. They both work wonders together. His Ed is completely trustworthy. We know people like him. Deep inside, there is a good person who suddenly finds himself in a situation he did not say, yet it is only to find out that he is too polite and uncontrolled to live a gratuitous sex with willing women. that have no problem with falling to hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is beautiful. Lauren Graham does an amazing job like Claire, sister of Alice. Andy Ritcher is also amazing as a grounded Carl, a stupid friend who finally finds fulfillment when he meets Penelope, a single mother. As Penelope, Helen Slater, she makes a film in the film that is very short, though short. <br /> <br /> The director is extremely gifted, undoubtedly going to places because he shows that he is suitable for work. .
