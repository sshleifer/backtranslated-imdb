are you crazy or what? This movie has the talent that you criticize the movie that was made by famous directors and producers? I mean, you have to watch some miserable version, because if you had the right version, you shouldn't think that its low resolution graphics should be .. <br /> <br /> this movie is for people who like Hong Kong cinema on the other side of what Asian people enjoy watching ... you are such a sale .. Hong Kong cinema is totally different from a cinema in Hollywood, cinema hk is in its own class ... <br /> <br /> so if you don't Enjoy watching movies from Hong Kong producers do not go and step on how it's a waste of time to watch .. just let other people make a movie .. <br /> <br /> and I personally saw this movie and I love his story and the way it was made.
