One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 1930s was a variation of the fiction of crimes known as "the secret of murder," because the addition of sound to films helped to make the film more faithful to what the audience experienced in the original. playing. And because the horror films were very popular in these years, by improving the horror elements of the conspiracy, mysterious murder films have seen almost the same popularity as it was in the previous decade (in which the first films of the genre were made). Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this renewed interest in mysterious murders the chance to make a name for himself, after Warner Bros chose his three-star play, "Wax Works", to create a 1933 horror movie, "The Wax Mystery Museum". to the independent film director Frank R. Strayer to make films, and "Ghost Walks" was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In "The Ghost Walks", John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play, Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house to read his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. asking for a refugee in an old mansion to become the property of one of Ames's acquaintances, in the house, Wood and Homer are witnessing a strange relationship between Ames and the homeowners, but that's all that is a plan to be impressed with wood: everyone in the house is an actor who plays a part in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder is done, and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake (after discovering Ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real killer. As expected by Charles Belden's screenplay for "The Ghost Walks", it presents the classic elements of mysterious stories about the murder of his time because we have a stormy night in an old dark house as an environment, a compulsory group of suspects and a touch of comedy. What is interesting, however, is how Belden makes the film a real spoof of the many twists that he plays in his story to play with the cliché of mysterious murder games. Dialogues are excellent, full of wit and cheerful spell, and although the plot certainly loses a lot of steam to the end (following the mysterious murder routine), thanks to its clever twists and the special of its unpredictable character. Interestingly, there is an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it never denigrating and it's really funny at times. In 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman on the poverty side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him some of his most exciting films and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. While this is of course happening on the budget and typical production values ​​of independent films of its time, Strayer manages to use his set to make an atmospheric film that fits perfectly into the mood and tone of the story. Stimulation is sometimes a little too slow, but Strayer knew that the strength of his film was on Belden's script and made it as much as possible, allowing his cast to make the most of their characters. Sure, the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal, but Strayer does an effective, though limited, work in this movie. As mentioned above, the scenario is full of great lines that make unpredictable characters and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage. Richard Carl is remarkably witty as the rough producer Herman Wood, who adds a lot of charm to his characters, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the charming secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives and hilarious performance as a cowardly yet witty assistant. John Miljan is as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing wonderful but nothing really bad, and the same could be said for June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (compulsory love) that is fine. However, Donald Kirke is really fun as Terry Shaw's harmful, and it's a shame he didn't get more time on the screen. As usual with Frank R. Strayer movies, a low budget hurts the film badly, while Strayer does the best he can, the movie still sometimes looks plain. But the main problem is the problem of the very slow pace it has, even if the film is filled with glittering moments of witty dialogues, it moves at a pace so slowly that it can become boring and boring for moments. It should also be said that while Miljan and Collyer are effective in their roles, they are very boring and mediocre compared to Arthur and Carl and wishes the film to be more focused on the comedy pair than on the main pair. Finally, as stated above, the end is so weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts, even though the loan must go to Belden for making the creative plot appear to the end. It could be said that Charles Belden is an unfinished hero of the murder mystery genre, because among the many horror and mysterious films that came out in B movie studios dubbed "The Series of Poverty", is "The Ghost Walks" easily among the best (alongisde Strayer's previous film "Vmapire Bat", despite his shortcomings. And although this is definitely not a masterpiece of this genre, it is a nice way to spend the night and enjoy the way it makes fun of its own origin as Mysterious Murder Game A highly recommended movie if you like the genre
