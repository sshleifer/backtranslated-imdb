That was one of the best half-hour horror / thrilling / fantasy performances of the eighties, no doubt. Granted the show had scarcely able to cast with each individual episode, and it smelled as far as production values ​​(ie Files) went, but damn it I have to give it some recognition for being a gutsy with charts. I think the plot of each episode was pretty sharp, that even me, a hard-boiled horror movie, a shock movie, and a 70s grind-house buff got a little angry and crept out. Great show, just great, no matter what other reviewers said. My favorite episode was "Bug House". Every time I think about it today, almost 20 years after the premiere premiere, it still gives me willies. Other shows like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were certainly better production values ​​- wise, but in my opinion they have nothing to do with conspiracy. Compared to this sick show! This definitely paved the way for an even more graphic cultic phenomenon that was "The Crypt Stories".
