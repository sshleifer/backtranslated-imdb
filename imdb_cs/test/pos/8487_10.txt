Jamie Foxx was the embodiment of Ray Charles. After a few moments, you will stop seeing the film and see the biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was indeed a genius of music, and the film portrayed it brilliantly. Nobody will ever or never write, play or record music like this music giant. When he passed through the body, the world lost one of America's greatest heroes. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a scholarship to a college college and could play as Ray was a benefit to the director. What could be better than that? You don't have to have a "double" piano and then try to split the screen from someone else's hand to Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also raised how heavy Ray was. He wasn't always a nice man. You haven't rooted it either. He was addicted to drugs, a woman, sometimes simple. But I think that's what made him genius, so I can't blame him. I'll pick Jamie for the best actor!
