No one can help but admire Mike Judge for his "approach". Almost everyone who works can connect with characters with "Office Space". "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling. One can easily appreciate the experience of our heroes 505 years later, as the director tried again to put things at a very human level. Rather similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this film is very humorous. Don't miss the scenes like "Fart Museum" is a classic. The Imaginative Comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is a wildly imaginative, extremely funny, and solid 8.0 movie experience. - MERK
