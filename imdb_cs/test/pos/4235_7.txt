The film is not taken seriously, and if you follow his lead you will have a lot of fun (if you don't mind your murder served really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)! This film blinks an eye at every horror fan and then gives them a finger. He knows it sucks and that's why it's far and far the best of the "Kids Play" series. It is played "tilted humor" angle so well, you will find yourself more than just laughing AT, but with it. And believe me, all the time you laugh, it laughs back atcha. <br /> <br />
