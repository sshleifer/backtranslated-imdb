There is no conspiracy. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the conventional narrative techniques used by mainstream film. However, Du Levande Roy Andersson is a remarkable film story. It is a touching view of the human psyche. Roy Andersson, a series of medallions, gives us an intimate look at what makes us human. In perfectly framed static shots, complemented by perfectly tuned but unpredictable musical shapes, Roy introduces us to a number of characters dedicated to their everyday existence. Some bordering on tragic, others cheerful, we are filmed on the Nordic road like no other. It's the way to the little things that make us human. Instead of telling the most popular narrative or visual technique, everything is stripped to the bare minimum, so our only focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the negligible points of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our despair. Through this simple observation of others we can accept who we are as individuals. Washed-out paints and deadly pale make-up characters seem to just emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, we're all alive. There is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this movie, but you will go out of the cinema with a sense of life. Much more affordable than his earlier film, Songs from Second Floor, Du Levande, is a really inspiring cinema.
