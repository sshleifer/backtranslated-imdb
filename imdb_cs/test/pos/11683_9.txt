If I assume you know what this film is about, I am also forced to assume that you have come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it no matter what I say. If all these circles are true - read on - you will probably find some agreement with at least part of this review. If you are undecided or unsure of what happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s in urban and suburban youth culture, you should probably read one of the reviews that pretend to be objective. Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I ever lived in. At the peak of hardcore I was immersed in about 1979-1981, everyone had a band and only common denominators between the groups and indeed members of their audience were: <br /> <br /> * Disapproval <br /> <br /> * Tolerance and the enjoyment of the difference <br /> <br /> * and the desire to have fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, resistance to authority, and violent slam-dance have not been an integral part of what I have experienced although there were certainly handles or factions that tended to be intolerant of those who weren't dressed, spoke or made punk. Some of these clich√©s have often received a certain amount of undeserved credit for those who truly tried to live the fascist paradigm of anarchist, suicidal, angry young cops. Although interviews with punks in Penelope Spheeris' excellent Cal-Punk documentary "Waste of Western Civilization" represent a very narrow view of the subculture some of us have enjoyed, conversations with bands, club owners, promoters and even even security people are much more representative of my own view and memories of the "scene". however, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudice about what punk is supposed to experience this film without having their prejudices challenged. Unfortunately, it is only the blame for those who support, believe or feel comfortable with the stereotypes - not the filmmakers. Don't blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone - not for most. It is not the coarsest, but it is loud, uncomfortable, fast and less concerned with technology than raw energy. For me it was clear that the early black flag with Ron Reyes, X, fear and circular tufts was much more expensive than the cost of this hard-to-earn film. Like I like The Germs when I see Darby Crash for the mess - and that nice guy - he left me a little cold. However, the scenes of Darby playing with his pet tarantula while "Shut Down" droned on and in the background were rare. X is also great. The straightforward documentary style of Spheeris is complemented by wild pelvis and proximity during music segments. Framing is used very nicely during the interviews to provide the context for what is said. Given her experience and budget, Spheeris did just as much as anyone could have with this movie. Recommended for those who appreciate what this film really is, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, a sincere, nameless rebellion before American punk was co-opted into the next stream of music and stereotypes became more important than basic philosophy.
