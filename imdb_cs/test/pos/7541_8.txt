Choose your destiny: Terrible squashes of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that include axes, or ... ummm ... well-developed girls of the sixth form that have recently discovered cigarettes, gin, sex, and how easily men can be misled . The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all in St. Trinian's, a remarkably easy English school for girls under the direction of Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton likes to point out, "In other schools, girls are broadcast completely unprepared into a ruthless world, but a ruthless world must be prepared when our girls leave." Miss Fritton sounded like watering Julie Child and Eleanor Roosevelt and she certainly has Sim's droll and comic genes. The Belles of St. Trinian's, a crafty, chaotic comedy from Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the verge of a financial disaster. Salvation can be at your fingertips when a rich sheikh sends his daughter to join the fourth form and get a proper English education. Sheik is also the owner of the horse and one of his racers, Arab Boy, is trained near the school for the race. It is only a matter of time before girls in the fourth form create a race pool and bet on an Arabian boy, while Miss Fritton adds to the fund what school she has left. (Most of the fourth form girls come from the gin they do in chemistry, then from the bottle and down the rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), the Cockney Repairman, to the distribution. "He has something ... I don't know what exactly," he says. Miss Fritton about sampling, "but to send a few bottles to my room." Miss Fritton, however, has her brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some means casting, also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker, who not only placed a bundle on another horse, but also has a daughter, and in the sixth form he placed an early mature Arabel to inform him, and the sixth form kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form took the horse back, Flash Harry joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth girls are determined that the Arab Boy did not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence, and arrived his gang of Homburg clothing, the parents go to their parents' day, and the Department of Education came to a very good inspector. Playtime. It's hard to say what is more dangerous, African spears or bombs out of flour. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns in the performance of the tour. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a huge breast, like long dresses with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with plenty of feathers. He takes everything that is happening, even the fourth former banging on something in the chemistry class and after a few minutes later hears the blast, the results. I told Bessie to be careful with the nitro-glycerine! She is firmly convinced that St. Trinian is a "gay arcad of happy girls". Sim was one of Britain's greatest eccentric actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so small) girls who are doing horrible things, they are delighted with the film.
