The writers of the lost have overcome. The second season finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first season finals. Locke's lack of faith not only led to spiritual consequences for himself, but to the tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal was a success for him, but can he escape from the island? He would have to, if he wanted to stay alive. I have no doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. This finale left more questions than the previous finals; and I can't wait to fall. <br /> <br /> Side note: What's the point of sending a review so all spoilers are listed? Where is the pleasure of breaking the surprise for everyone else? The current review on this site is nothing but a big fat spoiler fest, poorly built in barely legible English with the explicit purpose of making someone crazy. Good work.
