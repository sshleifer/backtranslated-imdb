It is always a pleasure to see the characters in the film, who are completely good-hearted and well-informed, even if they are surrounded by those who are not. The slightly stupid premise of the film is that the conservative, religious family of Franklin (mother, father, teenage boy and girl) is involved in an accident where parents and brothers have a near-death experience during which they encounter Jesus, pleasant but somewhat irritated. a soul that removes the burden of "original sin" from them. When they return to their lives, many of their opinions and attitudes have changed, much to the dismay of the daughter who did not share this experience. The religious party is, I think, presented with good balance, from good (Jesus) to terribly horrible (those of his "followers" who are obsessed with the sins of others and completely forget their own). It's a movie that will convince you, give you some good laughs along the way and leave you with a pleasant feeling that the world can be a nicer place than you think.
