Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. When my mom first told me that I was 7 and Saint Anna was just the holy I had for My Holy Communion. My mom knew, so she told me to follow her. I did it and I saw it many times because it's really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the one who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So, there were a lot of actors we saw in TV shows too. There is a bad guy who is trying to steal the house away, and Sally is still trying things out with St. Anne to help raise money to keep the house. It includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays her older brother. This is a good and fun movie that I still love.
