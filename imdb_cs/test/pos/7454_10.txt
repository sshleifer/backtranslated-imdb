"Duckman" is a great show. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old and after school I hurried home and turned to Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I LOVED IT !! It's such a fun and great show. Created by Klasky-Csupo, who are great cartoon makers. They revived some of my favorite shows ever, such as "The Simpsons" and "Rugrats". I've seen a lot of episodes of this show and I think they're all really funny and sweet. Voice actors did a great job and also voiced characters. I wish Comedy Central could return this show along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert." But this is a great Comedy Central show. Great work, Klasky-Csupo!
