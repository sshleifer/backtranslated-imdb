This is the 13th Falcon movie. Tom Conway has lost none of his humor and style and shows no signs of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story, with lots of red herring, suspects and dames. Madge Meredith is a good girl of the story, playing it adequately, but by no means putting the screen on fire. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she puts a stone on a great face, with the eyes of an agate, and you're just waiting for as many people to kill her as she can. Edward Brophy is back when Goldie is sidekick, but surprised to see his manic exaggeration stop and he is in control. This is a great tribute to William A. Berke's directorial skills, who have made so many Westerns that no nonsense was probably prepared from Brooklyn's dummy. The result is that for the first time, perhaps in his career, Brophy was relieved enough to actually add anything to the film rather than try the viewer's patience with the irritating behavior of retarded but unruly six years old. It all goes very well and is fun.
