It is not an easy movie that should initially appeal to both main characters, but fortunately the film's heart and soul is the moving performance of Paul Sage, who moves the film into unexplored waters and transcends a rather unpleasant plot. This gives the film a true truth and makes you think you saw something special (7/10)
