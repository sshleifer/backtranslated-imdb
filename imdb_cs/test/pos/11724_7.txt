Burt Reynolds' riposte to Clint Eastwood, who hit his peat bog and his orangutans comedy, was to create his own Dirty Harry in a Chicago-style thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally designed for John Boorman, but at the conclusion of the director himself, this is an out-and-out commercial package with Reynolds who gets to the Vice Squad (literally - they're in the basement), who is nailing the mysterious crime lord who is support Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can estimate the rest, but while Reynolds tends to lose sight of the story occasionally has a good eye for each scene and almost gets the performance from the Rachel department as a high-class hooker on which it falls. The romantic subplot is unusually well-developed, there are a few good action scenes and a few nice touches, such as Vittoria Gassman's look at the villain mirror of the hero's image or Reynolds and the killer who witnesses from neighboring apartments in the same space. building. One of the best star movies of his famous days, it's not a classic, but it makes it more than an effective Saturday night special.
