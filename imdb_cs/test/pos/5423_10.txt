... the world will never know. (The film that took the "best animated short" Oscar that year, "Anna and Bella" is very good, but it's not "Big Snit." Both are available on Expanded Entertainment's "World's Greatest Animation" compilation, that you "Snit" and his director Richard Condie are attracting so much attention that it is little for me, but I would like to note that the film contains one of my favorite "shots" in a short animated movie where a man opens the door to leave the cat. I do not want to give away the current events I have seen here, but when I first saw the shot, I was from one mood to the other, then a few seconds later, that shot never affected me so much. This set of moments, "The Big Snit" deserves a mark of "masterpiece".
