On March 17, 1974, a man is found dead in toilets in Manhattan's Penn Station. Although he is known, he cannot be identified because he scratched the personal data in his passport and his body is in the city morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider to be one of America's greatest architects of the twentieth century, Louis I Kahn. He died at the age of 73 on the road from India, where one of his biggest projects is approaching, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad. One of the most influential post-war American architects Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes the House of Parliament in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Kimbell Art Museum in Forth, Yale Art Gallery, Salk Institute in California, and some sort of mobile "barge" designed for concerts in ports. various cities around the world. While celebrating as an architect, very little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn survived two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng and their two children. All three families lived a mile apart in the suburbs of Philadelphia, but their travels never crossed until the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of the film, was only 11 years old at that time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn buildings, talking to relatives and colleagues, and visiting places that have played a role in Louis Kahn's life. The most moving confrontation is when Nathaniel asks his mother, landscape architect and Mrs. Louis Kahn, why she continued playing the second violin to his wife and never confronted him with this. Tears slipped through her eyes, but she didn't regret. "It was worth it." It is such an intensely sad moment. She's obviously broken, treated at his funeral as an outcast who was forbidden to walk, it's almost as if she had a spare life. It all seems strangely unreal. Another conversation with Edward Bacon, the architectural nemesis of Kahn, who was in charge of rebuilding his native Philadelphia in the 1950s and 1960s, is almost suffering from a stroke when he reminds him of Kahn's disgusting images of architecture. His son Nathaniel listens uncomfortably when Bacon's superior literally screams with anger when Kahn's name comes. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's greatest work, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The completion of the vast and extraordinary building took 23 years to be very proud of Bangladeshi. It is one of the few national symbols with a character in this impoverished nation. Some of the conversations with the locals brought tears in my eyes, especially when they found out that they were talking - God forbade - his own architect son! The film is such a personal way to describe Kahn's great architectural heritage and is primarily about making the film itself and filmmaking in general. Maybe Louis I. Kahn shook his father as a father, but these shortcomings in his personal life are an interesting portrait for this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
