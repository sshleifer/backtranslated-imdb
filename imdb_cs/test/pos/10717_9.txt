KRAMER VS KRAMER has won five Oscars, including the 1979 Best Picture. An intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising manager whose life is turned upside down when his eight-year-old wife leaves him and lets him take care of his son. build a relationship with him that he never had. Robert Benton's vigorous screenplay presents us with faulty but real human beings with hearts, souls and brains. For example, in a scene where Joanna tells Ted that he is leaving him, he just doesn't get tired of the door ... giving him the keys, credit cards, dry cleaning ticket, telling him which accounts have been paid, and informing him that she has withdrawn from her bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no longer. This decision to leave was not a whim ... it was about it and Joanna felt she had no choice but to leave if she left, she did it right ... and without a special plan in mind, he didn't think it was right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man who was so obsessed with bringing bacon home, he had no idea that his life had broken into pieces at home. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, an unhappy woman who feels sympathy at the beginning of the movie, but that she changes all when she comes back for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form. I've always torn up why his mom left and does it all in the whispering phase, or when she meets Joanna after returning and kills her drink in the wall (Hoffman's) when he tries to explain Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar-nominated). the moment is not in a scenario that Streep wasn't told to get to a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes like Billy, a confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who changed the devotion to the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama, but even here he is laughing ... Billy and the chocolate ice cream ... Billy pouting because Ted raises him to a party ... JoBeth Williams) on his way to the nude naked but it's moments The Human Drama You Remember ... Ted runs through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get ready after BIlly falls off the jungle gym ... Ted fired just before he started his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he says the guy whispering ... "Shame on you." And of course, the final where Joanna tells Ted she doesn't take Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all those problems, want to claim custody, and then just change her mind? But this is a little quarrel about the amazing movie, masterly director Robert Benton and a flawlessly executed top-cast cast. You must see.
