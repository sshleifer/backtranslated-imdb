They are just stories, some wish us to do it, some that never happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. Places and naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, I thought that creating a real movie takes more than just beauty. Then, of course, the film unfolds. Stories move except Sophie Marceau can't tell her story in this movie. But Malkovich plays both stories. Voiceover does not link stories, but will help Malkovich raise some thoughts. <br /> <br /> I'd say it's worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I've seen. Because of his age - remarkable!
