Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count. In what was just a forerunner of what was supposed to come, Murray controls the screen in what can only be described as a comic mastery. Tripper Harrison is one of the biggest comedy characters in the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, clever when he has to be, strict when he needs to be, and taking care when he suits, Murray gives Tripper that SNL flash in the eye. CIT only in wonder when he crouched under the comic genius Mr. Murray. Summer is not summer without observing Meatballs. One of the best comedies ever on screen.
