This is probably the best film by director Hector Babenco. It shows Brazilian reality to an unknown stranger, which is the same reality that haunts all Latin American countries, poverty and survival instinct. The most affected in this reality are children usually abandoned orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents must do it in a "dog eating dog" society many times fall into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with the approach of "no curls", this movie will get you to you, a great storyline storyline, must have a movie on someone's collection. The main role was played by Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell into a criminal wave, killed a few years later during a robbery. I would recommend people watch the movie "Who Killed Pixote?" so you can have a deeper picture of these characters' lives. Some other characters from the movie have a similar fate, some have died and others are in jail. However, this movie will take a long time to remember
