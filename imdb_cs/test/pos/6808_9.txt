Sentimental, heart-pulling family movie in the 1920s. Young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter the Grand National; ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is fortunately to help Liz. Director Clarence Brown shows some remarkable control with material that might be excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves are very careful to make the stories and create a natural story. It is true that there are one or two scenes that seem a little forced, but overall it is quite influential and beautifully filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite exciting and like many great classics, there is an amazing, three-hankie fade-out at the end. Liz proves she was a real soldier right from the start, and Rooney - which I usually find rather uncomfortable - is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is scary because Liz's grumpy father and Angela Lansbury are pleased to see her older, boy-mad sister. Most of the acting kudos, however, include Anne Revere, who won the lavishly meritorious support actress Oscar to play Liz's wise and caring mother.
