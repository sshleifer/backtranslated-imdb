It's not far from the basket that Bollywood normally does, but that's just something really good. <br /> <br /> The title track is one of Bollywood's finest and haunted. This is one of the movies (along with Baazigar - he has to see Bollywood movie) made by Shah Rukh Khan and it's to check it out. More reviews give away the story - that's a pretty basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions at the end made me give this movie another star. Her rather cheesy but definitely worth seeing if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
