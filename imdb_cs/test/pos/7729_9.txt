Excellent movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda managed to display the time (1830) with careful care. Light, places, feel, are perfectly perceived from the very beginning of the film. And along with that - as opposed to what happened to "Mad Love" (Juana la Loca), a somewhat episodic historical film - all of this beautiful photo / music / clothing packs a very smooth scenario that reaches its peak in the only possible As for the actor, Paz Vega as Carmen is excellent: liar, seductive, aggressive, absolutely sexual, so beautiful Carmen. Sbaraglia is a somewhat less persuasive audience about his immediate crazy love for Carmen, but succeeds in giving the film a proper tragic mood. I recommend to all: the best Spanish movie of the year.
