I saw a few episodes of "The Eleventh Hour", but I have to say that it was enough for me. This series is so impressive and interesting ... I'll definitely follow. First of all, I have to say that acting is excellent. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - credibly and coolly and believes the audience in character. Other characters like Rachel are also believable, and although they are sometimes a bit cold - given how the show is being filmed - they are interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning and one who tried to clone people. The way the episode was developed and how Ian - Stewart - followed the tracks and rescued people, was amazing. In addition to thinking about ethics and how good or bad it might be. By the way, I think it's one good TV show. I just hope it will be like this - interesting, provocative and with good behavior. Although it is shot in such a cold way - small flashes, cold photos, lots of details - it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommended.
