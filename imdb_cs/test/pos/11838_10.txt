This 1931 comedy improves with every tracking thanks to Marion Davies' comedy talents and C. Aubrey Smith's amazing performance. Smith plays a grumpy old man who collects his adult children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. One is American (Davies), one English (Ray Milland who looks about 18), and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves along with Ralph Forbes (not at all appeal) of the fall for Davies. Davies and Smith are just beautiful and very touching. Davies also gets a couple of dances and makes a few "big" entrances. And of course Davies is just amazing. Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence co-star. If they gave Oscar support in 1931, Smith could be nominated. It is simply excellent in this jewel.
