This picture was released in May 1979 by Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most beautiful comedy sections in the history of the disaster, in the fairy tale, the fianc√©es of the young lovers meet in a fairy tale about nurse fights, which stop at anyone who leaves everything out. So what does H.O.T.S mean? You'll have to watch a movie to get an answer. You see, girls have problems with company girls on campus that make them nothing but sexual maniacs. That is why girls went to discredit the girls of society, no matter what they have to do to do the job. Besides, in this mess is a college dean who wants to break down a group of girls before getting out of control. I loved this movie especially by Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I was disappointed she didn't get any other acting work. Based on the three friends themselves, I give this film to 10 weasel stars.
