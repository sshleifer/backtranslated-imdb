In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of Gisaburo carrier (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiya (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisabura and the plot with Seki to kill him. Strangling Gisabura and launching his body into a well in the forest, Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo has moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki pursues his spirit. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisabura. "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. The remorse and the Seki wine complex force her to see the spirit of her murdered husband, spoil the perfect conspiracy of her lover. Cinematography is threatened by the quality of VHS released in Brazil, but there are very beautiful scenes, including "Ring" and the American remake of "The Ring" to use the view of the well from the inside at the same angle. The performances and directing are excellent to "Ai no Borei" a great movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("Empire of Passions")
