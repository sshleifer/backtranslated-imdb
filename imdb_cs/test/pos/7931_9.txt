Watching some of the sequences (erroneous, the whole 1/3 of the film dedicated to the Battle of the Ice) in Alexandru Nevsy, a film by the director of Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-author of Dmitry Vasilyev in his only significant role) credit), I realized how much he must go to overhead, at least on such a scale. If I were a member of the evaluation group at the time of this film, I would probably give Eisenstein a director of the year award, posthumously. It is such a crazy move of the film genius that he will be able to pull out some of the things that will be downloaded in the film, though for someone like this director after he left his best work - Potemkin Battleship and October - it might have been something what he taunted at first. But in the midst of a film that is sometimes a bit frustrating with how little grayness comes into a black-and-white subject, it's still a celluloid miracle almost 70 years later. Lord of the Rings fans to talk to grandfather movies. <br /> <br /> To say that something is a propaganda piece, it already gives connotation and often bad. It is something that has a full message to it and a look. It is still a matter of hot debate (see the horrors of arguments about Moore's films for evidence) about whether great art can come out of something that is point-blank that aims to wake the audience in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. At a time when World War II was approaching and Russia again faced "German invaders," and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was indeed commissioned to create this film as a challenge for the Russians to never forget a vital piece of their history. The end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from see battleship and October, however; If nothing else gets in these films, Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and content can finally come together for the viewer, which can completely overlook the viewer without failure. Under these conditions, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. But even though the whole idea of ​​"Russia is great, the Germans are bad", there are times when things are made a little less stringent, a little less strict to these ideals. For example, when we first see Germans in Privka, they are not some anonymous blobs who are totally barbaric and have blind intentions (not that they should not do what they want). They also have their own national pride that there would be nothing less than anything they could be told by their Christian masters. At least, picture evil has a face, however held at low low for a more prevalent side kicking in. There is also a short scene, before the ice-shooting battle, where the Russian band's joke is being. he said and laughed, adding a little more depth where little could be rare elsewhere. Because more often than not in Alexander Nevsky, with his battle songs loaded with pride in warfare, there are no complexities to characters, most notably Nevsky himself (played in ultra-heroic fashion, just interviewing near launch, Nikolai Cherkasov), which may have to be this way in Eistenstein's intention to have him as one infallible force to be counted in the story. After all, looking for naturalism in Eisenstein's film is like trying to find non-bastard pork legs for delicacies. But the real reason to see the picture is not acting, however, but for the appearance of the film as it moves and takes in the vast environment that Eisenstein interprets. On an epic scale, it is as ambitious as its 20 films, with a number of supplements not only in the main battle scenes, but also in urban scenes, hundreds of people rolling. In fact, I would say that any director working in Hollywood or elsewhere who thinks he is doing some huge epic, especially war, would do very well to look at this movie, even with the sound. It's even better if you think it's a silent movie, with visual highlights occasionally highlighted. One could spend a month analyzing the battle on the ice as it begins with German soldiers far and then coming as bugs, and then as Eisenstein walks between the close-ups of the actors who fight and then the wide shots. and with sped-up editing. And, of course, one cannot compromise on music, Sergei Prokofiev brings one of the greatest dozens of epic works. All the while the director's edition keeps our eyes moving, along with this frantic action at a fast pace. If it were just a short film, it would certainly fit in with the great, just like the Odessa Stairs sequence. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than absolutely amazing, it would be because of the errors that come from the director, who is much more suited to the quiet media than to the sound. While I haven't seen Ivan the Terrible yet, one of my negative criticisms would be his direction of actors, who is really as wide as he can, with a melodram on such a high stage as he stuns (a partial plot of two soldiers fighting for Olga are the best But even considering this, Alexander Nevsky is generally too extraordinary to ignore him, and he will engage in action and filmmaking to a level that sets the standard for movies today to try to live.
