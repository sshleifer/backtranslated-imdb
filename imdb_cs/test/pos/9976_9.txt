When thinking about golf movies, you mean Caddyshack, but what if there are kids? Go for this movie! Disney used is a proven formula to make a movie that adults and kids will enjoy. Acting in this film, in my opinion, is pretty good and the cast is largely very young! This movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique, seeing all the angles of the golf game. I think this movie should be for some academic prizes for editing a movie or something like that, because the entire flow of film is top. Though the end can be a bit predictable, the movie does well alone! It also shows that you don't need swearing, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
