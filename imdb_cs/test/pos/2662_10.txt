This movie is definitely one of the biggest movies ever made. It is a story told at a steady pace, which is usually not said by words but by means of film expression. The perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music brings to life the creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetic ways. The story itself is quite simple at first glance. As the name suggests, there is an archetypal path, a theme repeated for thousands of years. This motif has always been used not only to display the way in space and time, but also beyond, but has also a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. It's not just a person's odyssey; it is the odyssey of our species. The film itself is great, but in my case the impression of it will always mix with that of the book. I read it at the age of 10, I really don't think of problems as "what is the relationship between human evolution and the development of human morality." But the impression was big enough to make me fall for the entire science fiction genre. On the day I learned that '2001' has only Oscar special effects and wasn't even nominated for the best picture was the day when 'Academy' became two words that meant nothing .
