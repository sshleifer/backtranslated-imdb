I saw this movie on television in the UK about 25 years ago and has since resonated with me. My interest has recently been restored by visiting Hilton Head - another island of "Yamacraw" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent "The Water is Wide". With the advantage of knowledge, I reconsidered Conrack and considered it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some precision - a Hollywood rarity. There are three things I still have to say about this story: 1. The issue of poor and non-free and inclusive education is still the same. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These children were my peers, in 1969 I was 6 years old when Pat Conroy spent his year at Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why didn't it go to DVD yet?
