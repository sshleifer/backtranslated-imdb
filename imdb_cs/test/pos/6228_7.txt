In the middle of nowhere a group of friends breaks (one has a tire, the other a Jeep does not start mysteriously). One of them takes the tire at the gas station and that's the last one to see it. When the remaining four are looking for a friend, they meet a nice Mr. Slaussen, who offers jeep repair assistance and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat of his equally running house of the hermit. very realistic looking dummy. He goes with one guy in the party to work on the car and leave 3 girls in the house. Before he sets out, he warns them not to leave and go to the house behind the hut; he warns them of "Davy", his brother lurking and not there. Of course, one of them decides to embark on a job phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? Dummies? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, good girl two shoes, curiosity to get better people and never work out!), But stands apart from the rest of the 70s genre in its twist end. I started to regret Slaussen (Chuck Conners is an amazing, creepy, over-top-performance) at a point in the movie, and almost see the character of Molly doing the same. It's a jewel if you can find it; When I was younger, I stretched it out of the cable and went through a video store where I noticed a copy of VHS that was totally overpriced but worth it. Tanya Roberts fans will not be disappointed either. The best part of the movie for me was the soup scene (and biscuits !!) <br /> <br /> I gave her 7 because some movies were and still are difficult to explain.
