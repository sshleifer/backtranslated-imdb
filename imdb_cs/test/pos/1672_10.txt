If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston, he also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was before his time, who suffered a lot from his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved to be greater than the same people who contributed to his demise of Hollywood. "Rififi" is an elegant movie in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel to see how he could transform it into a film that became a classic classic. Jules Dassin was in Paris without money when he discovered a city that would serve as a basis for his film. Bad weather paid off to Mr. Dassin because the streets were always wet and there was no need to do much to show them. When we first met Tony, he plays cards. Tony seems to be in bad health; coughing all the time and sweating abundantly. After losing all his money, he goes to see Jo, the Swede, who tells him about the possibility of a robbery in Maupin & Webb, a fantastic jewelry store in Paris. The idea is passed by Mario, who designs Cesar, a Milan expert, a safe cracker. Tony, who recently came out of jail, learns that Mado, his former lover, is now with Grutter, a creep who owns a nightclub. After confronting Mad, instead of love, she feels she is scornful, and the meeting ends badly and throws her out of place. Grutter has no love for Tony, who is his natural enemy for his connection with Mad. When the day comes, the gang is able to get to the apartment building, where the second floor is located, directly above it. jewelry store owner lives but is gone. Everything is fine and the gang gets rid of gems. Cesar, a Milanese man, a typical lady, takes the ring as a souvenir, which in turn gives the chanteuse in Grutter's nightclub. This tactical error is a spark that reveals a well thought out plan. Jean Servais made excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who might have done the last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director, Jules Dassin, are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, thieves of the jewelry quartet. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with subdued intensity. Robert Hussein, who would later go on direct films, impressed with his Remi, one of Grutter's men. The best film benefit is the great work of Philippe Agostini, who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the national environment from which all these criminals operate. The music of Georges Auric plays well with the action in the film. Jules Dassin was special in the selection of films he directed, and unfortunately, this is our loss, because this man was a genius who proved to be particularly successful in "Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rififi".
