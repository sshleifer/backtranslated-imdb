No music. No stupid masala. A fairly realistic depiction of a police system in India and based on a real "meeting" of a specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals lead "Sadhu Agash" killed "- you already know that the bit) Brilliance radiates Nan Patekar in the role of a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. .One of the movies from Ram Gopal Vermas Factory.Movies that are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artwork included. <br /> <br / > What's great is telling stories is relaxed and finally introduces (in Indian film) how the police network works, but seriously, one insert is funny as hell (even if I don't know if the subtitled version will look funny) Cannes edition, which is interesting, made by the debut director Shamit Aman (I think it's his name). Again 55 years old Nana Patekar i She's brilliant from his stupid shouts from the past, I just show There is what a good director can do with a good actor, really good things, if you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted with the nonsense of some of our people's food, then it's definitely a relief. Again, Patekar is a man who happily carries a film on his shoulders and embodies the style of film - relaxed, entertaining, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, good acting, nice direction, all in all great things. Recommendation: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma (both Indian flicks)
