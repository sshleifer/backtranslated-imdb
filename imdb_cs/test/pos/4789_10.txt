Every time this film ended in late night television at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, I always took the time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see the beautiful Kate Jackson, handsome Richard Long, "great" Polly Bergen, whom I've never seen anywhere except this TV movie, cute Tom Bosley and another "big" I've never seen outside this movie, Celeste Holme. This is really a love ship for sailing to murder and chaos and the boy has always been good! And every time I looked at it, I always forgot who the real killer was. As expected, somebody here already criticizes the movie as if it really was a big help to anyone. This is a great TV movie and it's worth watching every time. I can't say about half of the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever watch TV once, which is unlikely, watch it. In the light of "The Girl Most Likely To" will finally come out this year on DVD, maybe there is hope for the release of the DVD "Death Cruise".
