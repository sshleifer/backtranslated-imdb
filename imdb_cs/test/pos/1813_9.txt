One of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 1980s, Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage starring. Deborah Foreman is fun as the object of Cage's desire (and what happened to her). Check out the veterans of the actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest as Julie's hippie parents - they're pretty funny!
