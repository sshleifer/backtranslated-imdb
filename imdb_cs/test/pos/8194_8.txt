For the feature film, the storyline closely follows the history - or at least historical gossip. But the Chinese, who know the story very well to see him again and again, would never tolerate it. The attention to detail is amazing, especially for anyone who has read Simy Qian's account in historian's records. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, really tried to live Qin Shi Huang at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions General Fan's head as well as a dagger wrapped in a map, as well as a dagger thrown into a brass column. Although Jing Ke is described as no stranger to swordplay, he is hardly an invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is really the weakest link in this movie. In fact (again according to Simy Qian) he was a heavy drinker and put aside his visit to Qin as long as possible and spent a lot of time with the ladies of Yan before the Crown Prince finally set off for him. . In short, he was a human being, and he was not looking forward to death, even though he was willing to accept it. Jing Chen Kaige is afraid of death, but not his own. He is a classic, unscrupulous murderer who has changed a disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps only affection) for a woman and sympathy for several hundred children that Zheng buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed it was done by Qin Shi Huang, though there is a legend about the burying of 460 Confucians) their neck and then staple them enough to make this former assassin kill again. Melodrama is not convincing and the character simply ends up being boring. Here it is not shabby, though not very interesting due to character. As for Lady Zhou, she will never come in all the numerous stories I have heard about Qin Shi Huang. But Gong Li is so familiar to the Americans that they have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yima) and there has to be an interest in love, so here she is. It is unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as the character of Jing Ke. She is much better (for example in Qiu Ju) when she is fine; there is hardly a presence here. All this, however, is trivial compared to Li Xuejian's extraordinary behavior as Cheng itself. Rather, Qin Shi Huang is what is for us Milton's Satan: accepted as a villain, but noble. Qin Shi Huang's accomplishments radiate respect for over two thousand years to date, and Li captures his terrifying will without endangering his humanity. The power of Li is enough, but the scope of the movie is great, although the photo is intentionally drab. She feels ancient. The score is adequate, barely moving, though very suitable for action. Although I only saw it once, I believe that Chen Kaige should get more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. Opening credits are exciting. If five stars are absolutely average, I gave three more for acting Li Xuejian and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
