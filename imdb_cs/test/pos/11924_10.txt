I loved this movie because I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenage teenager. I'm 23 now and I still love this movie. The best part about who I love dating too is because it is a total macho-guy movie! It is forged with enough action and chaos to give men with the shortest attention span stuck on the screen. I wish it was available on DVD!
