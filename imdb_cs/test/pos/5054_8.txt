I was pleased to see that my husband rented "Labyrinth of Passion". I like Almodovar's films. We both loved film. We both couldn't stop laughing. In particular, we enjoyed the scene in which a transvestite is shooting a photographic novel, and when he is reportedly threatened by an electric drill killer, he is told to answer the phone and say, "I can't talk to you now, I'm being attacked by a sadistic serial (That would mean that she would take note of the message from the big answering machine.) We also loved the lady who told her she found her new loved ones, "I went to the orgy after the concert, but I couldn't stop thinking about you. "(Waiting to use this line on Twitter)." Labyrinth of Passion "is a swaying farce with lots of high jinks, cheerful dialogue and eye candy for everyone. I would give him 10 out of 10 ratings, but I give him 8 for two reasons, the first being a scene that includes laxatives that include a shot of a lady who pollutes herself: utterly useless, and for a moment The second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with her father: shocking, yes, but again, it destroys the film's tone. Still, I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun time.
