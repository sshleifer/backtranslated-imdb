I have enjoyed this film immensely, thanks to the incisive scenes (witty and ironic, some even "tragic"), believable performances, witty dialogue and heartfelt rendering of what is or may be like hetero- and / or homosexual & beware of fulfilling your desires. I am aware of this paradox: homo- and n-hetereosexualâ€¦ that is what the film deals with at the end, but never uses it for caricature. If you are just as open, it seems that the people who created the film do not matter if those who are in each other's hands are of the same sex or not. "Mr. Smith" from Matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay-salesman with "weird" flavors here, but that's not the only thing you can wonder about. enjoy.....
