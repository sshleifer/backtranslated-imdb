Starring Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This movie is a classic family favorite. At least for most of my family members. One of us looks at the mention of this film and thinks, "What's a stupid movie." But I'm not the man. I still think this movie is very funny. I was watching him last night with someone who had never seen him, and I laughed as hard as when I first saw him. It's still very funny for me. Naval Captain Tom Dodge is a little black sheep in the Navy. He's the kind of guy who's gonna play golf while he plays on the golf course. It's the kind of guy who gets drunk, walks and wakes up with a hangover and a tattoo on his dongle. He's not the kind of guy who wants to be a sub commander. But Dodge is at the end of the line. He has placed a number of orders in the applications to control his own sub-subject, and if he does not get a subordinate this time, he heads to the desk, which means it's for maritime life. The Admiralty decides to give it its own ship, but does not give it a new nuclear sub. They give him oil, an ancient memory of World War II. His mission is to clean her up and take her to the Atlantic for a war game. Dodge seems to be a little frustrated to have such a lousy ship that was given to him when he worked so hard that he was on, so he goes and talks to Admiral Winslow (Torn). Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel is still being sold in the real world, to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a fugitive captain in oil came to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Could they do that? Dodge and most Admiralty don't think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, why he invented this war game. Dodge's mission is to take Stingray to the sea and try to escape the US nuclear navy and blow up US naval bases. In a simulated battle, of course. So, it's about as deep as the plot gets. This is not a chart driven movie. It's a stupid movie that's just a big gag. It makes fun of yourself, and you are not expected to take it seriously. If you are looking for a good silly laugh on Friday night, I urge you to try it out. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: 3 of 4 (worth seeing)
