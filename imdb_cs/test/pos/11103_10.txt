There is something about true stories that make them more interesting than fiction. I think it's the fact that truth has always been alien than fiction. Falcon and Snowman tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual, attempting to find employment that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealistic son to work in the defense department. Boyce has little responsibility and seems to be happy with drinking and deleting with his co-workers. However, as time goes by, Boyce begins to learn top secret information that makes him doubt his government's morale. Boyce's idealist soon sees the CIA's illegal operations in all places in Australia. Finally, Boyce decides to release some of the secret information he is dedicated to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's fault is the assumption that because the US is doing bad things, the USSR is a good person. Over time, Boyce and his buddy pharmacy Lee (Penn) begin to sell their secret KGB information. What was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performance of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, they both soon find themselves in an endless descending spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not just a great movie, but one of my favorite favorites.
