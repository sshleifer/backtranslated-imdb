It's a mystery to me, why wasn't I able to get into this masterpiece from my pocket? so far he has turned to noir, but I am glad to announce that it did not disappoint. I haven't seen any of Jules Dassin's American movies for several years, but I'm likely to return and watch "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" again. Jean Servais, a name I don't know, but a face that is somewhat familiar in his fatigue and cold, has recently completed a lengthy stay in jail and, like in these movies (hey, otherwise it wouldn't story) to cope with direct life well. Opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million-dollar jewel heist that can be done at night without fear of discovering several men. The tense shooting of a robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what people of course remember most of the film, and it's really remarkable; but I liked the half-finished location of the last shootout as soon as the robbery owes to the great mouth of one of the thieves; superb portrayal of courageous parties in Paris in black and white; and Servais' direction of Eddie Constantin and Humphrey Bogart in his free but brutal performance. It may be too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really lives up to its reputation as pure fun, even though what it has to say about human status is not exactly deep or provocative ; George Auric is a modernist, romantic and jazz score is another highlight.
