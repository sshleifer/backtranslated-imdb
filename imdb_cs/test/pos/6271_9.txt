This Blade Master movie can be a cheap, clumsy look and sometimes it is, but it shares thoughts of problems that are beyond the time this movie is set. Ator is the chosen one who must protect the Earth from a terrible weapon that is compared to an atomic weapon in a unique and unpredictable way. He goes through obstacles like a conscientious figure who is more than muscle power, though he has enough. I would say that this aspect of the film surpasses a film like Conan, a barbarian, which is the least I can say, absolutely thoughtlessly. It is by no means diminishing the great adventure film Conan, but it gives Ator his health that he does not share with the barbarian. For a movie with a lower budget, this movie does well in terms of environment and fighting is mostly credible. Zor, the villain, has one of the most interesting psychological confrontations with the prisoner throughout the film, even though Ator seems to be too fit for the task to relax. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie a little extra are those scenes that may look unpredictable but worth mentioning. Fighting the snake god, though a huge puppet, is well controlled because the snake with good lightning remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The film culminated in the most unusual way, quite anachronically, but stunningly: deltaplane. The scene itself is not properly introduced, unread at all, where Ator came to this machine, it is quite unconvincing, but it leads to a truly poetic and beautiful sequence, which in itself is a culminating point in a film that elevates Ator. a place where there were few human fantasy heroes. <br /> <br /> If the Blade Master isn't one of the great fantastic movies of all time, it's not a surprise because of its shortcomings, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way in which it confronts the good and the evil, the heart shows that this film is so relentless. I suggest it for every genre fan and try to take it seriously as an intelligent film that needs to be taken more seriously than it seems.
