I don't think I'll include spoilers, but if so, I can cover my ass. "The Last American Maid" came at a time when such teenage age / college sex romps were rave. Films like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and popular "Porky's" (1981) made money mucho. Yet it is the "last American virgin" who actually has a more serious story of conspiracy amidst nudity and sexual situations. It is often the story of three high school friends who want to lose their virginity. Go to bad places (prostitutes), dangerous (older woman with jealous friend) and comfortable (lure your high school female counterparts). The film has a lot of funny moments, and although the cast didn't produce one major movie star, it's worth recalling the fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey, and more. According to today's standards, it is rattling and can have caught NC-17 ratings, but it's a well-narrated story about how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain, while love can be right in front of us. It's a small piece of America from the 1980s and it's worth having in your movie collection.
