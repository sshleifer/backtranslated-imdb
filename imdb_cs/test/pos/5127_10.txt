I saw the movie "Hoot" and then immediately decided to comment. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. Some people think that if they have money they can do what they want, which is probably, but if they think more about the future, they think they would do something useful! This film is not just about children, this film shows us that children are usually the ones who care more than adults. When I was twelve, I saw some water lilies, and I knew they were protected by the law and did not even dare to touch them, not to fear the law, but they feared that I might actually harm them. (I am currently 15) What ever was great acting, 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in the movie !!! and enjoy it!
