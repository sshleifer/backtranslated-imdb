This is one worth watching, though it is sometimes cheesy, it is great to see young Sean Astin, and it ends up being a pretty funny and funny action movie. I looked at it many times when I was young and now I enjoyed it when I pop into old vhs into the machine (I happen to own a copy). So sit down with this movie, let the reality go for a moment and you'll have the chance to have a few good laughs and a nice hour and a half.
