This film, adapted from Sam Shepard, retains many gaming features such as the relatively solid environment (motel on the southwest of the road) and extensive, interesting dialogues. The woman "May" is haunted by the man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). He tries to hide from him at the motel, but finds her. The film explores the history of their relationship, especially from childhood, which led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for characters and understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is the result of past events beyond their control. We watch them mainly fight, create, fight, create and so on. One image that stands out in my mind is Eddie, who moves on his shoulder kicking and screaming, taking her somewhere he doesn't want to go. The soundtrack is also the perfect soulful country with the lesser-known "Sandy Rogers" vocals. She has this country voice doll that almost yodels in some places in the album! That's the kind of movie that stays in some part of your brain / soul. In other words, go look!
