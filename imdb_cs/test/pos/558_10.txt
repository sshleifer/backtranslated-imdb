MUST SEE documentary .- This movie had so many things to watch when watching. It was a great documentary about a 15-year-old black man named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police issued a statement from a dead woman's husband about the description of the man who killed his wife. My husband wanted to change some things to connect with what the police said the young man wears. The police are investigating little crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is thorough in getting information to help his client. He tells the audience what he thinks and the strategy he will use for the police to show his incomplete investigation and beat against his young client to make him confess. The camera goes with McGuinness, where Brenton was questioned. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and monitors the sound. He asks the police at the booth and asks what the Brenton heard one investigator, and questions their own words. McGuinness is investigating with Ann Finnell every place the police should leave and the things they should do, but not. The film shows Servants as a loving Christian family who has faith in her son's innocence and the belief that God will appoint Brenton for free. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton, lawyers, judges and all involved in this case. I am white and I was surprised how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. It was very disappointing to see the black-and-white police stick together when they think they have a man. Police have hard work and I believe that most of them are honest, not like those in this movie. I think it's a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system, including judges, police and lawyers, and even potential jurors who can view and learn from the film.
