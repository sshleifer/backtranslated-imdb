Wow! I must say this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of ​​the show is very original and very reassuring! It's also a pleasure to watch the performance of two beautiful front ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are just awesome! I'm especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! it's not just a pretty face, it's also a "monster" actress! I'm not saying Alexis is also not a great actress ... I just like Lauren better! yet it's really a pleasure to see them on the screen, "saving" with words! in the words of immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
