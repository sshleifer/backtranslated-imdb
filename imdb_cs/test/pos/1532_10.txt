I really love this movie. He has a very real feeling about it. I believe it has never been popular because of the subject, however, because the topic makes the film all the more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I recommend it very. If you like the "1984" book or movie, I think you will enjoy this one as well. It is cruel, at least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some quite ugly. Not for a week in the heart or in the stomach. No gore, but his film is so great at showing mental expectations that he doesn't need blood and intestines. <br /> <br /> If you're not a realist or a pestimist, I don't think you will like it. It leaves you uncomfortable about people, what they are capable of, and the very real possibility that our government (s) may not necessarily have our personal best interest in her heart.
