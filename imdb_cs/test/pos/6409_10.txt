This movie is like dirge. When he gets to the musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but more subtle, like caressing the mind. MIND FOREPLAY. The depressing atmosphere given by the speed and despair of characters can be quite Kill-Yourself-Awesome UNTIL until you get to the music numbers. It's a great movie. Optimistic. Strange. Manic depressive (bipolar). And it is done! THIS FILM IS BIPOLAR. see. It's MUSIC !!! S DEPTH !!!! If you like an existential wreck like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, then you'll probably get a real kick. I had to get a DVD over Amazon.com for $ 12. OH & Rock Songs. Well they rock, but they're not rock, there like calypso, jazz, broadway, but Grace Chung, & I can't find the NOWHERE <soundtrack, but I want the songs to be great, and dances are so fun.
