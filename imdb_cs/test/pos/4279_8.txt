Fellow's marriage drama of a couple who is threatened by a younger third party interested in a house wife (Watson). Wilkinson plays a role very well as a troubled husband who is unable to control the cheating of his wife and deals with this problem. I also like Rupert Everett in his role as William Bule, a man with whom he has a Watson affair. Though I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a little problem with how her character was written, she didn't make her too likable (I know the cheater isn't supposed to be nice, but some of her actions and things have no reason behind them) ). The scenario was perhaps a weak part of this drama, although the Fellowes direction was good and the performances were also pretty good. This film is better than an unfaithful but not a masterpiece in any way. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, My Rating: 8/10
