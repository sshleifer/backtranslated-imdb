You know, this movie reminded me of so many people I know, I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I was just on the floor and laughing because it had such a serious and documentary feeling, but the dialogue is so cheerful that you can't help but have fun. The film is basically about these crazy dog ​​owners who compete in the big dog show to find out who is the best of the best. It seems to be dogs that take this competition seriously, it turns out that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, is almost a serial psycho killer to a hotel manager because he can't find a special beekeeping toy for his dog. There's another pair that's great, Gerry and Cookie, this complete nerd and an attractive woman that's just so nice. At the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many Cookie lovers he had. During the film, her "lovers" will see her and hit her in front of Gerry! It was great and fun to watch Gerry's look. This whole film is just hooves and you can't stop with recognizable faces that still appear. It's a great movie is just fun to watch, I would highly recommend! Now I have to find a nice way to show it to my friends who are like these couples to see a mirror image of themselves. : D <br /> 8/10
