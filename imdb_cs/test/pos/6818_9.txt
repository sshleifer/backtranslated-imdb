This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR), they also love it. The dialogue is so "real". Acting is excellent. While the effects / props themselves were not so convincing, taken with everything else in the shot, they are professionally placed / used. Music is so scary, ideal for this kind of "moment" movie. People who hold their beliefs and thoughts are shaken by their core about what they see in this film. Most go 'that's it?', But at the end they bloom with new understanding, and leave the film with one word to describe it: <br /> <br /> 'Beautiful'. The beauty of the film is also deep. I love the fact that there are no contradictory opinions, no other voices and voices that you hear are not the same. no conflict, but one. And the end made me love more! Rough reality sometimes is more film worthy than any device plot or twist. (Wasn't Joshua Leonard the guy in the Blair Witch project?) :) A movie from a fictitious dead guy .. great!
