The film begins with a housewife gang (Norma Shearer) who found out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) cheated on her. Three years have passed and apparently divorced in those years because of infidelity. In particular, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children as Shearer took them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a wealthy lady company and she invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend - allegedly to help Mary break the budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Norma is now super-vampa, and with her magical sexual attraction she can break the romance - and no one realizes that she and La Rocque are married. Several more are here for the weekend and now Norma is a hit with her homosexual, carefree sexy ways - and almost all men (including La Rocque) catch her. She doesn't even tell anyone that they're married, but it is clear that her ex-new and improved Norma is back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of ways between the top crusts - just like in some respects, Jean Renoir is the RULES OF GAME. Oddly enough, despite the severity of depression, such pretty rich people's movies were quite popular, though many nowadays will find them a little too droll in places. Fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are plenty of cute and funny moments (especially when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although it's not a great movie, it's definitely good and more than just a different time. The only real regret is that I didn't love the end. You'll only have to see it for yourself - maybe you'll agree with the end, maybe you won't, but I'm sure you will like this smart movie.
