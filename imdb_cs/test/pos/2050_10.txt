This is the movie is actually one of my favorite times. I'm not a Renny Harlin fan because most of his films suck, but the TLKG will hit its brand from time to time. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who is suffering from amnesia. she is married to a child and as she qoutes "I'm a damned member of PTA." And then her world disintegrates as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity. Samuel Jackson plays a con artist cop who makes PI concerts, he is dragged along to solve her identity and get paid some money for his work. along what we find, Samantha is really Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy who was left dead for years. The storyline is great, so this story seems real and Jackson does a great job as a second violin to Davis (who always does great acting). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with an unforgettable scene after an unforgettable scene. pretty impressive visually when the baby got nervous at the end (watch out for cars!) I'm tired of the little kids screwing the movie to be rescued, but still, this movie is worth the baby's addition to the movie. Again, this movie is really good, I never understood why it didn't do more at the box office, but if it was the man who played the movie, I'm sure it would be a hundred million. What is good is that over the years more people have been discovering this film and giving it good grades because the average of this movie on this site has grown over the years. I hope it goes further because it is one great action movie. and I love action movies
