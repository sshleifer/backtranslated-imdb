Perhaps one of the first slasher movies that came out after Halloween (Though made by Irwin Yabalans from Halloween), I must say that I sincerely found the "Tourist Trap" to be scarier and funner. The "Tourist Trap" is one of those remarkable pleasures you will find every time, and is left with the most pleasant feeling of surprise. It was the fate I told you, but one night I was at the local blockbuster (one or two months before he left the store) and I had nothing to do. Then I came across this movie, I think huh looks like a ridiculous B-movie, I rent it and took it home, the boy I was afraid. The "Tourist Trap" comes as a bad movie, it's definitely clever moments, but you have to have a lot of fun with it to really care about it. Things that impressed me absolutely the most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest of them I saw, is the number one setting. Horror without a good setup isn't much fun, not here. I love love love for the place, I feel like we can relate to it, we almost feel like we were there before. Which makes it creepier. Others are characters from whom they are extremely stereotypical and all have a real personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics, or sex-obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. Plus, they look pretty realistic and then it's Chuck Connors. Who gives great performance as Mr. Slausen, which we all all enjoy very quickly, because he is so real that he feels like the handsome man we adore. The last, and probably the most important thing that makes this movie scary is how we (the audience) jump in half of our places and turn on the rights for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies we mainly jump because of sudden changes in the music pitch, but get ready in the "Tourist Trap", that's not the case. With its perfect use of lighting, mannequins and weirdness, you feel utterly frightened. Plus, I love it, because although they may go a little over-the-top with some things, you still feel that it might happen. What is exactly what a horror movie that has such a ridiculous assumption should do, and that is to make us (the audience) feel dangerous and frightened. Overall, I don't have any serious problems, just that it's weird sometimes weird. Eventually, however, the "Tourist Trap" holds a place close to my heart for being one of the few horror films to light up and not feel safe to travel.
