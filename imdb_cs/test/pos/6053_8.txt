I served as a Corpsman on Parris Island in the late 1960s, just over 10 years after "The D. I." was shot. I was in some barracks where they shot some of the indoor scenes. I knew a lot of instructors and many recruits. I think the movie is as close as any movie that shows the life of recruitment and instructor. I think it's the best thing Jack Webb has ever done. If you were in the army, you must see this movie. So it was. This shows how important it is to take a lot of raw recruits and turn them into a man ready to defend our country. One feature I have found fascinating is that most characters are played by real Marines, not actors.
