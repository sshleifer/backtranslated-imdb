Fence: Ed and Alice are dealing. They live together and live a dark life. He slept around before meeting Alice. He has much less experience. He decides to have to sleep before he marries. He reluctantly agrees that they should see the others for a while. <br /> <br /> It really is not at first. His wild days are behind him and he's just happy. Within a day Alice would come back and tell him she'd gone out with a random guy; who, of course, begins to fall. Of course it's a BAD idea that causes extreme stress on the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the train wreck coming, but still good. <br /> <br /> It's worth renting.
