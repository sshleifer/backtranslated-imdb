Essentially steadfastly chintzy and moronic $ 1.50 version of the fifty early early evening creature's favorite feature "Boogens", this amusingly schlocky cheap center focuses on the ugly, squirmy, twisting monster that makes instant food of unhappy souls crazy enough to go around notoriously out of bounds Gold Spike Mine. Your Standard Problem with a Varied Assortment of Intrepid Bone Heads - Hectoring Hard to Deploy Mine, Cute, But Crazy Blond Kid, Wild Lady Geologist, Drinking, Inexplicably Aussie-Accented (!) Seasoned Old Mine, Charmless Doofus, Hunky, Cheerful Guy, and, Probably the most unpleasant character of a uniformly irritating bunch, a nerdy bespectacled aspiring dweeb writer who is prone to speaking in flowery, melodramatic talks - a trek into a dark, uninteresting cave in search of gold. Naturally, these intensely intolerable imbeciles find that the supposedly abandoned mine is home to a deadly, ugly, multiple beast that, in revered fashionable B-flick mode, progresses group by group. Direction, co-written, co-produced and co-edited with dumbfounding maladroitness Melanie Anne Phillips, acted with horrified equality by rank of no-cast name, further spoiled by letargic stimulation, drastically meandering narrative, murky, under-lit, \ t , concussion, redundantly pounding pseudo-John Carpenter synthesizer score, and cruddy, actress-jerky stop motion animation wormoid thing that is only quickly spotted at the very end of the movie, this very clumsy, amateur and therefore quite delectly scary by-be scarefest commits all the necessary bad film mistakes to qualify as a true four star stinkeroonie.
