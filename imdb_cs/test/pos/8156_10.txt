This is a versatile excellent movie. A moving experience full of real life emotions. We need to learn about love, sex, work, religion and American culture, regardless of their sexual preferences. Although this film is also the horrible victim of Mormon's faith (the Church of Latter-day Saints), conservative faith could easily take its place. However, it is somewhat ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by Mormons in precarious conditions. Here is the belief that has commanded generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government to join Utah. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes depicted in an unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly short. There is nothing to offend anyone with an open mind. What this film does is so obvious that homosexuality is absolutely natural for people who are gays because heterosexuality is for people who are equal! While love and sex are obviously completely different needs, it's absolutely beautiful, out of words when they both occur simultaneously between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of the most valuable gifts of life! Congratulations to the creators for a job well done!
