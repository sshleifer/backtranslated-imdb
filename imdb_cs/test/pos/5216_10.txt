I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife, who pretends to be a fairy tale! Above all, I thought the movie was great, definitely not a boring storyline! It's sad to say, but I think a lot of men can feel like this. I think he should divorce and ask him to be relocated to the extreme he went to, but he felt there was no other way out, so he falsified death. I thought it was nice that Cole's real wife played a woman she wasn't happy with in the movie. I think what this guy did was extreme, but the movie was great! Definitely recommended!
