Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and once again proves that you can create a great movie on a low budget, such as American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on a white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic filmmaking because it is the biggest and greatest film in Iceland. The music in the film, played by Sigurr√≥s, is very symbolic for the film. it is absolutely brilliant. I recommend to all who think they go and see this movie as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed. I bet this movie will win the best foreign film award next year? Worldwide!
