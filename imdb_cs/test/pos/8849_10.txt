Brilliant horror. It's totally awful and very scary. The thing is a remake by John Carpenter, but please don't get out of this movie. It's just brilliant. The beginning of the film has an extraterrestrial spacecraft that flies toward Earth centuries before humanity went through a blasted planet that emits the title of the film in a brilliant shining white and blue with the word "THING." One of the best horror movie titles ever. The cast of actors playing a 12-member science team is delighted to see their Antarctic station. on the wide screen DVD. It had to be great at the cinema. I'm sorry I didn't see it on the big screen. All the actors in this are really good and create amazing scenes of paranoia and suspense when it comes to who infected the thing. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be when Macready tests everyone who is still alive, tense, frightening and ultimately spectacular. I love it because of its funny as well. Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing makeup effects and shape changing alien designs himself. If he didn't get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, then he should be well. This is also debatable as to whether it is John Carpenter's greatest movie ... his definitely terrible masterpiece. Wait for a cold winter night. Get Budweiser from the fridge. Sit back and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame-throwing heroes fighting against the changing gore and slime towers. <br /> <br /> Totally brilliant. Ten of Ten.
