If it were possible to award 10+ .... that would be one movie I would choose. I remember that I captured this movie on television a lot, many years ago - and fortunately I was ready for it, video. Now my video copy is getting older, video technology is out of date and I'm starting to worry that I won't be able to enjoy the delicacies of this movie much longer. As a wild movie, it's beautiful. As a film about the relationship between man and nature, it overcomes anything that has been or has been projected before. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If such a thing as a lobby / pressure group exists to enforce the re-release of this movie, pay me and send me the pronto details. My guess is that she has a mint to be made by anyone who can reissue it in today's market.
