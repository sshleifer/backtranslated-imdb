I would rate this film high on my Ingrid Bergman movie list. Ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is evident in the scene after the scene. She was sad, average, funny, snobbish, flirtatious, kindly amusing, loving, tender, sad, desperate, happy, etc. -And so <br /> <br /> compelling. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls to Texas, Gary Cooper (Clint). Above all, I loved the scene where they sit at the dinner table and say nothing, they just stare at each other. She, in an elegant white dress and he in a handsome white cowboy <br /> <br /> outfit, sits there and looked at her piously. What chemistry! What love!
