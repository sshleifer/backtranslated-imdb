A truly excellent view of the world and the reality of a heroin addict. The film is one that hits too close to home to those involved in drug culture and has knowledge of what is or is not heroin dependent. A good movie that will never be really outdated. The outstanding performance of all participants and the minimalist set is Preminger's way to show how the world of JUNKIE can become. It's worth a look - education kind. The Golden Hand is a concerned look at the truth of the underground life of the pain in which the drug addict lives.
