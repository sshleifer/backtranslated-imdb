The Stoogs are back and fun than ever. "Brideless Groom" in my opinion was probably the best flick flemp. Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $ 500,000 (which was about more than a million dollars from today) from his dead uncle. BUT! There's a catch. He must marry someone that day within 6 hours. Shemp is a young man who doesn't have too many admirers, with the exception of one highly aggressive aggressive singing student. But she doesn't want her, she wants someone a little bit more about the Victoria's Secret model. But apparently he has no choice because he is not Collin Ferrel himself. But when it is printed in the newspaper that he should inherit all the money when he got married, his ex girlfriends are on the attack "I want my man back"! <br /> <br /> What's a great flash! This is there with the winners of all stooge flicks! 9/10
