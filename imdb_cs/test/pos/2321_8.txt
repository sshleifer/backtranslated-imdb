Down Periscope is not a "great movie". But then there are very few. So if your search for entertainment instead of great wisdom is a "big movie" without big cities. No sharp sexism or graphic violence will spoil this light comedy of a lot of misfits assigned to an antique submarine. They are set up so that they do not perform their tasks so that the general can get his extra star. He must marry the entire US Navy with nuclear submarines. But they are losers, and that's comedy, so you can estimate the result. But you're the cat for those underdogs, and that makes it a very funny movie. Watch and Enjoy ******** (The 8 Stars That Are)
