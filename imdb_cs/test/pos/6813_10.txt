What a show! Lorenzo Lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit by being a good cop. Then again he shows how sensitive a cop can be, displaying a variety of emotions, like no other actor, except, perhaps alone in terminal justice. <br /> <br /> GREAT ADVANTAGE!
