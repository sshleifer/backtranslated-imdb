Pink Flamingos is a film that cannot explain any word. It was as good as I thought. Expands movies. Starting with the "multiple" start and ending with a shocking but clever end, Pink Flamingos is one of the best films of the year. Don't miss this opportunity to see a great movie. Rent it on video or see it at the end of midnight. But you see it.
