TROMEO & JULIET - 10th Annual Edition <br /> <br /> The play by William Shakespeare Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in movies. Sometimes literally follows the original text (which is sometimes vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations, when directors decided to show their own view of the work. Some are good, many are average. Lloyd Kaufman's film surely stands out as one of the most original, state-of-the-art versions of bard's creation, can be placed in modern New York's crumbling and full of modern anti-social behavior, piercing, breakage and eccentric. Sex (which for more than casual readers, Shakespeare himself didn't move away), but at the same time it remains incredibly close to the overall feeling and point of what the game is all about, which is quite an effort. Kaufman wrote a screenplay with his director on the film James Gunn, which is now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo movies, making it impossible to make a perfect remake of the already perfect movie with his Dawn of the Dead script and directing one of the best horror films of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmans 'innovative directorial vision, along with James Gunns' original and unlimited writing, makes for the interpretation of Shakespeare's play, which perhaps not all "instantly" get, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and very important view of classic play. The screenplay, which is written exclusively in the iambic subway, Lemmy Motorhead's performance and the outrageous energetic soundtrack following Tromeo & Juliet is something nobody will ever forget. In addition to its historical significance, Tromeo & Julie is a treasure trove for all kinds of movie lovers. Not only for James Gunn's screenplay, he now has a good influence on Hollywood while working from within, but also because he is part of an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Well known to anyone who knows movies with lower budgets. The 10th anniversary of the DVD adds to the fact that it has included so many undiscovered gems that not only the information that one could wish for the film itself and the experience of its creation is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the DVD, but also very honest The (and disturbing) view is put into the way the independent cinema must survive these days. In many ways, the extra on the disk is an invaluable addition to the already impressive volume at Kaufman's "Make Your Own Damn Movie". In addition, historical items from the Troma vault include James Gunn, Debbie Rochon, and all the other contributors to this masterpiece, and the film itself is accompanied by at least four audio commentaries, each and every one of them, besides looking better than ever. each. informative, unbearably funny and all done for a serious addition to the movie instead of the tedious and pointless comments that are so common these days. There are new comments (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also one James Gunn did for the original DVD release, but could not be included there for some of the honesty he displays about some other people being present on this disc. With fans-props from several scenes from the movie, the video diary Lloyd Kaufman's visit to the James Gunn's Slither suite and a visit to two joined the Eli Roth Birthday Party party and much more, this is the ultimate set everyone has to own. The weather is a film historian, someone interested in interpreting Bard's great work, a big cinema fan, an independent cinema fighter, a James Gunn fan who is interested in more on low budget movies, Lloyd Kaufman fans or anything: this is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
