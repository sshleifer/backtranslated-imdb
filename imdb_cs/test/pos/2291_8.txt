I liked this movie, not because it was Tom Selleck, but because it was a good story about baseball and also had a semi-dramatic look at some of the problems that BASEBALL has come to the end of its time in Major League Sports must face. I also enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and minor facts about how games play differently. Overall, it's a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent it on a cold winter night and watch out for "Dog Day" years and know that spring training is just a few months. A good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good "DATE" movie? Trust me! *Blink*
