I watch this movie at the beginning of every summer and never stop having fun. Here the jokes are packed near each row of dialogue, giving you a bigger bang than the average Simpsons episode. Some jokes fall to the ground, or just cause a slight laugh, but others let you roll and then there are those who stick to your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." The video knows it's a video and makes no prejudices about it being different. It's easy to sit down and let the bombing of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and comedy with a tongue-in-cheek ensures there's something for everyone. When I first saw this video, I was in my sixth year and I have to admit that it still seems to me to be happy when I started working at college. This is a good movie to watch in the summer, much in the way you can watch "It's a wonderful life" for Christmas or "The Ten Commandments" for Easter / Passover. It's just funny.
