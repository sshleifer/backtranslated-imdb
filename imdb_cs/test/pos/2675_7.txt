I want to inform you that this movie was actually pretty good !!! The idea that it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wearing quite scary. This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out the scene of course to make all the horror buff like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also quite good at the IMO. Although it is not a high budget movie, the effects have sometimes become scary. It is worth watching if u like a kick ass horror is definitely !! - Tom
