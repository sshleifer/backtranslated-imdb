Today I watched the movie and found it to be great. It has no special effects to blow you into the head, and it's not violent or bloody, no terrorist or extraterrestrial beings, but it's brilliant. It's just nice, sweet, and it has brought me a totally different time, a much easier time when people could take the time on the street and look at the ocean. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it. Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the film. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but I believe everyone should watch it, usually when they feel down, or when they want to share something pleasant with their friends.
