This is one of the best TV movies I've ever seen! The title is so obvious and predictable, but they come, all TV movies are like this! The story is fantastic. It may seem ridiculous, but it is based on an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave, who feels trapped in marriage. He leaves his wife and children and then falls to death! He could be with Alyson (Karen Sillas). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? Acting is a top shot for TV movies. In particular, Gary Cole holds the film together as a charming, smoothly speaking sociopath who has the answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious. Karen Sillas does the best she can as a woman who discovers her husband is LIAR and doesn't know what to do with it. Teddi Siddall, who is believed to be Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays a role well, especially when she calls her husband's "death". Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch to Sister Alyson. Linda Goranson is great in her little role as Dave's mother. Predictable but acting and storyline made this movie up a few notches.
