The trailer goes nowhere and just scratches the surface of the film, even because it has no obligation to keep its true story behind the wraps, but because what is actually happening will evoke completely different interrogation lines, some of which are not frustrating in the movie, so you can let your own devices interpret a series of events. Which of course means a lot of material for subsequent discussion. Metaphorically, the box refers to how people usually subconsciously divide into situations or things in our daily lives, and how our closed thoughts tend to see things from a certain perspective, rarely outside the box. It is a speech coming to the end of one of the characters who will let you think about this fact, which controls the basis of the whole film, and even the threading of existentialism, where our bodies are mere vessels for the soul and from the cradle to the grave that we put into more boxes the way of life. What I don't like is how he tried to sound intelligent through frequent abandonment of secret government agencies like the CIA and the NSA, as if there was something clearly secret about these agencies that we should have be aware. They serve only a small purpose, except that no action and everyone under control can be trusted by losing confusion in the sense that both characters and viewers are trying to keep up with questions of trust to help interpret the story. In 1976, they backed up NASA's background of space manned missions and in Langley, Virginia, provided that there was an increased sense of alertness that would suffer from the power of energy when you sit patiently. Based on the short story Button, Button written by Richard Matheson and created in the episode Twilight Zone, the story follows Lewis' family, where husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic leg for his teacher Norma (Cameron Diaz)), and you think it's all a happy family with their son Walter (Sam Oz Stone) until one day a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella, pair-to-face inspired) starts to be The demonstration process preceded, coming knocking and giving them a Deal or No Deal button in the box. Immerse the button and they'll get a million dollars (here we are talking in the 70s dollars), even if the alien dies there. If not, the agreement has an expiration date. The story would dictate an agreement that would, of course, provoke a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more constrained characters (who are bleeding from the nose), some who are inexplicably zombies, obviously all under the influence, or employment, or Arlington Steward. Whether Steward Death is, or not, a secret civil servant, a messenger from God, or a representative of aliens after the anal probe, remains unanswered, so whatever you look at, it is as if it is bringing something expected. to get rid of his innate greed so his work can be shortened and returned to where it comes from. <br /> <br /> If you need a little distraction from the rambling scenes that make up the story, the production sets and the art direction are wonderful in the restoration of the 70s as you try to figure out the mystery of the consequences that result from the result of not fully understanding the fine print . This exploration of human nature, our greed for instant gratification, manifested by its consequence in the long-term pain, confusion and other choices we make based on real sacrifices. Special special effects also enter the game, although it simply leaves more space in the genre of the film. So is it a horror, a sci-fi, or a mysterious thriller? It is all that is actually in one, along with the sprinkling of philosophical. Do not expect a straight narrative film with clear and easy answers to appear at the end? this is like the X-Files episode on steroids.
