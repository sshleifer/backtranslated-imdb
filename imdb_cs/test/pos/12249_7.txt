In fact, I haven't seen a lot of movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a nice surprise. She is a stubborn journalist Jane Craig, who devotes all her time to television news. Her colleague Aaron Altman carried a long torch without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is a slightly reserved former sportsman who is a new reporter. For Jane, it symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news - turning her into edutainment, not a serious business. Much to her surprise, Jane finds herself attracting Tom. Holly Hunter is doing a great job as an energetic journalist. But I don't know what he'll find out about his new colleague, Tom. It's something that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost equally impressive is Albert Brooks, who puts everything in the role of a professional who gives over 100 percent for his work, but he doesn't get it in return. Actually, I thought for a moment that he was Steve Guttenberg of the Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines, and if it were Meg Ryan, they would call it a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Within two hours, several scenes can be edited or completely omitted, such as Jane and Aaron's Journey to Central America. I am also a fool for happy ends, and seven years ago, I preferred another ending than just meeting them three.
