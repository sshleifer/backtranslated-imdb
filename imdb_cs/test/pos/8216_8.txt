This movie was exciting and fun. Since I am a fan of these films, I enjoyed it. The assumption is a bit scary, but the fact that I didn't rate it 10 was that the movie was a bit over the top in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NOBODY could identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolation, but it is hard for me to believe that SOMEBODY-ANYBODY could not identify this girl as Angela Bennet. That was upstairs, so there was a scene where she went to someone's desk and started writing. It was overall a good movie, exciting and keeps your interest. Dennis Miller was great because Allen, really believable, Bullock was good because a lonely reserved computer worker, all the militants, underestimated. I think the PREMISE movie was really different and scary. Nowadays, who knows what could happen? But some of the best scenes prevented this movie from being 10. 8 out of 10.
