Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood in the West, fighting with military bureaucracy, companions, Indians and carpet traders who are the only hand to his great and ultimate heroic end. Don't forget the ever more reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary in the West. Never try to link this story to reality and real people, it doesn't work. Enjoy it because no one has ever claimed to be documenting when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn collaborated.
