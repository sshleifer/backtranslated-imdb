The classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World" remake. 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antarctica. They are attacked by things from the universe - it absorbs and duplicates everything it chooses. It starts as a dog, but relaxes - and has a chance to copy any of the men. Soon no one else trusts anyone - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - much like their helicopter. What will they do? The movie was scary. This one is too - but the story is different (and more embedded in the source material - the novel "Who goes there?") And it's terrifying in another way. The film begins with the extremely scary Ennio Morricone score, which is just the right tone and - when Thing is attacked - the amount of gore is overwhelming. There's blood and body parts flying everywhere - arms bitten, heads torn off and - in the strongest - one person is first swallowed face to face. Gore effects are a powerful and real nightmare material. I am not afraid easily, but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw it originally in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are simply incredible - how did this image get to R after me! It also has a very fearsome feeling - gore aside, it's very exciting. Not sure who is what's and Carpenter's direction and score really build tension. One complaint - no one has any characteristic personality traits. Actors remain equal and say their lines. This is annoying ... but the movie still works. In 1982, it was a critical and commercial disaster - competing with "E.T." and many critics have complained about the amount of gore and there are no female characters in the film. It is now considered the best of John Carpenter. I have to see ... for strong stomachs. NOT A Date Movie! A funny note: When it was released Universal sent a note along with all the prints of the movie. They suggested to the theater owners to play a movie in the hall near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so violent that they would have to be close to the equipment they would throw!
