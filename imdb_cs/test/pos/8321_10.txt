and frankly, it's just a summary. It is a small computer animated series that is filming just like animal documentation .... <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (I thought long-necked dinosaur swimming eyes looked fake ). However some of the model shots didn't look quite realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought Jurrassic Park did a better T Rex .. <br /> <br /> If it's the type of thing we see on a regular British TV series, I can't wait to see what they can do in the movies. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 stars ... <br /> <br /> (and "making" the video was also great ..... the dinosaur on the skate board was awful) <br /> <br /> <..>
