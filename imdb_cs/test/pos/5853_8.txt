It's hard for me to believe that it could ever happen. We don't know if Justin and Richard were in the past concerned or committed crimes. The film seems to indicate that they have not gotten in and out of trouble. So the first crime they committed is murder? Just play and push the cops? How do they pick up a girl and say you are? Richard seems to be strangling a woman with little or no effort, and women seem to fight. Hmmm. It's hard to believe this whole concept. That said, let's move on. I found myself really hating these punks and would like to be present with my firearm with police tactical ammunition and find out what their plastic suits then. As for Cassie, who was the victim of Carl Hudson, she has a terrible time to survive. Remembering that Carl had stabbed him twice, he left her in an emotional mess. Sandra does great acting. She must have convinced me that he was one angry cop. As for the solution to the crime, I thought it was great. This movie left me in a chair. He loved acting except Sam. He didn't get up and go. One thing this movie didn't need was a love scene, or I should say a rape scene.
