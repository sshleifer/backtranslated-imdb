Eric Bogosian's ability to turn from character to character in this 'one man show' shows his true range as a character actor. Every person has their own message to tell the truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! His performance includes some of the most entertaining and real moments I've ever seen as a spectator.
