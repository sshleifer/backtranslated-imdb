Someone on these advice predicted that the whole thing was about the best friend of the protagonist, even though his friend hadn't seen him for about 20 years. I reluctantly reject it, but it raises some viable questions. Why should a telephone technician - or shoe or butcher care about it - want to create a mythical world and mistake it around a friend who fills him in the process, with a number of equally mythical support characters. With the idea that a good friend should be WRITING not dreaming. Dreams or not. Someone, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very attentive world in which Tony Servillo makes the fine art silence. We are asked to believe that forty something that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) "upset" the mafia several years before our encounter with him and as repentance is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel from where he goes to a local bank with a nine-week suitcase every week ml large in used notes. Aside from this weekly trip, what he likes is free, and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds her husband how far they have fallen socially and ignore the friendly demonstration of Olivia Magnani he has spent two years and tried to get him a smile and / or a "good evening". For reasons that are best known to him, and contrary to a man who has no or no interest, Servillo spends every day taking a stethoscope on his bedroom wall and listening to his private conversations. partners. Finally, he answers Magnani - he has to do it or it wouldn't be a movie. This is a 6f conspiracy: the one about Destry who never wears a weapon, or Sean (Duke Wayne), a 'Silent Man' who refuses to enter provocation and fight to a mandatory scene where the weapon is strapped and fists lean - but instead to settle for a polite acceptance of stai oggi, remove 100,000 from her briefcase and buy her a car. The last mismatch comes when Magnani tells him to take him the next day at 16:00 in her car and leaves for the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We found out that he was living on the spot, so why the ride from somewhere far away is being ignored, ignoring the police roadblocks to leave the road and tipping the car. These discrepancies are the difference in the fact that it is a great film production with excellent performance and very good support.
