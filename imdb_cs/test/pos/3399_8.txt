Dramatic drama with big sets, costumes and performances ??? although some people point to Rhetta, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men are trying to keep friendship despite family ties and location. Beautiful villains? you will want everyone to reach a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this? good and bad. Secondary storylines are also well developed. Several portraits of the great stars of the past. Good representation of history and conflict for those who find themselves between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Raise on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink with this. The bike and carpet would be optional.
