Spanish director Luis Buñuel has overcome his career for almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. His best films were those he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in the industry, who was mainly interested in making commercial movies imperfect on the audience, yet somehow he managed to create interesting movies that provoked ideas. This film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos, a Spanish author - and the adaptation is fairly faithful, although this place in Mexico in the early 20th century instead of Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as the one prescribed by Christ. The question that many would ask is whether such an effort would be possible without your hostility, misunderstanding and mockery. As it happens, he suffers from a lot of indignation, yet he remains stubborn (until the controversial final) of this goal. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarina as a somewhat ridiculous character, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) would come out admirable. In any case, a great movie.
