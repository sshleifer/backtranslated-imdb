I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Director Neal Slavin's impressive performance includes William Macy (seen in Contender at last year's TIFF), Meat Loaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring in Novocaine, also this year). Festival). Based on Arthur Miller's novel of the same name, Focus follows the Christian, but the "Jewish gaze" of Lawrence Newman (Macy), when fighting between hatred and anti-Semitism in its neighborhood. Newman faces difficulties in resolving internal conflicts and conflicts around him when he is built between a Jewish street trader (Paymer) and his anti-Semitic neighbor (Meat Loaf). Guilt over knowing what is right, but doing nothing to fight to want to merge and maintain peace with neighbors. Things become more complex when they meet Gertrude (Dern) who thinks she is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about examining books by packaging. Will Newman Hold a Jewish Man at the End or Run? Go see it find out. Acting was wonderful. Writing was incredible. The film was excellent. The sound was good. Technically amazing, the film was disturbing. Cooling. Emotionally intense. I found out that I had taken my knees several times into a fetal position. I have great admiration for everyone who worked on it. I haven't seen this movie for a long time. It touched me. Wow.
