Essentially, this film contains all the elements of the great 70s of the film, except that it was a direct video market in the late 1980s. You have a young couple in love, but the whole world is either crack or gang violence. When a friend goes to jail, a girlfriend ends up being vulnerable to all the criminals who are all in this movie, except cops. First he gets hooked on a crack dealer and then, because he owes money to Lord Jim Brown money, she becomes the property of Brown. Then it is essentially enslaved in a military style crack house that is named for the movie. As if it wasn't enough to see this movie, you also have Anthony Geary playing a seemingly conservative adviser, but he's a serious dealer. In a slim but cheerful scene, she asks sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money to fix. She was found to be her mentor in an earlier scene. The scene and the next scene where Jim Brown forces her to take a hot shower because it stinks is hysterical. Leading actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. Not surprisingly, someone who mentioned in another review that Tarantino is the main fan of this. It's just the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance, and yes, a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's thief turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80-year-old B villain, Wings Hauser at Vice Squad. Sometimes I think the film B should be Oscars where it would be possible to present such a performance. Meanwhile, hopefully modern filmmakers will learn to use the same type of language in cheek humor.
