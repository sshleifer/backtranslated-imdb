For an independent film, it does well with reasonably high production values ​​and a large cast. The deal is uneven, but the plot is convincing. We could use a bit more Wes Ramsey character development, but hey, this guy is fun to look at! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like cake on the cake. No wonder it was controversial about its release. It represents a less than flattering depiction of the Morman Church and its relationship with homosexuals. Although, like Brokeback Mountain, it's about tolerance and acceptance of your own life, I found it more successful in conveying positive messages. It was also more mobile.
