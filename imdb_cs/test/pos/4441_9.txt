The documents in which sons and daughters try to understand parents and their own lives through this process are not so unusual. Also unusual are the results that reflect the lack of talent, the failure of introspection, the abundance of narcissism, and perhaps the inconspicuous pursuit of publicly projected revenge for countless wounds, real and fantasized. What is unusual is the brilliant, fair and captivating portrait of a fascinating parent and "My Architect: The Son of the Road" is a rare achievement. Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where a talented young man loved art and music. Soon he became in love with buildings and decided to answer his creative skills with an architect's career. Kahn became an architect, but as this film shows, it took a long time to draw the leaders' attention to his field. One architect suggests that he has become a victim of "yellow tape" that anti-Semitism, which, together with the bias towards women, has long been the undisputed aspect of the American architecture profession. When he reached the announcement He was seen, clearly, as a confident, workaholic prophet preaching relentless demands that his vision and vision be realized. This rigidity was the reason why while he drew wonderful plans for the many buildings he had built, but several. The conversation with the old man who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed city center, where people left their cars on the perimeter and entered the city, is cheerful. Kahn was a born teacher and some extensive archive footage shows him with students, his voice is steady but passionate, their views are respectful and intense. Many architects were approached by the director, writer and project Honcho Nathaniel Kahn, an architect. son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and still active nonagenarian, Philip Johnson. Their comments radiate a vivid image of this idealistic but ultimately financially unsuccessful building designer that has combined castles, fortresses and large buildings of the past centuries into the present. Kahn's buildings are shown, the most impressive is Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. His style has a neo-romantic air for me that is amplified by excessive empty space that repels rather than human interaction. But Kahn's son was more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a woman with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of whom produced a daughter, the other a son. Kahn often visited his son in his mother's house, but at the end of the evening, mother and son took Kahn back to the marriage house. Apparently, Nathaniel wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships, but apparently there was clearly no obvious strange problem for the little boy. When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the Pennsylvania Station in New York after returning from India, where he had one of his massive projects, another that never was. built. At that time, his Philadelphia company was at least $ 500,000 in debt, and if he had lived in a federal bankruptcy court, he was probably in the smell. Kahn left several monumental buildings, of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. The shy local architect welcomes Kahn for building a building where democracy (and hopefully will) flourish. Architect Moshe's colleague Safdie believes that in Kahn's suffering of a deadly heart attack, something could be a train station due to his constant globetrotting. I disagree: unfortunately, it is ironic that Kahn should die in an anonymous replacement for one of America's genuine architectural treasures, the old Pennsylvania Station, destroyed to create a path for sterile substitution without character and without continuing civil memory. During the journey of younger Kahn, several emotional moments, including his half-sisters and his mother, were filmed, but they are real and moving, not maudlin and staged. Architecture historians will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a faulty but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man. 9/10.
