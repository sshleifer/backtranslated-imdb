This is the third three that the team has ever done, and like many of their first, it's totally and totally hysterical! She now owns her on DVD as part of the three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I like it, I watch it! In this short movie, Moe, Larry and Curly are playing these three doctors in the hospital who are trying to help everyone but the boys, they end up making a mess of everything! This short is another of my favorite shorts, Three Stooges, and I am also a big fan of slapstick comedy, and Three Stoogs are kings of slapstick! When I heard he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Film, I was really curious about it when I heard he was lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the three funniest three blades, I suggest you see this hysterical unrest! <br /> <br /> 10/10
