Fun and almost unbearable melancholy of music Amalia Rodriques goes to a place in the soul that can only be disturbed by music. With her voice and magical presence, she lies on the beautiful Fada agony, an art form that I didn't know until I saw this film. The success of this beautiful and lovingly crafted documentary is for me The fact that the filmmaker gives up the temptation to go and simply lets us participate in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon. There seems to be inevitable corrosion between the Portuguese Fado and the American Blues. At best, documentary filmmaking takes us to an unknown reality. and when this view has been allowed, we are transformed. Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
