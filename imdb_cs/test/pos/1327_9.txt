I heard that after the first movie Oceans, the sequel continues downhill. I don't think so (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Benedict visits each of them personally to give them money back within two weeks. To do this, he has to do a couple of heists in Europe to raise money. Acting is very good. The whole star has filled expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But it doesn't matter because there are only a few confusing moments. By the way, this film is made only for harmless entertainment. Overall, this is a great film about heist film. I rate this movie 9/10.
