I'm not really sure what to do from this movie, especially after seeing a great movie like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw it in German during the Antonioni Film Festival in Frankfurt, so I didn't hear Malkovich's big voice. Italy should combine four stories about pairs. However, as good an actor as he is, Malkovich can't save the ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes to him at the coffee shop at her own stores and blinks as her close father killed her father. Then both of them return home, have sex and leave. Antonioni seems to have lost the subtlety he had in previous films (like The Passenger) when he was engaged in sex and replaced it with obvious nudity. However, the pointless story is that the film contains two things that make it observable: the eye and the ear of candy. Actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and cinematography is amazing - scenes in old Italian cities contrast with a little in a tall apartment building overlooking the city (reminiscent of La Notte). However, ear candy is what really makes a movie worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence". Songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
