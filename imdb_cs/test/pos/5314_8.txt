I loved the hunters in the rye, it's my favorite book. JD Salinger, author of the catcher, has rights to this book and has made it so that neither person can make a film with his permission. with what heres says "United States of Leland." "A beautiful movie with a great sense and depth of emotion. But much of it reminded me of hunters, almost reminiscent of hunters. A few stories Leland said in a movie like New York and his adventures were very similar to those of holden in the catcher And the way Leland's views of people and emotions is also similar to Holden's, both are simple and true to each other and the others .The superior actor credited to Don Cheadle and Kevin Spacy. At least rent a good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that pulls on some points, but it makes it in the long run.
