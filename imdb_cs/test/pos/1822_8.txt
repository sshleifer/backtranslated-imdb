This movie is one of my favorite movies and it's what made me a lifelong fan of Nicolas Cage. In the mid-1980s, I filmed this movie (when the VCR couldn't do it with !!) and watched it again and again. Nicolas Cage is just great here. And it looks wonderful and has no effect on "acting" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean!). I measure all his performances against this. He was as perfectly occupied as a great punk guy with nervous friends. Music was great. Plimsouls! Psychodelic fur! Modern English! Men at work! Whenever I hear "Melt With You", I'm taken back to the final of this movie. What happened to his cute costume, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? He certainly did a different turn than Nicolas! Interestingly, slutty's friend (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being the voice of Tommy of Rugrats (being billed as E.G. Daily for that horrible show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a great trip back to the 80s, check out this movie. It's definitely a classic. Like Totally!
