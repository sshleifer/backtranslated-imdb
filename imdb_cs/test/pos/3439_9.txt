"Jaded" takes over the complex issue of abuse: offender and victim. In smaller hands, it would break into an erotic thriller made for direct video. However, this director managed to pull out a textured multi-layered study with a distinctly different perspective. Given that the director / writer is a woman and a major detective and D.A. they are also women, which could become a very anti-human film. It's not. Being a sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. Rape is brutal, not sexual. We look at the victims and not the titration. Gifted castings are true. For a film that is so little known, I was surprised by the quality of the show. They are good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. Somehow this movie has been lost. Maybe he's too smart for his own good. It's "should see". Highly recommended. Sexual thriller thinking person.
