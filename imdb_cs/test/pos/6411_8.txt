In the middle of the Hole I sent a friend by email to sum up. I'm not sure if the movie would split into a series of submissive gestures, but I felt a little un-easy, I recommend it, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. I live in Korea for 6 months and this movie could just as easily summarize the strange ennui and frustration of any Asian metropolis as it insists on Taiwan. Using the myth of musicals Hong Kong as well as Godard or Hartley using Western musicals, but taking it to the extreme, it's a bold world and sometimes Kafka-esquire logic makes it better. I really feel that the closest comparison of The Hole is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but they have a bit of a grim edge to what is ultimately hopeful and strangely metaphorical. Anyway, it's what I wrote to Esther. I hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> you watch a movement called a hole. Taiwan, I think it's a little weird if it's not Hong Kong. it's worth seeing. it's about a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. The guy's ceiling cave in and the girl starts getting angry and well it's a little weird metaphor for present pleasure, degregation and pain somewhat intense crush. There's also a little zombie-virus-sub-plot and lots of weird little scenes where the girl acts to her wishes through innocent and a little fun 50-doo-wop sequences. worth seeing.
