In the late 1980s and early 1990s the decline and death of independent video companies like Vestron and Media effectively shut down Italian horrors for much of its American audience. Coincidentally (?) Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability. Occasionally movies like Primal Rage, "sequel" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2, and several Dario Argento movies went on video but most unreleased (until DVD) remained in the US for nearly a decade or longer. Films from these lost years have become very sought-after and have spoken of horror fans. Of these movies, Cat In The Brain is apparently one of the most noble of all due to the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directing, but also played their idol, Fulci himself. Although not Fulci's best, it's still better than most of his later efforts. His angry fan base will probably love her. Italian horror and giallo fans can also enjoy, depending on their taste, but I'm not sure about anyone else. People who only look at Hollywood things may not want them to learn about many vibrant reviews. One thing I personally fascinated was a scenario probably the only permanent contribution of Benito Mussolini to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is immediately recognizable to all Italian movie fans. Until I saw it, I could imagine what it looked like.
