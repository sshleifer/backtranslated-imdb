After seeing Harry Potter movies, I'm a fan of the trio of actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson; yet we waited to see if they would do other projects except the same year or every two years J.K. Rowling Series. Camera and magazine articles tend to focus on Daniel and Emma instead of trio, they are the leading man and the only leading female saga leaving Rupert's dead end. It doesn't matter, every actor has time to shine and Rupert's light hits him once in this movie. "The Lesson" is called Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall, a young British boy who lives with his mother (Laura Linney) and protector of the vicar (priest) father. (and failure) and writing poetry for a young girl who has no interest in him. Ben is looking for advertising in church newspapers for which this work requires care for the elderly. He takes the job and realizes he's a fun surprise like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), an actress who is also a poet giving Ben a run for his money. They get together and tell each other secrets along with Evie, who acts like a child and gets into a disaster where he drags Ben on the ground. Not only do they ride Ben all the way from Britain to Scotland, because Evie needs a lecture at the local library, but at the same time an older woman falls on a young man in which Ben becomes a man. There is an accident while rejoicing with Ben and Evie along with the fact that I was very pleased with the film when it came out in theaters and I was impressed by Rupert Grint's acting, especially when he showed the rest of the world even if he brings a bit of Ron Weasley in Ben Marshall, his actors won't stop his great performance.
