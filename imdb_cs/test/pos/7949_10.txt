I was fortunate to watch this movie at a recently concluded international film festival. In fact, I was able to watch another South Korean film (The Power of Kangwon Province), but I was more interested in Christmas in August. The story is pretty simple, the usual boy-meets-girl (or will we call a girl-meets-boy?). For me it was strange how it was released. We can say that the film was quiet and cute. We cannot have opulent and inventive romances here, just two ordinary beings who have become beautiful because of their friendship and unspoken love. I also loved how the film used pictures as expressions of past and present relationships. I wished it would be shown as a normal movie. I'm sure it would call for a bigger audience.
