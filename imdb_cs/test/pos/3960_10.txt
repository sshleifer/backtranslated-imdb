Let me explain. That's not a "good movie", but I'm so glad she's out there, I'm so glad I saw it, and it's amazing for the role it plays in my DVD collection. It's the ultimate PG-13 romp, it's college as we imagine it will be when we are freshmen in high school, it takes so much suspension of distrust that it can also be taking place on Mars. It's so healthy that even if you're trying to be dirty, it won't be your grandmother uncomfortable. Watching it takes so little sophistication, (in fact, thinking too hard about what's going on gets in the way of your appreciation of this work), it gives me the feeling that I am 12 years old again. And this kind of experience costs over $ 9.99.
