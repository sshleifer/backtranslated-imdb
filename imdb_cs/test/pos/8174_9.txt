I found that this epic is a stunning, remarkable, even heartbreaking beauty. Some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative wealth, wonderful dramatic movement and dynamism. The choreography is extremely pleasant here, the actors are absolutely pleasant. Was I a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER? also, but this was even better. They have Kitan's ingenuity in the pleasure of what is pleasing. This beauty confirming adventurous cinema is an act of courage. When was the tension so wonderful and true? And the art of showing huge crowds, gigantic armies? The film has something of a deeply satisfying and persistent good taste. Is it an immense pleasure from such a deliberately impressive and clean show? Few, little adventurous movies, let alone epics, gave me such uninterrupted joy. <br /> <br /> The fan can be monumental. It's not a monumental art, but it's a monumental pastime like Leone's films, like some of the 1960s; as well as the hobbit trilogy. It's great fun.
