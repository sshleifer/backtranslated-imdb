Tonight I was supposed to attend PRIVILEGE's British premiere of Inglorious Basterds! I saw the trailers I had great hopes but had doubts due to the string of self-indulgent movies (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name) <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I found out that he pulled out the cat from the bag. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, a perfect timed comedy with an imaginary brutal assassination. The crown of the fame of this film, however, is that Christoph Waltz, who is not found in error or mistake. He managed to create a real tension in the audience while remaining quite "theatrical" (he couldn't think of a better word). Definitely deserved a prize in Cannes and undoubtedly heading for the Oscar !!!! I hope to see him again soon!
