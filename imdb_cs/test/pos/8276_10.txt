I was - unlike most reviewers - unborn in the 1980s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Still, my life was 80's. When the other kids had a playstation, I played Zelda on my NES, etc. Now, this movie has a special place in my heart, even though I was only 15 when I was writing this review. Because of my childhood in the 1980s, I watched many TV shows and saw many of the films that other children did not see, and this film was one of them and one of the biggest. Beginning in Los Angeles, Alvin Sevilla, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the adoptive father of Chipmunk, is in a hurry to get to the airport when he goes on a business trip in Europe. His taxi is almost there and the Chipmunks help him pack. While they speak, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and see the world (Although, technically Dave only goes to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as 'the world'). David leaves Chipmunks under the care of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave is gone to the airport and the Chipmunks are left home with Miss Miller. Later, at the local Chipmunks caf√© they play '' Around the World in 30 Days '' against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game with Brittany after his hot air balloon ate crocodile from the sky, Alvin goes into conflict with Brittany about who would really win the race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overheard their argument, and when they need a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, they decide to deceive the children to deliver them. They have set up a race around the world where every team will have to throw a doll on their own form (secretly filled with diamonds) when they fall around the world and get the doll in the form of an opponent (secretly paid for diamonds) to 'change that they are' '. The winning team would then receive a $ 100,000 reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (Interpol's agent, who has been hot several times on his heels) should never suspect them because they are just children (but this seems unnecessary because they make children on their journeys. security check and never even ask for dolls, I think Klaus and Claudia wouldn't be there if they took the diamonds in person. This film is classic and I don't see why anyone wouldn't like it. It is characterized by great animation and voice, not to mention Kick-ass (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is without a bit of doubt '' Girls and Boys from Rock and Roll '' An amazing rock song that can't be finished. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include '' Getting Lucky '' (A Suggestive for Child Movie eh?) And '' My Mother '' as well as '' Wooly Bully '' and '' Off to See the World '' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with '' My Mother '' still brings tear to my eye. In the context of 'Getting Lucky', I didn't think about anything for the first time, but when I got older and learned about life, it was clear that the song was a bit suggestive. The song along with the fact that the animators insist that the audience knows the color of the Chipettes. This is especially evident in the scene in Egypt when Chipettes are chased by Arab prince men when Eleanor tilts the side of a hot air balloon and her skirt defies gravity altogether. While doing nothing of the overall quality of the film, it's one of those inexplicable things, such as why no one in the world realizes there are four meters high Chipmunks who walk around and speak incredibly high voices and treat them equally as if it were any human child. A little after that scene, the Chipettes discover diamonds in dolls and decide to find Chipmunks and get home. Director Janice Karman improves this film because she and her husband Ross Bagdasarian Jr know the characters better than anyone else. They even make Chipmun and Chipet voices. Ross made voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice made voices for All Chipettes and Theodore. Talking about male characters who are voiced by female voice women, Nancy Cartwright (voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this film. He plays the role of an Arab prince, a very small but important role. Of course, the end is happy. The Crooks were caught, the loose ends tied, and the movie ends when kids, Dave and Miss Miller go to sunset, Alvin complains that he didn't get a $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which Dave poisones until he finally screams '' ALVIN! '' And the screen fades to black <br /> <br /> By the way, the classic ending. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this movie, give it a watch, it's worth the money. This nostalgic classic from the 80s gets 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> '' Headin 'on top, don't know! we never stop believing now ''
