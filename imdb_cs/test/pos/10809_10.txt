This is one of the best films ever made about the French Revolution. Being a well-versed man in a time when I was impressed with the level of detail. Costumes are in place. Even detailed everyday things like ink wells, serving plates, etc., are perfect. As an American living in France who has access to places in the film through her membership in various historical associations, such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I cannot say how impressed I am from the visual accuracy of the film. The dialogue in which it is known is a virtual quote and has a character where it has not been recorded. I was very pleased with this film and I am disappointed that it is not yet on DVD. So a historical drama should be done. Must see ....
