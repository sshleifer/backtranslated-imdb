If your child of the 80s and did not see this film you failed to be a real child of the 80s. As you can't love the big chipmunks (don't forget the chippets), lines and songs. Years later I can sing every word to every song. The story is great and much better than movies for kids today. It's just pure fun and worth hiring, even if everyone has grown up.
