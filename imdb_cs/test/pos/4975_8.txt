This is one of my favorite westerns. What is the cast! Glenn Ford plays his part in his usual mild, controlled, but solid way. Ford plays one of the smaller farmers in the shadow of a massive anchor ranch that wants to swallow the whole territory. Edward G Robinson plays a crippled patriarch of an anchored ranch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his catchy wife. There is a lot of action in this western which is quite impressive, the scenery is excellent and the letterbox range of photography is breathtaking and the soundtrack is stereo! I'd say this western had a big budget. One of a series of great Glenn Ford westerns.
