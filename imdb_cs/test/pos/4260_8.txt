This film shows that the free enterprise system and the search for the Almighty overcome all racial and ethnic barriers. Finally, the marketplace determines the message that is sent to the public. This film dramatizes this point. A white-collar conservative advertising company is taken over by a group of street African-Americans, presided over by a non-senseless black man who wants to make money and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how hard it is to do something else, the market place and the political system require it to adapt, which is no different from its predecessors. An interesting, off-beat movie.
