Undoubtedly, the most impressive recent gay-oriented film I've seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail on his head. The way he dealt with the issue of faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of getting rid of the Christian character and Steve Sandvoss knocking his socks off as Aaron. Both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and impacts that these problems have on young homosexuals. As a homosexual who grew up in a very religious environment (though not Mormon), identification with Aaron was phenomenal for me. We strongly recommend this film to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young homosexuals have to deal with family and friends in the often hostile world. Anyway, music in this movie rocks! Another great work by C. Jaya Cox.
