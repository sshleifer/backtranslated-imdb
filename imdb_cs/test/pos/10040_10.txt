Although "they have died with their shoes on" is not quite historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character actors are excellent. In addition to the action part of Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes, they are very moving and credible (Flynn and DeHavilland really liked it in real life). Flynn was always so worried about not being taken seriously, only if he knew there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play well!
