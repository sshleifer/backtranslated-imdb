I haven't seen this movie in 30 years, so I don't know if I wanted it as much as I did when I was twelve. But at the time I loved this movie. This is a great "start-chick" for young pre-teen girls. But watch out for the end. There are tears and cruel emotions. Looking at it from a 2008 perspective (with much greater knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to watch again. Patty's staunch, insulting father, indifferent mother and favorite sister have contributed to becoming vulnerable and hungry for society. Patty was sad when Anton left. When he was killed, the hearts were broken. The anger that was directed toward her was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. The thing I have kept the most is how this movie taught me "hostile" soldiers. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol, which also pointed out that "ordinary" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. "Regular" soldiers were ready. The Gestapo was chosen among volunteers for their special hatred attitudes. I believe that one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special tasks and therefore did not go to battle. Their specialties were interrogations and torture. Later, during the Cold War, I think of Russian soldiers and I remember the SOMGS. They taught us that the Soviet Union is "evil". The fact was, however, that Russian soldiers were not destroyed in America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government is on its way to destroying their way of life. Which was, in a way, true because the US fought to end communism. This lesson is still applicable today. German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just as Muslims are not the same as al-Qaeda.
