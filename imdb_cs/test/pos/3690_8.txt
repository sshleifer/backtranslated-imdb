But great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning. I'm not entirely sure that any description of the film and the plot will lure you to see it. All I have to do is say it has something for virtually everyone: death, singing, sparkling suit, cell phones, a small person (actually a pretty-looking woman), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a crossbow. And psychotic. And Barry Manilow. You'll have to believe me when I say that 50% of you will hate this movie because of the lack of Absurd Gene in your DNA makeup. It is not your fault; it's hereditary. The remaining 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but YOU CAN KEEP WATCHING. Even at the end, you might wonder why you were looking ... for that absurdity. It should grow to you. It's a test.
