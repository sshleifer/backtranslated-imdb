This is a good movie, no doubt, but with some special aspects. Without going wrong, it takes place in just three places - a Sicilian farm, a boat, and Ellis Island in New York. All shots are close, so we never see a wide shot. I wonder if it was to save money? We will not see any street scenes anywhere, nor will we see the ship except for the close-up. And music ... what's happening on Earth with playing Nina Simone, decades before they were out? I could have done it without a milky way trade ... ... but hey, before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, it's a very good movie, with heartbreaking moments, beautiful photos, great characters and greater accuracy than usual (US) efforts in the field of immigration experience.
