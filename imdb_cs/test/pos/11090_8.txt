"Faith in the Great as an invisible power structure that exists in Reality is the most accurate definition of paranoia." ?? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Man" and "Falcon and Snowman", two films by John Schlesinger. Although Hitchcock and Lang brought a "plot thriller" to Hollywood, the genre only flourish in the late 60s and 70s, with films like "Parallax View", "Z", "Marathon Man", " Capricorn One "," Manchurian Candidate "," Three Days Condor "and" All Men of the President ".This was the age of Vietnam and Watergate, the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre remained silent in the 80s and early 90s, until the "X Files" television series surfaced to life. With taglines such as "The Truth Is Out There" and "Trust Not One", the series featured a world of huge conspiracies and government plots, a common man at the mercy of all the ways ridiculously complicated The only way out of the maze? "Fighting the Future!" as the slogan of the last season of the series said. It was our duty to drag a labyrinth of information to discover some elusive "truths" that ensured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended the boom of the Internet, conspiracy thrillers, which are now receding. documentary conspiracy ". The Internet generation has dealt with such independent documentaries as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while in the mainstream Michael Moore enchanted his audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All these documents believed in a "secret order", a case of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspired to reduce human rights and enslave the world. He is trying to create a mono-myth that combines various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all-encompassing story that explains the purpose and purpose of everything. This need to "streamline stories" to make them "more effective" is reflected in the scientific community that struggles to create the "Great Theory of Unification" and ultimately the "Theory of Everything" that connects everything from quantum mechanics to special relativity into one giant of everything involving the formula. Ultimately, the "plot thriller" is rooted in human desire to have control. The modern theme is one who manifests direct cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of a plot (the invisible Other String Pulling). This seemingly contradictory connection of cynicism and faith is strictly linked to the extinction of the Great Other. His disappearance causes us to build others out of others (conspiracy) to escape the unbearable freedom caused by its loss. Conversely, there is no need to take the Big Other seriously if we believe in Others. We are therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in the same measures. Thus man strives to enforce control of the ever-present universe, to create a paternal caregiver (be it God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation of violence / conspiracy / murder / war, etc.)) meaning and symbolic order. Big Next provides believers with credibility. It is a "lifestyle choice" similar to religion in which its place in the world depends on total irrationality. The problem with most "conspiracy thrillers", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's "Topaz" to the modern fare like "The Da Vinci Code," is doubled. First, they are not wrong in suggesting that there is something "bad" between "elite" or "best people", but they are wrong in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social, collective and systemic, which means it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures. Second, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Big Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order for pulling strings. Some Modern "Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz," etc. They recognize that, with their unmistakable cobwebs of lies, accidents, truths and half-truths, nothing that can never be done add up, nothing that makes sense, real and hyperreal, truth and desire, all blurred, without any identifiable zero point, but these are mostly films of intellectual directors. Compared to these modern "conspiracy thrillers", "Marathon Man" and "Falcon and Snowman" they are positively archaic. "Marathon Man" is about a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who has been involved in the trade of his big brother (Roy Scheider), unfortunately related to spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is amazing, Hoffman is great, and Schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals (the revelation of the Eiffel Tower is stunning), but what is most interesting about the film is the way his various lines of plots do not cross into a 1-hour brand. Even then it takes half an hour for things to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with cliché clearing between a criminal and a good guy, all neatly resolved and explained. The "Falcon and the Snowman" is a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works with a civil defense contractor and smuggles information from his office and into the hands of Penn, a small drug dealer who has no doubts that the KGB sells. Penn does this strictly for money as Hutton is disillusioned with the US government (particularly his attempt to depose the leader of Australia) and thus sells secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and espionage games. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy that was done in response to a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "Falcon and the Snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> In addition to the special slapstic car crash and its clichés, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller, with some neat scenes. "Falcon and Snowman" is even better, Penn turns in unforgettable performance.
