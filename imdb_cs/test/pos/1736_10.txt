I really enjoy Dr. Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't take me as a "science fiction" because I'm not normal. I got caught because my friend hooked me when they started watching him. It's actually really funny, and more often than not, it's a fast pace. All my families are watching and it's a miracle. Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is great. I think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little quirk in a TV character. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is about, but everything works like a watch. <br /> <br /> All I say is just a try. One episode (probably the best if you don't choose the other half of the double-bar).
