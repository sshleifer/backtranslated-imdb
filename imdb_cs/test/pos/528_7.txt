I was a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London and I was very excited to see this movie on the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has great shots, superb soundtrack and interesting insights into "not so well known" London. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in "dark" colors that I don't like a lot. Besides, the narrative was a bit too British and the comments sometimes got into a small apartment. Other than that, there are some great Londoners comments and excellent pictures. FINISTERRE did not celebrate London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but rather giving a deep look at what London really likes. From the east to the vibrant center with its music scene, as well as 'special little retreats' for London guests. <br /> <br /> Total in all: <br /> <br /> + Great Soundtrack + Nice shots + great insights <br /> <br /> -Tiering to watch times br /> <br /> It's worth watching! I give it 7/10
