Although I saw this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, the images certainly say more than enough. From what I can do is this story: Two excellent sword fighters become friends on duty as a royal guard. One of them is against the king and begins to murder important men. The other must hunt him. This movie is visually great. Fighting swords is great. And the film has an ending. I hope this film will be released to Western film visitors. Of course they will be released on DVD.
