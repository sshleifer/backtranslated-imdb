ALICE is a film they made in the 1930s and 1940s. He never tries to be an "event". She just wants to have fun. And he does it. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a clich√©, he made it real. The plot alludes to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. The one dressed in white passes through the hole and Kiefer falls down. Like ALICE, the plot turns and turns, but with the freshness you don't see in small movies. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
