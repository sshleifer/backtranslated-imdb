If you've never experienced what Zasu Pitts is, here's Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel carved Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for Fleischer's study animated version of Popeye's comic book. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) makes her best "Olive Oyl" impersonation walk around whining and ringing hands or connecting to a police bench. I waited for her to say "ohhh myyyy", but instead it is "something that happens to someone." For the first time when I saw this movie, I loved it again and found that her character was really funny. Since then I have seen her in other movies, where she does the same whining, excitement, delicate routine of flowers. After watching this movie again, I began to bother a bit of constant whining and hysteria on a piece of dust. But here are some funny comedies and it's also a mysterious movie. It's an interesting blend of mystery and comedy that really works. The mysterious land is held together by the Zasu Pitts camp and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Crimmer's cop. Haunted house is fun with many secret passages and even skeleton in the attic! Worth a watch. Read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
