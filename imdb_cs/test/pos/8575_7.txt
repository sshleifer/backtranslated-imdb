I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to be in place for a pleasant, if not pioneering, film. It was laid out in southern France, good looking and recognizable actors led the cast, and I really admired live African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite all this, I didn't love him. It is believed that the films have their meaning to express at first viewing, but "Secret Laughter" does not. Nimi and Matthew, playing Long and Firth (both of whom played romantic leadership before and should have known better), radiate as much heat and passion as dried fish. I purposely used "dried fish" because it was one of the few - too few - of strong lines and moments that were sprinkled over the entire length of the film. Another winner was when Nimi catches Matthew to stab around her apartment. He found a book with her first name on it and says, "Your name is Nimi. I never knew." Then he insists he calls him his Christian name. I watched this scene closely when Matthew asked Nimi again and again to say "my name" and realized that they were always called their names until then. I thought this was a break for the movie and I expected it to be better. No. Why does Nimi and Matthew always seem to be ten paces, even in that scene, say "my name"? What does Matthew have on Nim except her obvious beauty? And why would a reasonable woman like Nimi fall for a comic writer who would consider his marriage something he could postpone when a beautiful exotic "adventure" came? And I would like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind the romance of adultery. Yes, Jenny is a sinister harpy, but if I was in her shoes, but I would probably deal with her Cruella tactics to prevent my husband from wandering. Believe it. The story suggests that Nimi is a painful past, but never fully explores it. Some critics say that Firth looked a bit embarrassed and I agree. For the sake, the actor summoned a more tangible desire and passion, as Mr. Darcy's snob from the early 19th century (and wearing those outrageous British)! As for Longa, who shined in 'Love Jones', there were times when he seemed more focused on his accent than on her character. Still, there were many moments? the scene "say my name" between them? when she was totally in control and hit really well. But "secret laughter" is not without its redeeming qualities, and I have found that more perspectives have grown up on me. Nene was well portrayed as supportive and well meaningful, though he did not fully understand Nimi's attraction to Matthew. I really liked it when Nene struggled with Mama Fola in those dueling proverbs. My husband liked him, and usually he is the first to sigh and offend on the screen if he doesn't like what's going on. He even laughed on the scene when Sammy asked Matthew for some honest questions about sex. Here you go. "Laughing Laughter" was good enough to entertain a curious man like my hubby, but a passionate movie viewer like me would need more than one review to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey.
