Not every line in comedy is funny. This film has a serious subject, the alienation of voters and holding it to the light while joking about it. It's the movie The Daily Show, which he would do if he wanted to turn it into a film. I found Robin Williams to be more entertaining in this film than in RV. And while my wife and I share several opposing political views, we both laughed in laughter in several parts of this film. The scenarios here could give Fox News some fair and balanced lessons. Lewis Black was fine for his part, but he never seemed to be able to carry his particular comedy brand for his part. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his fairly common subdued supportive role and promoting the story.
