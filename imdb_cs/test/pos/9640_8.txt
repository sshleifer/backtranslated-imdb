An exciting, action-packed and intriguing film telling the story of a group of men stationed on a naval base in Italy and their adventure aboard a Navy submarine during World War I. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends and I have to say he's a couple of very nice officers. The new captain comes aboard, already known by several "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston) and is a true stickler for following the rule book and "Code of Honor". Soon, Tommy and Brick are chasing an attractive blonde dancer, Tommy insults the captain - and of course the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway as he and his daughter creep away from the dance to the street carnival outside and soon get together during the raid - unfortunately for him, he reveals he's married. Later, Tommy gets into some real trouble when he doesn't hear orders to save his friend. This movie is quite entertaining with the immersive plot line that has captivated my interest and excellence in everyone. The High Death Scene, representing Sterling Holloway, is really scary - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Here, Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante are adding some humor playing a pair of goofballs - Durante's character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail-order and constantly has a coastal run-ins with a British man who makes fun of his nose. Okay - if you're looking for a movie that shows a man who is a kangaroo, it wouldn't matter.
