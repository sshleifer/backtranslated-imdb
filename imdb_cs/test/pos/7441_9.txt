I like this movie very much. The animation is the highest: that is, they tried to revive hair and hair on animals and humans. And being an amateur in graphics and animation (learning through books myself. For those who are curious about the same thing, I use Gmax by Discreet. It's a high-quality free downloadable program) on high level. The story of this film is good. Although this film lacks character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I believe that this film should be primarily watched by people who are fans of the game, because its action closely follows the game. As for me, I do not play games, so I do not have a wowing effect that it probably does on the game fans. <br /> <br /> For those who like the game, I recommend this movie, and if you haven't played the game, I would recommend this movie.
