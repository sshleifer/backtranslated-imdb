The unmistakable title conceals this firmly rooted example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, this film proves a very successful hodgepodge of several diverse elements: period work, romantic drama, crime film and political thriller. Interestingly, even though they were made by Fox, his protagonists? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? both were usually associated with other studios; Their chemistry on screen is palpable and ultimately led to marriage in a few years. While a little too young, Taylor is a lively hero (Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to uncover the culprits behind the organized cleaning of many banks); Not surprisingly, he was watching them unnoticed (led by smooth Brian Donlevy and thuggish Victor McLaglen) to fall on the chanteuse (naturally Stanwyck) who threw his hand with the gang? although the truth is said, singing is far from being an acting forte! Similarly, in addition to having to prove his worth to get behind his scenes, he has to fight McLaglen for Stanwyck's attention; By the way, the former joker personality of the former reminded me of a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933), who, incidentally, was directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two minds about involving Stanwyck in the approaching bait and trying to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl? but a jealous opponent disrupts his plans. The magnifier has vanished, we find Donleys dead and two more in jail; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention? in the meantime, has he learned the elusive and apparently prominent identity "inside man"? they are seemingly intermittent when the president murdered himself (a big conspiracy, though the resulting eleventh hour of tension feels sharp)! If you want to return to a film of styles, even if the obedience of the listeners is a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows it down and plunges it a little into the aspect of thriller, which really looks like a nice production? he has already mentioned with actors that they are supported by, for example, John Carradine (who is irreversibly disappearing on one scene!), Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and as two US presidents Sidney Blackmer (lively Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley).
