I loved this movie I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends and this movie was very real. I related to everything and enjoyed every moment. The characters are believable, the story annoying and the end realistic, but not sentimental. I also talked to the director after the performance. This film shows very good mixing but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The support cast was beautiful, depicting the life that tourists encounter in India quite realistically. Humor is subtle and occasionally dry, and it is all the more realistic as it is woven into everyday characters' escapades. It is so easy to identify with each of the displayed situations.
