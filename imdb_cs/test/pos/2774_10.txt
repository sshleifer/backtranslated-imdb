Don't miss the good old days when Disney really made great movies that really made you move? When I grew up with Disney, I always found myself subdued by characters. Each of them seemed really gifted and knew how to act in the film. I remember Friday night and running to turn on the TV just to watch their latest movies. Susie Q was one of my favorite favorites. I've never forgotten this movie. Even today, when the song "Susie Q" is mentioned, I always remember the movie. If someone is thinking about watching this movie, I promise you that you'll fall in love with it. I don't think I can ever forget it. You won't regret watching it. Unfortunately, it is sad to see Disney movies, such as The Hannah Montana Movie. What happened to Disney?
