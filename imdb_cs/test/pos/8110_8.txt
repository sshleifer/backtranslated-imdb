Hynkel, dictator Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry when he can't get what he really wants ... And what he wants is nothing less than the world ... <br /> <br /> In one of the extraordinary scenes from Chaplin's art, Hynkel performs with a "world" ballet that bursts when he thinks he has his understanding ... Chaplin also has some biting words about war and war movies. In the scene at the beginning of the film, which takes place during World War I, a Romanian messenger crashes on a plane and thinks that ... He will die ... In delirium he starts to say ridiculous words ... Empty double talks go up to a brilliant takeoff at all In another scene, when she becomes a refugee in the Jewish ghetto and takes command of resistance that provokes rebellion among old men, she plans to kill a dictator ... One of the group has to kill the ruthless conqueror of Austerlich ... Who is chosen naturally dies, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in the history of Toman ... <br /> <br /> The order in which he and the four other characters eat creamy cakes containing coins to determine which to sacrifice their lives to murder a dictator is a bitter cheerfulness filled with great fear ... <br /> <br /> For all theirs disappointment, "The Great Dictator" is still an important film for the ironic tones of the film to add something that even Chaplin could not give her: the irony of history ... The need to assassinate Hynkel is pretending to assassinate Hitler's generals ... imitating history. art ... <br /> <br /> With a wonderful sequence, such as a duck-shooting accident that leads the dictator to be mistaken for a humble Jewish barber and vice versa, "the great dictator" is Chaplin's first talking film. This time 'Charles' and not 'Charlie,' I want more than through my film and not a fun comedy, the last one in which it uses its famous 'Tramp Character'.
