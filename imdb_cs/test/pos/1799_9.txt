"Valley Girl" launched the career of Nicolas Cage and was 80's version of "Romeo and Juliet". It is a clear example of the 80's of teenage classics. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily have a brilliant picture in this movie, but "Fast Times on Ridgemont High" is never reflected because it is the ultimate teenager of the 80s because it wasn't for the "Fast Times", then the 80s. A teen flick would be just a big blow to the head. That's for sure.
