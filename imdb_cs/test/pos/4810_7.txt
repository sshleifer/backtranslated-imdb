This film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless Hong Kong triads that I have so tired of. There are no spectacular weapons battles. No car chases. And practically what to talk about. The audience is largely kept in tension, although some aspects of Andy Lau's "Trick" are quite obvious. The film was celebrated as a departure from the genre of violent triad films, and as an "intelligent" criminal film. To some extent it is. But to some extent still fails in the "credibility" test. We can hardly imagine any member of the triad being so stupid that he does not see Andy Lau's female disguise per second. It also seemed to have fallen on "if someone was seriously ill, said someone will cough up abundant amounts of blood regularly", what Chinese movies seem to go all the time. The subtle relationship between the two leading figures is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> Everything in all the fun movies, though the concept is not new and there is little surprise. >
