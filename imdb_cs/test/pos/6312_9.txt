This is a very visual movie. I mean, the dialogue is scattered, almost to the point where it's a silent movie for some very long times, starting with the opening shot. Silence, however, is interrupted by a stunning sound track that ranges from mismatch, staccato beats to a haunted mixture of violins, and scattered with vocals that sound like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as well as for the eyes, one of the first paintings is a man walking down the street, so impressed by his interest in a beautiful woman that he goes to the lamppost: one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in the store. .. <br /> <br /> Long ago, another movie? Love Story (1970) - said that love never has to say you apologize. This narrative turns this idea into a head in many ways, from the main character, Tita (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly harmless long-term resident of a luxury hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, a week, sitting at the same coffee table, enjoying a passing world, cigarettes, coffee, his loneliness? and it has been doing it for ten years. He sits, watches, and once a week devotes himself to three very surprising activities that you will learn when you see this little masterpiece ... Love is explored in another way, direct counterpoint to Titti alone and dedicated nature: Two elderly hotel residents are still very in love, but one wants to die in a spectacular way when his time comes while his long-standing wife considers him cheating cards with other guests, one of whom is Titta. Titta now knows about their quarrels, their love, the cheating of a man, his apologies to his wife and his whining. As? Surprising and black-comedic ... one of the surprising activities I mentioned. But in reality it's not a comedy, even though it touches on the idea of ​​human comedy in the Balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision was made to Titt ten years earlier when he left his wife and started living in a hotel. Sometimes he keeps in touch and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grew up) and grief in his voice speaks loud. But there is more than just grief ... <br /> <br /> Such a life as Titta would seem to be totally boring and in fact it is from many angles. Only when we find out what lies beneath his almost deadly face, the horror of his situation hits the viewer between his eyes. But not before we know that barmaid, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and goes out of her interest to be interested in Titty's interest. And that's when things start to crumble. Titta: eventually succumbs to her femininity and thus reveals the consequences of love. Ironically, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, in the most spectacular fashion. I know that all the above facts are somewhat mysterious; But telling more would spoil the film and the story. If you like Italian cinema? I love it! ?? I urge you to see it. The effect is excellent; the sound track freezes the spine; working with the camera is truly innovative; direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll see this movie over and over again ...
