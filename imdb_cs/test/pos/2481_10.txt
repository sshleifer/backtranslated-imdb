Set in a California POW camp in a vague future, the English film crew captures the management of how young students and political dissidents are brought to justice under a fictitious uprising law that allows the United States government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in case of bail or the necessity of proof . In such cases, the government is entitled to detain and detain anyone who believes they can engage in future sabotage activities. The group includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. Those who have been condemned by a conservative tribunal have a lengthy prison sentence or three days in a criminal park where they can achieve their freedom by reaching the American flag in the desert. He must do this without food or water. They are also being watched by armed national guards and police who can return them to camp if captured to face the punishment sentenced to every person convicted. The reality is different; those who choose the Punishment Park are hunted and killed or brutalized without any hope of gaining freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park. The park seems to be a police and guard training ground that needs to cope with these acts of suppression so they can be used in an open American society. Shot at 16mm and in documentary style developed by Watkins, in his famous Culloden and controversial The War Game for BBC; he works with prisoners and guardians to observe the unconstitutional court proceedings that they intertwine to create an absolutely convincing political film that is still essential and relevant. Watkins made use of his knowledge of the medium and created a driving, relentless, and finally horrifying film portrait of a totally fictional American political prison camp that would not be convinced if it wasn't for his flawless construction. Many actors are amateurs improvising with broad characters. The sparks fly in the trial scenes where each case is heard, in part because Watkins has kept those in court from jury to filming these scenes. Watkins also claims that actors often express their own opinions, which certainly explain fury, as well as the credibility of their performances. The film was strongly criticized for the polarization of those who see it. It has been claimed that film is reactionary and unambiguously represents that conservatism and war are the root of American social problems. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to realize that the film is working on a fictitious, metaphorical level, and perhaps a realism that makes the film so clever, supporting such a fiery view of its content. The most important topic of the film is actually the problem of polarization. "Conservative" judges and brutal lawmakers are on the one hand, and "liberal" convictions are clearly on the other without concessions on both sides. It seems that is what the movie really is about. The new law and the park itself are the result of a loss of mediation between the two political positions. During the war and during the protest against the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed the war in America, the main themes of government persecution of its own citizens and conservative civil liberties still face the same chord in the Patriotic Law era and ID card. It also interferes with the disturbing chord with footage from Guant√°namo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners in the hands of Allied forces. The threat of internal "terrorism" is so unstable that film cannot fail. connect with current attitudes to the topic. Not surprisingly, the film had a rich history of distribution that was limited to content because of the content, but the worrying fact that this film is still relevant today suggests that waiting was nothing. Penalty Park is a film that has to fight to be seen anywhere and requires your attention.
