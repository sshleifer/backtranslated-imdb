"Rush in Rio" is undoubtedly one of the most interesting DVDs I have bought. Although I am a biased Rush fan for almost 20 years, I have found that this performance is flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile ... it's like being able to capture every concert I've been on. For every Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if anything, just see the documentary "Boys in Brazil" (which reveals the paths of this rather isolated, personal band). For all non-Rush fans, this DVD is a pleasant concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have stood them for a few years. I have shown this DVD (or parts of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or to those who think that Rush is less than good because they have no appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (ie Sex, Drugs, and Drunken Madness) ). The bottom line is that the DVD is worth every penny and more than worth it to get it.
