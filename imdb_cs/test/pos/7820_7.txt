Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in the Bronx family of baking. Although Polonis was noted for their sweets over decades, trade fell on hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is the most talented dessert maker in Manhattan, but can't seem to land the main confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. The accidental encounter between Marco and Grace leads to a discussion of a possible solution for both. There is a high profile bake-off, the Golden Beater, which takes place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. For the winner, a large amount of "dough", haha, is enough to put Grace in the business and save Polonis. Grace reluctantly agrees. However, there are complications. Some judges and contestants may have had problems with Grace and Marco in the past. And then, while Marco and Grace both feel the attraction for each other, Grace has a long, very rich friend. Can Marco and Grace win the competition? It's a beautiful movie for a romantic heart. First, there's a nice cast. Holly has always been a beautiful actress with a remarkable hoarse voice that supports her attractions. In this film she is perfectly cast as a determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, will also delight himself as a good-looking opponent. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, are pretty nice. As Hallmark's film, costumes, suites, and production equipment are off remorse, and the script still manages to seem fresh and humorous, despite some familiar topics. Indulge yourself, the lovers of romance, the sweetest candy by ensuring viewing this movie. It is definitely the film equivalent of a large box of quality chocolates.
