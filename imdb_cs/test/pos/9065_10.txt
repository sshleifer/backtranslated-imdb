I really loved this original script and the different places that took me, emotionally, spiritually, and just plain stupid things. In the script or in the actors, I did not get caught up in "credibility", nor did I think about it until I read the reviews listed in the IMDb for the movie. Listen to Michael Parness talking on Q&A about his idea of ​​the movie, he wanted to see how crazy people, or "f'ed" up people, as he said, falling in love is really interesting. I found that I did not have a story book romance and liked to see the dysfunction of the best. I like to watch David Krumholtz in whatever he does and follow his career for several years. I believe this is his best job and tell anyone, just look at this movie to see the amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo Díaz was really a scene thief, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson. In this movie, I laughed and screamed, and I was disappointed that he had not received any awards at the festival. I'll ask why it didn't happen. I gave Maxi and Grace ten because these interesting, unique, creative films deserve an audience. Technically watch this movie, is it really beautifully done? The colors are amazing and ultimately it's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in the movie.
