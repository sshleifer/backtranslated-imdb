I went to see this movie with my lady who doesn't like heist movies. But she likes it. I missed pieces and pieces of film all the time It's a story about Edward Norton and the crew who steals some gold, and Norton decides he wants it all. Then the people he betrayed want to return to him. It's a well-designed, intelligent, fun and action-packed movie that I have to see again ... all the way. One of my best movies for years yet. A great benefit for entertainment is Seth Green. I dont know someone who doesn't like Seth Green, and adds to the taste. He plays a guy who says he created Napster and his roommate stole it. It's a brilliant computer that's wondering to watch. It has been said that Norton does not want to do this movie .. but if I were his, I would like to sign up. br /> <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie go-er should be able to say in its own mind what's going on before it happens. My biggest complaint about the movie is Eddie Nortons's selection of facial hair. A strong but thin mustache and a small pike on his chin ... looks like an 80-year-old star for the gods.
