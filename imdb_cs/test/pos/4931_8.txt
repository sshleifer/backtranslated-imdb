According to this reviewer, the best time to be a child in the 1990s, when cartoons were not censored heavily, and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family fun that hit the air waves. The best animation producers on Saturday morning were at Warner Brothers Television, who had a great golden age with Steven Spielberg's dream team, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with serious and dark series like Batman, they also revived the zany, the bizarre cartoons that made Looney Tunes famous. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with his dark adult humor and celluloid tribute from ancient times and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular by reinventing Looney Tunes for the next generation, while still maintaining crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy, can hold any age group, no matter how old. Even when Tiny Toons was drawn to feature-length with How I Spent My Vacation, it didn't feel like a longer TV series episode, a curse that so often plagues other features-length adaptations of popular animated shows. /> <br /> Tiny Toon Gang is a young cushion of classic cartoon characters who laughed in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning a comedy about making a toon title. Summer vacation started and every character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start fighting with a water gun that eventually leads to Acme Acres flooding and both float around Mississippi. Regimental Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a cross-country trip to the happiest amusement park in the world, but the Hamton family turns out to be more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other stories scattered around the world, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat that can hug and squeeze, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to date her favorite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail) Matthius)) goes to the cinema with the loud mouth of Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). While the premise is for a feature film, many directors and screenwriters do all the stories well together. The best of them is the unfortunate trip of Plucky, who makes good use of the golden comedy opportunity: to feel compassion for someone while laughing at their instability. Plucky's angry reaction to all the bad things that happen to him is the perfect combination of script and animation, all in the space of a small car full of pork. The story of Elmyra definitely occupies second place just to find out how a small, almost innocent girl can cause fear in so many jungle animals. The above-mentioned violence is definitely coming to the fore with the story of Buster and Babs, who makes us smile not only because of the results, but also nostalgically, because Ruegger and society might not be able to show half of what was then. in this segment. Virtually half of this segment plays the role of a parody and a tribute to Deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene, representing an unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures song. Part of the Universal Attraction of Tina Toons It is that humor is very intelligent because it focuses on those with fury that proves that it does not deserve the title of "children's fare" that seems to be people tread him. The entire Fowlmouth bad label segment at the cinema sneaks fun to the yappers in a perfect way, along with another logo on the Lucasfilm THX logo. This scene is done so perfectly that it should be presented in front of every cinema. There are also a few moments that poke fun at Disney World, movie hole holes and even the Warner Legal Department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and non-creative makes these intelligent moments even more precious because there is likely to be no more animated series that comes close. After watching how I spent my first time in many years, I can safely say that they don't do cartoons the way they used to be. With the continuing censorship that today's family entertainment accepts, one asks whether something like this is ever happening. This review is not just a recommendation for a really clever film, but also a plea from Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to reunite and re-create magic. The Lord knows that 21st century children need something with Tiny Toon Adventures. It is not a simple cash grab, it is an amazing movie full of spirit, madness chaos and merriment.
