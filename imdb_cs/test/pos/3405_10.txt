I was 13 when this mini-series (and its sequel North and South, Book II) aired for the first time. I've already been captivated by stories of personal interest in our American Civil War, which is what I was interested in watching this TV-made program. I loved him. And now I am 29 years old and I only love more. It is full of history, beautiful costumes, real life characters that are woven in the lives of fictional characters that you are all deeply interested in. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battle, victory, defeat and reconstruction. Although I had a whole series of episodes on tapes, I noticed back when I purchased a full set of N&S and N&S II from Columbia House a few years ago when they were available. I take a whole weekend and watch all the repayments every few years - and I'm sad when the last episode ends because I want to continue to watch the life story of these characters. br /> <br /> I can't recommend this mini-series more.
