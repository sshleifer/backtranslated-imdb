"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. I find it difficult to believe that anyone after seeing the film felt indifferent to the film or its message. Tim Robbins is not trying to impose his thoughts and beliefs on the audience, but he can create a film that in most cases is sympathetic to both views on the death penalty - no matter how good it is to murder a killer. I have always known where I stand on this issue, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it does not really care about any party - convinced me in my belief that it can never be the right murder * by anyone *. Sean Penn is absolutely great in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his Oscar nomination has been well deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage did a great job in "Leaving Las Vegas", I'd be happier if Penn won the award. Susan Sarandon is also great and she earned an Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the voice I gave this movie: 9/10!
