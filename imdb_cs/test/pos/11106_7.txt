Late night on BBC1, he was on his way to bed, but the curiosity of spicy on contemporary Irish film, so I kept watching for a few minutes and then stayed to the end. I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress Kelly Reilly, who is stunning when she looks at her. This is billed as a black comedy that is one of the toughest things to pull out. . It should be a perfect blend of horror and terrible laughter, so you don't know why you're laughing - for me, the best example of After Hours (1985) is Martin Scorsese. Dead bodies are more black than comedy, but plot along spirals toward more blackness. I haven't seen the latest twists in the story because some of the other posters were here, so I was appropriately surprised. As a picture of the Irish film industry in 2003, it seems to be all good; he doesn't seem to spend too much on his work, so he had a chance to return his money. The script could be much sharper, but acting was pretty good overall. I'm glad I watched it, mistakes and all, I don't think I learned much about Ireland today, especially their police methods!
