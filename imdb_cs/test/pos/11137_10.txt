This show was incredible !!! I've seen all three and this is the best. This film has tension, a bit of romance, pieces that will blow your mind (GO BOBBIE), great characters and amazing places. Where was it filmed? Will there be more? I really liked the story with my brother. We look forward to Chameleon 4 and see how the world is still saved.
