I saw the movie when it came out first, and didn't know exactly what to expect. What followed the overture was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. Lush scores of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricuss (Doctor Doolittle and Wilie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as well as his mark on Broadway's music scene) and scored an incomparable John Williams. There is no bad song in the whole movie. Plus some of the most beautiful cinemas, costumes and movies I've ever seen in one movie. Not to mention the Oscar nomination presented by Peter O'Toole, and equally powerful performance, in my opinion, amazing Petula Clark. Given that Peter is not the same caliber as the singer, Petula, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that is, after all, everything. This is a faithful adaptation of James Hilton's excellent book and deserves to be valued for future generations. I recommend this movie for family viewing, although most men will consider this movie as "chick". But if you like a really great movie musical then this movie is for you. But be warned that Kleenex's emergency box is as important as popcorn for your viewing pleasure.
