I think the New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best review of the In the Mood for Love series when he said it was "dizziness with a romantic ghost that was missing forever." How true these words are! Truly romantic movies are so rare these days, while movies that contain lots of sex and nudity (which are often depicted in sad and gratuitous ways) are abundant. Given this film climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film feels like a breath of fresh air. In the mood for love, there is a condemned romance between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow," played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan," played by Maggie Cheung), whose husbands have an illicit struggle to "not be like them." they went together on lonely nights (while their husbands are gone "on a business trip" / "caring for a sick mother"), they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation to go too far.> <br /> For In The Mood for Love is a new classic among the "romantic melodramas" in the best sense, several factors are responsible: Firstly, the particular period of the film (ie 1960 Hong Kong) is faithfully restored to an amazing degree of detail. ), music (eg Nat King Cole) and the overall atmosphere of this film evoke nostalgia for this particular period, secondly, the award-winning, stunningly beautiful cinematography of Christopher Doyle creates an environment that not only surrounds His two main characters, but he seems to be crazy with a romantic desire in each of his sumptuous, carefully crafted frames. Don't be mistaken: The most beautiful film in 2001 was in the mood for love. (It should also be noted that the usual Wong Kar-wai hyperkinetic visual style is, of course, softened for this film, even though its color palette remains the same.) Thirdly Michael Galass's scary score, accompanied by slow motion sequences, such as Chan walking in his elegant clothes, Chan and Chow "looking at each other as they walk down the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that return to memory." The main score - which makes his instruments sound as if they were literally crying - is heard eight times at different points in the film and serves to highlight the sadness and desire that both main characters feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both perform beautifully (Leung won the Best Actor Award at Cannes) and will be able to create true chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The above elements combine to work together to create a movie that feels timeless, "dizzy romantic" and one word magical. In the mood for love, perhaps more than any other film in 2001, reminded me why I like to go to the movies. And I think it's the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
