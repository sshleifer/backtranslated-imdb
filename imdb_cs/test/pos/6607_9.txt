Take a topic that I didn't know very much about, and make it exciting, why not? In 1979, director Robert Altman said he didn't believe he ever made a real movie and that he expected one of these kids riding skateboards - if he didn't break his neck - to make the first film. Well, I wouldn't do such an expectation on Stacy Peralto, but he's a skateboarder who made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he used to use existing footage, and certainly it's a good thing that there were so many archival footage. Peralta adjusted it well with the extraordinary talking heads of his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense of the word, but it has happened. Altman's predictions could not be fulfilled. What Peralta did, however, is to capture the energy of those intoxicating days that we can appreciate when it comes to modern skateboarding invented by Z-Boys. That's all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown."
