I've read every Asterix and Obelix adventure at least 5 times and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I was expecting a lot from this movie ... and I'm finally happy. Unlike Asterix's first big screen adaptation (Astérix et Obélix contes César), which was not a real success in addition to Laetitia Cast's appearance, this film truly captures the spirit of comics (and we're getting beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic in terms of the story's time and killed the whole spirit that made Asterix cheerful. This is all the clothes, the way of speaking and everything the same as the work of Goscinny and Uderzo ... more, really sticking to the original story with the disadvantage that we know almost everything that happens, but Alain Chabat gave us a few surprises at the end. I really enjoyed the movie and every time the first signs of boredom start appearing, Jamel comes and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a big mix of all sorts of humor I like, and although it may be too much, I can't help but enjoy it. So if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (French mix of today's show and SNL), check out this movie.
