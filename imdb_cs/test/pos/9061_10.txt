Who would think suicide could be dealt with in a way that is tangible to everyone? I saw the SXSW movie at its premiere and it turned out to be the best movie out there. Yes, its distorted and bizarre, but in the world it makes sense, created by the director (Michael Parness). If you weren't allowed (most of them did), then you just wouldn't get it and that's a damn shame. Especially note, Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a lot of scenes and chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film reminds Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre spin after another, and they make sense in this crazy mixed world in which we all live. I stayed (as well as most) for Q&A afterwards, and what was great was to hear that the same things I thought in the mind of why "things" were the reasons they did it. I don't think you could say a lot about the movie if you didn't get it. I think I do, and everyone else seemed to do it. The film is nicknamed as a suicide comedy, but it has a lot of hearts, lots of laughter and offers a lot of hope, but it also avoids the horrors of suicide. A nice little movie that should get attention when it gets released, which will happen sooner than later.
