* May be spoilers * No doubt one of the best dramas, if not the best in the genre I've ever seen. Is Prot foreigner or just crazy? This is a question you will be asking throughout the film. Kevin Spacey is just amazing, just like Jeff Bridges. You can't beat this kind of acting and some humor. Some of the actions of Kevin Spaceys in this movie are very funny. For example, when he was in a tree and talking to a "queen" mental patient, he hid half his face around the wall and stared. <br /> <br /> You'll be addicted right from the start, and if you really love drama, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fixed 85%.
