This is a film about music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two Old World powers, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is almost 10 million megalopolis. So it's no surprise that there is a lot of music in Istanbul, with lots of voices, styles and influences from around the world. It is, of course, Turkish music and I have been fascinated by Turkish music since I first made my first record. The film includes various singers, instrumentalists and bands. The spoken commentaries of the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern Turkey. From my point of view, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, movies show urban scenery mainly from Istanbul, which is very nice to watch. "Crossing the Bridge" is presented as a documentary and includes minority music, such as Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz music, Armenian music and Greeks. This film is strongly recommended for music and culture lovers of Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It can also be useful for those who are interested in the global effects of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
