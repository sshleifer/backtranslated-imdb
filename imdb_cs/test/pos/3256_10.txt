So on Sunday I turned on the TV at 13:00 and I expected to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie just started, didn't know what it was, but immediately pulled me out. The film was excellent. There were a few things that didn't make sense for one I don't get why a dead guy talks about doing things to get out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic things that they would survive that someone would do it in their own situation, in other words, it was not his initiative that got him out of his bad situation, that it was only luck, secondly not. Get the thing about the girl killing gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partly caused by a thief who stole Panda's money, and then the other thief at the end kills Panda to steal money twice and kill him as good as that?
