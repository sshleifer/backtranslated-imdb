Some martial arts purists think comedy was the worst thing that could happen in the old school of kung fu; and it is true that the introduction of comedy into the genre signaled the end of the "chop-sock" period in Hong Kong film. The fact is, one can only carry a physical show of bravery for so long, then everyone is bored with it. And that's really why the chops died and how the "New Wave" action movie in Hong Kong was born: producers, actors, directors all got bored when people hit ninety minutes directly. Given that and because Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable number of films in his biography, this film must be perceived as something other than just another kung fu comedy. It is rather a comic book in the martial arts genre, and in fact one of the best he ever did. What Liu did with this movie is a really nice surprise: he took a combat action -rad plot and re-built it according to the line of Hollywood musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! It was at the time of this film that some filmmakers and film fans began to recognize that the martial arts movie performance (actually derived from the Chinese opera acrobatics) has more in common with dance than with combat. (I will continue to draw attention to this link until most Americans realize what they are supposed to look for when they watch a martial arts film - well choreographic body movements, using action film plot as an apology for their performance.) Liu Chia Liang decided that this he makes the connection and decides to explore him near his borders. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly glamorous fun full of amazing human characters trying to make a miraculous kung fu (and tripping over your own shoelaces as often as they do). and the film, which takes place at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, allows Liu to explore the nature of westernization and modernization of China, which has contributed significantly to China's creation we know today. Thus, the film also has considerable historical significance. Also, fans of the recent Kung Fu Hustle movie, Stephen Chow, should watch this movie closely as Chow has clearly learned of it before creating his own movie. br /> <br /> Very fun, well made movie. Oh, yes and kung fu is really, really good. Purists don't allow it, but this is probably Liu's best film.
