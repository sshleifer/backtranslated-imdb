I just got back to this kind of memory of a bit of film madness from my early days, and I must urge you to steal it or borrow it. The story begins with the struggle of the righteous priest Shaolin and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White digs a Buddhist ass, and his campaign against Shaolin disappears with the help of his new ninja allies (the golden canvas fighting the gold ring , a black canvas that fights the spear, and my favorite, the one who fights a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear like a flying carpet). The rest of the story relates to the training of Shaolin monk disciples killed by a white abbot, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. While we are being treated for punitive training sequences, both young avengers have to go through the Shaolin Finger Jab technique, which is needed to defeat the enemy armor technique, Abbot White, we see some ways in which our villain holds in shape ... mostly using Taoist magic to extract blood from naked ladies. We all know how it will end, but it's a psychedelic trip between what we're here for. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan did when Hong Kong was sick of martial arts movies and it is becoming more and more outrageous in martial arts movies. This movie is very well choreographic, has some nudity, some gore and enough balls to gimickry to entertain even the tired viewer. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
