It's hard to know what category this movie is supposed to be in, most of the films in this time of American history are western, but instead of the wide open plains in the west, the action is almost exclusively limited to claustrophobic girls in boarding school in Louisiana. The film opens with a young girl, Amy, who walks through the forests gathering mushrooms as she does, so she runs into Corporal John McBee McBurney, a wounded Union soldier to take back. school. We know that he is not particularly nice when he kisses her lips to distract her from the warning of the Confederate patrol, even though she told her she was twelve. Once you go back to your school opinions, they are divided on what to do with their new guest, some think they should take care of it until their wounds recover, while others think they believe it is betrayal to not give it to the Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The former group has won and is gradually recovering. As he does, his presence affects all the girls who have no men for a long time, including a young teacher and a major mistress who had a previous relationship with her own brother. McBee is about seduction, emotionally, if not physically, which leads to significant jealousy among the girls. Although this film is rated fifteen, it's definitely not for younger viewers both for sexual content, of which little is actually shown, but much is implied, and for a very exhausting scene that has brought me more than any other scene in any movie I've seen for some time. Interestingly, Clint Eastwood plays against the type, instead of being uncomfortable and most of the time at the mercy of women around him. The performance is solid not only from Eastwood, but also from all the actresses, including young Pamelyn Ferdin, who played Amy.
