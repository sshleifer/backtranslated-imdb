What I'm saying about this movie. Well for beginners, I thought this movie was fine, not the biggest, the worst. I said it because I thought the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. Now I wouldn't say it's the biggest movie I've seen the cause of acting. The actors who played each role seem to have played them emotionally, as if they had taken their lives out of them. When a woman laughed or screamed, for some reason it didn't look to me, that's just an example, but honestly all the characters didn't do at all. I wish I could say more positive things about this movie, so you can see it at least once, but how can I do it because I know I won't see it again. I rented this movie from my school library without hearing anything about the film or the director. I took the chance because the story that was described on the back was really interesting and it really was.
