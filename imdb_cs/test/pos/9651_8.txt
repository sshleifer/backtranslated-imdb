The reason I'm reviewing this is because the previous reviews were written by someone who left this movie, even half way. Unfortunately, he lacked a film of great beauty. I agreed that the film was very slow, in fact, the friend I was with had briefly fallen asleep, woke him up before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film evolved from a story of love, drugs and how it was to be young and free in the 60s. A fantastic performance from both leaders and a great look at the film that gave him a true authentic feel. Be patient as well as many great movies that are worth waiting for, and it's definitely a movie I'm looking forward to. 8/10
