From the moment they first came to Outer Banks and filmed a movie (I lived here all my life), I waited for this movie to come out. And I think I waited and waited and waited more than a year and a half for this movie and it was worth it. The film is different from the book, but in my eyes it's still a beautiful work like a book. I screamed in both, there were moments that tore me apart. I laughed and smiled anyway. It's a great movie with a great story line. It's about never giving up on someone who would change you forever. The one who will shape your soul and wake you up to a whole new perspective on life. I must say that one can meet someone and let them change life forever, which is what Gere's character did to Lane. I met with the love of my life and suddenly I was absolutely amazed that I never forgot it or how I was with him until the year I met him again. For me, I could relate to this film with all my heart. I think when you listen and watch a movie with your heart and hope, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, the great work of Mrs. Lane and Mr. Gere!
