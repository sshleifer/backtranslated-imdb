The black comic story of the downward priest Nazarina demonstrates the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to achieve by being able to tell a deeply humanistic fable with a minimum of fuss. As an output from his Mexican era of filmmaking, it was an invaluable talent to own, with little money and extremely tight plans. Nazarin, however, exceeds many of the previous Bunuel Mexican movies in terms of playing (Francisco Rabal's Outstanding), story and theme. The topic, interestingly, is something that has been explored again in Viridiana, made three years later in Spain. It concerns the struggle of man for mankind and altruism among a society that rejects any idea of ​​virtue. However, Father Nazarin is more sympathetic than Sister Viridiana. While the other chooses charity because it wants to atone for its (perceived) sins, Nazarin's entire existence and reason for being seems to help others, whether they like it (or we). The last scenes of the film in which he questions his behavior and in a fraction of a second have to choose between the life he has led or the conventional life expected of the priest are so emotional because they relate to his moral integrity and we are never entirely sure that it will remain untouched or not. This is a remarkable film and I would urge anyone interested in the classic cinema to look for it. It is one of Bunul's most successful films and contains many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, insane love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my opinion, "Nazarin" is second only to the "exterminating angel" when it comes to his Mexican movies, and is definitely near the top of Bunuel's overall film output.
