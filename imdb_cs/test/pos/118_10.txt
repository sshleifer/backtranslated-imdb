one of the best movies ever ... fire ... it's not about the sociological description of India today ... it's a mind blowing light that never stops, never happens ... normal ... though .. in that sense the film is almost unique ... both wires are of very good quality ... the origin of Dasu as a street artist is quite obvious ... its performance is an excellent "cammeo" ... but the use of light ... I look at it and watch on it, over and over ... still in mind blowing for ages ... nothing in the story ... rather "pure" way to face the topic ... in a way it's sad that in a bizarre world where today we live, is a major work of art commonly known as gender film ... Fire can be faced with Dryer Jeanne D 'Arc or Ichikawa Biruma no Tategoto or some of them. major Kurosawa movies, just name "some". I wish my entry would help a little of this film on his well-deserved path to fame.
