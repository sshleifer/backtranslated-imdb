Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres into a head, and Chan-wook Park, the latest celebrated director, is a story of a good godly priest who becomes a vampire. Add a seducer who leads him astray and casts eccentrics and has an amazing recipe. It is driven in part in a style that is similar to the "Sympathy" trilogy and is as sumptuous as it is dark. Control without clich√©s offers new tricks in the vampire genre. It is an existential film that tries to capture the moral riddle of exactly how one has to choose to live with its conditions rather than look forward to lust. However, the film is not taken too seriously and there is unlimited humor. <br /> <br /> Our leaders play their part in perfection, playing with our emotions and pampering in dark humor. There are reflection moments on all moral puzzles involved in the film, but its never preaching. Some might find it too long and it can calmly in points, but it is worth giving a chance to the end. <br /> <br /> If you like the left box movies then there is less better than this late. Dark and riveting, it will pull in the crowd. I suggest you try it.
