Images control this movie. Characters, though interesting, eventually get a back seat. The first scene I remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean, which then opens to full screen and color. Water overflowing emits a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film is that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. Water as the final consciousness, as an instrument of God, is used here to force people to get their "houses" in order (the day of judgment). The dead must be counted and brought to a better place. Whether someone is left unresolved or unsettled, it will be washed away. There is no clinging to the past, a buried memory of what was. This film was compared to O, the brother of Thou's art, and the threat of water and its use as purifying power is similar to film. Otherwise, in this film, the arrival of water is noticeable, and therefore again the emphasis is on what needs to be done here and now. I agree that some scenes resemble the work of David Lynch. For example, take a dinner segment with a deeply expressed androgynous waitress. One gets the same surrealist feel from the setting, and the weird character as one does with the reverse spokesman in the scene from Fire Starter. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with a picture to express the psychological processes of a restless character, while this film probably uses surrealistic elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits can't have anything they want - they have to be patient and accept what's available.
