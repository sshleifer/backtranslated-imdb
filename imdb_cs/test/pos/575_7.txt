This is a pretty dark, stupid horror movie set in the 1970s at the Everglades. This is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts getting good for the last half. There is a scene with a hero running to save his friends scattered footage of the church singing group, I don't know. It's fascinating. I was impressed by the night scenes because it actually looked like a night, unlike most low-budget horror movies where it still looks like daytime. I feel the director was really talented, but he worked with a tiny budget and a hard plan. There are a few scenes to the end, one mentioned above and also end credits that are extremely cool. This movie could be a real classic if it left its Scooby Doo convention and went straight into the throat. I was surprised how good this movie is. I couldn't pull my eyes out of it and have to ask myself why?
