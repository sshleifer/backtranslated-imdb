As for the competition elements at Split Film, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, the US and Australia and many of these stories suggest that the world is really a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. In Alex Frayn's film, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to coast to visit the grave and the uncle's house that has long since resurrected him and died in 1950. The coastal village looks like something in an American horror movie where the village is bizarre and people are unusual mutants. But episodes in Alex Frayn's pastoral care cannot be described as horror in the usual way. In fact, it is an extremely interesting drama where we see relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. In this story and thanks to the apparently psychological aspects of the actors, we show a peep show of the film charming eccentric Australian filmmaking. This is the case with Frayne. Always something new and fresh. Visual intelligence and the unique sensitivity of some Australian directors are amazing. Frayne's film is great. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their films so strange as we saw in FRAYNE Modern Love and in LYRAN and Jindabyne in RAY Lawrence. Frayne.
