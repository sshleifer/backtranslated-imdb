I grabbed "On the Run" in the screening hall in New York and was immediately seduced by his true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia of The Sopranos cast, "On the Run" puts us on a 24-hour wild ride in a city that never sleeps when we follow the meanders of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly pulled by his long school companion school, just out of prison . In fact, he has escaped and is "on the run" seeking action and a glimpse of life in the midst of a great metropolis. Powered by great performances, this film gives us an old sense of the 70s when both characters reappear as they blazing across the city encounter wild events and locals. "On the Run", which is on the first side of New York, which looks like disappearing, shows elegance and humor. I suppose this is a cult classic that encourages to be discovered: future viewers should definitely give up on this night trip.
