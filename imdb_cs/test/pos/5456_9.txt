The director is brilliant, casting is remarkable (though I'd like to see a little more Aaron Lustig (from Y & R's fame) who played Paul Shaffer). I have only two tiny pieces about the film, as fine. One-Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but his presence on stage (ie, while recording one of his late show episodes) is tad erratic. Two - spreading languages. I am willing to tolerate a nasty language if it is not used unreasonably and to some extent the film was unreasonable. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce Bates' pathos, otherwise well-illustrated by Kushnick, its frequent use, and to make Roebuck's Leno a good good lack of his use (of course, the characters behaved like this all the way) . However, in terms of television and video, this piece is excellent. I feel the film has the potential for a big screen, but it would require re-casting for bit parts and probably another director (Larry Sanders' aesthetic feeling, good for HBO). average for film purposes).
