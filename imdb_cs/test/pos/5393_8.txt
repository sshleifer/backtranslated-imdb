DALLAS returned to the "old-fashioned" Westerns of the 1930s and 1940s (eg DODGE CITY). Pulse-Pounding Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY et al.) Score. In addition, there is a masquerade, mistaken identity, false death and more hair leaks than the Republic series. As always, Cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure. Forget Western Anxiety 50's ... that's pure fun!
