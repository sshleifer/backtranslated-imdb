(Spoiler Warning) I can't say a lot of good things about this movie. It's a great horror comedy / spoof that does everything to change. Humor is great and ranges from fun to fun. In one scene Ed edits crazy and removes the big scene. When his boss looks at Ed's editing, he shouts, "Where is my scene in fu?" Hysterically. There are also many other great, funny and unforgettable quotes and moments in the series: Ed yells, "You don't look to me! while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face. Very funny. The storyline itself is so ridiculous that it is priceless: Ed is a slightly raised everyday person who gets to the horror movie editing department and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters and attacks people in citing horror. movies he edited. This film has everything and is just cheerful. The DVD only costs about $ 7, and it's a great advantage because it's an unrated wide-angle cut. I own a lot of DVDs, most of which cost a lot more money than this, but not many are as great as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it. Evil Ed radiates style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers have to learn. Evil Ed is a precious jewel and I would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie - you did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
