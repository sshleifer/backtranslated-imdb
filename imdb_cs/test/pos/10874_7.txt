I do not know if I would go so far as to say that this film belongs to a pile of 'Aussie trash', but it is fair to say that there are no Oscar candidates. What is to be taken into account is that most of the actors in this film were not really actors as such, only children who had nothing better at the time. There were many others that were offered roles in the film, but turned them down to go surf the coast; All things taken into consideration, it really wasn't a bad movie for his time. In some ways, this is not really the case today, when peer pressure is still alive and kicking, only without mobile phones, computers, and other similar devices that children have lived without this generation. Anyway, I have to rate this movie as an old fave I watched once in the blue moon and never took it too seriously ...
