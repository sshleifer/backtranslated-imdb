These films must have been the funniest movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I laughed so hard that I almost exploded. After the movie was finished, I laughed for about an hour, just thinking about the last thing I saw in the movie. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all again. If you are ugly or do not like nonsensical childish humor, you will not like this movie. If you can go with your mind open and take it so seriously, then you will laugh at your ass. His amazing nobody was killed in this movie. Everyone seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you won't know what to expect. Mike Webber
