This is a very good movie. I give it 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different in that it's a kind of long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is muted is used throughout the story in a very believable way. She sees murder (for a snuff film) and decides to run but time is being chased. I will not reveal the rest of the film because it would spoil the experience, but be sure: it is very credible, well played, very intense and has a few pleasant surprises and a great ending. Don 'Don't miss this movie.
