The film focused on a young lady praying to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think about other films like "Song of Bernadette" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong influence of Catholic faith in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming first, a student of a Catholic school and later as a young woman who buys a statue of St. Anne (which is the name of the street I live on) and makes many prayers for the Holy Intercession whenever problems arise in her life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from Andy Griffith's show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives. My local priest said my sister resembles Ann Blyth and both have the same names as first and middle. Nice good family movie that comes from an era where life was a little easier.
