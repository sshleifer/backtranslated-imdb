At the same time, John Russell played the owner of the ranch Nathan Burdette and tried to free his good brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, who worked on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the highest point of Russell's career, his most famous role on the screen and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. Russell held the law and order in Laramie in the same way James Arness did in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the tiny characters that added Dodge City to you at the time. Instead, he focused on Russell, who cared for business and learned the legislation of his eager young representative, Peter Brown. Brown played Johnny McKay's deputy, who was the most serious young man ever to refer to his boss. Mr. Vojte. He was quite handy when shooting iron, but he tended to be impulsive. Good thing Marshal Troop was around. Another series of regular was Kitty Russell of Laramie, Lily played Peggie Castle. Here, Lawman most resembled Gunsmoke. There was a misunderstanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest children could not miss. And I wasn't the smallest of the kids when Lawman was in the first run. Unfortunately, Peggie Castle has developed substance abuse problems after Lawman has finished. I remember that in the first half of the seventies her little obituary described her passing. She was one beautiful woman. Lawman wasn't a good no-nonsense western from the golden age of an adult television station. It was one of the best.
