I first saw this movie by mistake when it was shown on TV and I was too late ... I really was lucky. It's really incredible; out of place (as isolated as it can be on this planet; made a "gap" look like an ET in a council pool) through interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as a reaction child - "What if" Is it wrong about him? "-" Then we are wrong. ") And the consequences (more yucky than Alien). <br /> <br /> However, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. Knowing that one of them can - or may not be - "Everything seems to be." It's definitely a feeling of "who's going there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great; , fear and seriousness of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the episode scene really, really cuts in. Even more than "But then who's doing?" Punchline Bladerunner.
