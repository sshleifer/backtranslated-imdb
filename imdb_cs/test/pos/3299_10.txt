"Boy Next Door" is a merry skirmish over male neurosis. In less than fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most of the functions cannot accomplish. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing --- this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as director and star. Woody Allen is the funniest fool. And what it's like when Richard Moll returns. If you thought all he could do is play "bull" bailiff on "Night Court", think again. This gem of the film shows off brilliantly humorous writing by Stephen Garvey. Remember this name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is a true contemporary king of bizarre comedy.
