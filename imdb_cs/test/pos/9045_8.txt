It may not be 10 out of 10, but for me jokes have failed. I have seen it many times when I was younger and I believe again on the DVD, and I always laughed. Humor is simple and fun, this film was just one of the many little movies Disney had thrown at that time. I found parts where people from the invisible loop saw people invisible. Here the expressions were priceless Great movie, if there was an opportunity to see it, I suggest I see it for a good oh fashion laugh. My favorite character in all the Dexter series would have to be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and hear him getting angry, especially when he saw that his expression at the end was purely hysterical.
