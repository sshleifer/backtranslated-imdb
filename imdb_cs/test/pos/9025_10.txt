Okay, so it starts very unimaginively with narration from the main character (Justine played Laura Fraser - an amazing actress in her own right), but it becomes something miraculous. He has stupid little things that you shouldn't find funny but every time. There is a particularly unforgettable moment that sees your jaw dropping to the ground when you first look when a male body of Jake, containing Justine's female mind, tries to get used to her new anatomy. I didn't want to spoil you, but the second time I watched it with friends; seeing their faces was brilliant. It makes you cringe, but laugh at the same time. I am also a big fan of used music. There is a beautiful little band that appears randomly on the street or on the road every now and then, but also some wonderful but unknown (often best) pop songs. He feels he's written for an English cast by an American writer who only bothered me a few times. Overall, this movie is fun. I am a massive Laura Fraser fan after I got my movie for my birthday, and I expect that although some of those games are little known to most, you will enjoy it every bit.
