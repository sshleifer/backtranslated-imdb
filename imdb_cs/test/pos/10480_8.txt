If you find that the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. Also, the hearing of the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans who do not see and hear many Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed, it was better and better, and the viewer was rewarded for his patience. As a fan of "Out Of Africa", this film has aroused my interest because of Isak Dinesen's short novel (Karen Blixen), the main character of the film. The food - Babet's banquet - was amazing. I'm not a chef, but I was impressed! Also, as he interprets the story, he differs, I suppose it depends on how much you read and where religion stands. If the other, as you look at the definition of "legalism," can influence how you interpret this story. In any case, it's a great movie, but don't look at it if you're dieting.
