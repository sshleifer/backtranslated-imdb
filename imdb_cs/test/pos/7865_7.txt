This Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left in the landscape in 1971 and what a pity. Fascinating study of character with some great women for Squint to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our top actresses and is perfectly cast. Young Jo Ann Harris is flirtatious minx and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is undeniably suppressed. And 7 out of 10. Best Performance = C. Eastwood. Released in the same year as DIRTY HARRY, it meant nothing except getting good reviews. Look for it if you're not just in the movie "Explosion". Very gentle and scary, this piece will stick with you.
