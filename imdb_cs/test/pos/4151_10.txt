This movie played in Lexington KY for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of his run and regretted that I couldn't recommend it to others because it is a movie that calls for a great screen experience. The aerial image, where the crowded ship breaks away from the same crowded dock, is a masterpiece, as is the scene where the two main characters flirt on board - almost ballet and seductive in their suggestiveness than so many more exposed films these days. I just crouched to think that more people wouldn't be able to see this movie in the theater; the DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: if you live in a university town, find out if you can lobby to show yourself at the Campus Film Festival.
