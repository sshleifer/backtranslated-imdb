real love. true love. insane love. beautiful love. ugly love. dirty LOVE. sad love. happy love. silly love. intelligent love. beautiful love. silly love. love love love. Minnie Moore understands that what he really needs is a man who believes her, believes her and loves her insane. Of course, when this man comes ... he tries to escape, but the seymour, the wonderful seymour, believes her, believes in her to fight for her. I want to be like a seymour moskowitz. I want to be such a man. a man willing to love without being afraid to fail but willing to fail. This is a kind of hero. That's my kind of hero ... and Minnie Moore is my kind of woman. Long live cassavetes and all his lovely bunch!
