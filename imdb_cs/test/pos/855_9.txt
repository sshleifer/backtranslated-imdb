This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of them you'll scratch your head to make it come. She develops her mystery through the main character Eva and her psychotic college project in crazy asylum, Don. She needs to look for clues to defend herself from her mother's murder, and once Eve agrees to help him, she opens the pandora's box completely and releases very strange things, including Malachi. I'm not going to Malachi, but I thought what was being played was absolutely brilliant. I know film enthusiasts will not consider this film as the same prestige as other classics because it has no one famous in it (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe he should ask his sister to show her face like this movie could get some recognition) but I think that the way Malachi ends up is something we talk about. I recommended it to my friends, definitely worth buying or renting.
