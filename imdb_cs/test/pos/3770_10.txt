A blend of 70th humor medications along with a medical parody and classic storyline. As I have often said about this movie - if you don't do it - you're so lame ..... Classic lines like (paraphrase) "I have this erection and it won't be gone no Are you the sister you can give me? I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ... "Great sound track. Classic" Hyde has nothing to hide. "Stays surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original stays in the way of a joke ..... who would have an IQ over 115 that can't find it hysterically. <br /> <br />
