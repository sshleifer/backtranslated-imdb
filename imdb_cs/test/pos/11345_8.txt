In Hong Kong, 1962, editor Chow Moan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife and secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband move to the old building. Every couple just rented a room in the apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and suppressed love. Later they realize that their friends have an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably suppressed status of a married woman keeps love on a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photo and sound track and a very unusual release. The film had no screenplay, and the actors were never sure what to shoot. Later, the director edited his story based on the records. When Chow moves to Singapore, he has been in the story for many years until 1966, when his intention is deliberately open and not well defined, so questions like the boy are with Li-Zhen. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Amor Ã€ Flor da Pele" ("Love on the Skin Surface")
