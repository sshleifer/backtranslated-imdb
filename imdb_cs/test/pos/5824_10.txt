HBO has created this show in order to see us the most realistic view of prison possible and do the hell of a job. Oz was created by murder makers who wanted to show the crude version of the prison. This show is what kicked off the idea of ​​any other HBO Original program, such as Soprano, Sex and the City, Wire, Arliss, Deadwood, and Six Feet Under Among Others. Oz is a nickname for Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictional prison in any US state which is never given (Although with accents, crime scenes, and racial distribution of NY is presumed). Emerald City, the seemingly ideal prison unit with more privileges, than the others were invented by a liberal unit manager named Tim McManus, looked at the main prison unit. Overall, this show shows what it really is when you want to survive in prison. There are about 10 gangs on Oz. First we have Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustice of the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of blacks everywhere. They are led by Kareem Said a black militant minister who wants to destroy everything racist about the justice system. As a group they are not so much against white but rather against injustice. Our second group of blacks is Homeboys, who are basically street blacks who want to keep all the bad ghettos running and run a drug store. Their leadership differs mainly because they always lose members because of violence. In this group there is one character who has behaved terribly, Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African prisoner who is basically the most scary evil character alive. This gang, as a whole, occasionally receives side help from the Irish and is always at odds with Latinos and Sicilians for drug distribution purposes. Being that Oz is mostly black, Homeboys has most of any gang soldiers within. Latinos and Sicilians, like Homeboys have changing leadership due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show. The Sicilians largely have the most important word in how any illegal activity is done in Oz. Latin makes their presence known so that they can at least be coastal well if they are not in control. Unlike Homeboys, however, these gangs do not have so much power struggle and are usually more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irish people mentioned above are a smaller gang led by the manipulative and snakelike Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay in good grace with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants. They are not in illegal control, but at least in good conditions with all who are. Among the whiter prisoners we have Bikers and Aryans. Cyclists are just a few tattooed drug users who help the Aryans most of the time. Aryans are the most hated and hateful gang to most of every Oz viewer. They are led by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, worst and sadistic characters he will ever see. Both gangs control nothing illegal, just let the darker prisoners see that they are a major threat to anyone who thinks all the white prisoners are soft. We also have Others. Others are gangs of foreign prisoners who are not necessarily a problem for all other prisoners. In this group we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is eternally altered. We also see August's hill, a black man who is bound to a wheelchair to kill a policeman who tells a show and introduces all prisoners to the audience. Crime characters are shown as presented, and Augustus tells us how long they will be in prison. Finally, gangs are Christians and gays. Christians only remain religious to avoid mental and gay people are many cross-dressers who are often raped by other prisoners. This show deals in detail with many issues dealing with crime. and is clearer than any prison film. Since the language is untidy, we have more racial epithets and cuss words than we would on any other TV show. August Hill gives us a good way to understand every problem that concerns Oz. This show as good as it is is not at all for light to middle heart. This explicitly shows the use and distribution of drugs in any way possible, rape in prison, murder, deadly housing and general gore than anything else anyone else has seen. In my opinion, it is the most influential and greatest show he has ever created, but at the same time I can see why other people might be disturbing this show. If you are interested in exhibitions and movies about prison, Oz must see.
