This is by far the funniest sitcom ever broadcast on television. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and I literally could watch them over and over again. Anyone who doesn't find this show cheerful, gratifying, funny and laughing loudly hysterical is crazy! Kevin James is one of the most talented comedians. My friend and I like to stand up to a comedy show in Boston (where we live) and we've seen Kevin James and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) twice. They are both incredibly talented and simply plan smart with their work. There are so many comics that they're just terrible, and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of the real comedy. Leah Remini, although a real-life snob and bitch (so I read) is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms. She really does a show ... along with Jerry Stiller! This show is visible and you'll be addicted to one or two episodes!
