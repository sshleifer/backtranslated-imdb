First let's name this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. Acting is fine, dialogue slightly better, production value pretty good. 3. Rugby scenes ... hardly clear. But here's a trick: this is not something Hollywood would have invented, and it's not trying to be cruel about the exact representation of sport. Instead, it is a fairly good representation of mostly real people, under real circumstances and a real story. Sure, they could do a better job of actually rep'ing the sport, but my voice: it does a pretty good job of doing what they do to do. <br /> <br /> (I can't think of much football, baseball, hockey or football movies that are loyal to sports, either ... Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I'm not a rugby player ( I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, attended '86 -'90, and occasionally trained with Rugby boys. However, my brother-in-law, David, was one of the original founders of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother Billy played next year, as I recall, the Rugby site at highlandrugby.net, which deals with team history.) > At the time I was there, there was a club for about ten years and it has long since built a reputation for excellence. It is a fact that they have focused on "broad" topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little "gone" in my head, but I think maybe I was a little jealous. They were the hard core of the belief system that Gelwix promoted. As for the issues of "cultural mixing" that have been raised, it might be interesting to note that when I was there for 80 years, one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - South High School - and its the students were divided into three other primary SLC schools. To be honest, Highland was pretty white eighty years ago ... I have a team image of (I think) 1977 that shows an * all * white club. On the other hand, South High was a much more racially integrated school than it was closed: I had a few friends from the South who joined the team, one Tongan, one Samoan, and as I recall, there was a bunch of Island Nations players who joined '88 -'90. I don't think anyone would question the team's credibility in accepting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if one thing that would be obvious about these guys was that they walked. And as for the strength of the team compared to the best high school teams: yeah, it is true that the US-Rugby on average, when taken as a whole, is not particularly well against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it is a simple fact that Rugby has no significance or the exposure needed to develop the many traditions of excellence in the US that arise in other countries. It was said: Judge Highland on his merits: <br /> <br /> - the * only * team, which annually qualifies for the US Rugby Championship in the 25-year history of these organizations . <br /> <br /> - victory record 392 wins, 9 losses. Read it again ... the most successful coach of any American sport in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - Some convincing winnings against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe a few years, probably not the most ... but they are good at a good level. And it is disrespectful that the game is thrown away when Highland Rugby can be the best ambassador of the sport in the US.
