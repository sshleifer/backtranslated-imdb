My result of this film is a score of 8 is relative to other 1930 feature films. According to the standards of films made just a few years later, this film can only receive 6 or 7 points - mostly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it's possible that the movie sounded better and Fox Film Channel showed a degraded print (DID has a lot of lines and scratches), but I suppose the sound problem was always a problem. This is because the sound in the movies was still a novelty in the 1930s, and many of the 1930s Hollywood-speaking images sounded horrible - with background characters who often drowned, leading figures, figures huddled to make sure they were captured microphones or inconsistent quality (like what was seen in BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other movies of the day). All of this was much worse in BIG TRAIL because most of the movie was shot outside - something unheard of at the time. Completely new, but also something that really put the talents of the sound engineers! While the film was very hard to listen to, I realize they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive it - especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking - a major innovation for 1930. <br /> <br /> The story is more like CIMARRON - Western that came out next year and won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not such a great movie and I actually like BIG TRAIL more due to the scope of the film. While some may worry about the slow pace of BIG TRAIL, I saw it as a great history lesson about the difficulties of those traveling in the West by train. In addition, the whole thing looked so beautiful, as director Raoul Walsh went to major problems filming on the spot and The BIG TRAIL looks almost like a movie version of some Ansel Adams prints. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it was pretty good. It was a big break for young John Wayne - how his previous screen look was, at best, small and extraordinary. Here, he was given leadership and made dandy work - though he was apparently young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than he was in later movies, while his screen persona was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was Tyrone Power II (father of Tyrone Power). He looked like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like Bluto from Popeye's cartoon! He has made very few sound movies - he is dying only a year after making this film - so it is a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor. Overall, the film is worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few too long scenes here and there. It was a remarkable achievement for the 1930s - more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON of the following year. Much of the fact that BIG TRAIL didn't win an Oscar was probably because ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out in the same year and it's really one of the best movies.
