I thought it was a great event. Very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favorites next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after watching the new Tomb Raider movie. I thought, Charlie or Lara? Which would win in the fight ??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they kick their ass. I just hope to see Gene soon in another movie. It looks like it's too long. It would be especially nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. They're doing a great duo now. Watch this movie if you don't. You won't be disappointed.
