Dark and dreary sets, thrilling music that goes through your spin like aknife (or razor), the perfect cast that leads Broadway Hearn and Lansbury. This is an exciting theater flawlessly transferred to a small screen. Sondheim is the most talented composer of our time, and Todd is his masterpiece, from Brecht's opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale - "Little Priest," where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that end up in their meat pies. this game never ceases to excite, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn also stands out as Johanna, even she, because the ingenue game seems a little crazy. Edmund Lyndeck turns around in a show like a corrupt judge who longs for Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn command the show as only two great actor / stars can do. Other musical highlights include Todd's "Johann" Lovett's "Worst Cake in London" and Act II, which opens "BOH THATS GOOD", and that is the name that describes the production!
