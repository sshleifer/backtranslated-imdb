Slasher movies began to be 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me this among those pearls that will stay longer after they have turned on the TV. Especially if you are a man easy to worry about, it's a movie for you for which you shouldn't stomach to keep it full. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and excitement. No blood without gore, but excitement definitely cools your spine. the movie begins with a bang and remains the same at the end. BGM is a nervous crackle and I remember it was the one that was copied in many Indian movies. Most Popular Kings? No wonder why ... that's the only reason I wanted to see it and it didn't let me go. "Don't turn off the lights" ... which you're used to finding Enrique, but may be a smiling doll sitting right behind you! Attention. not for lite heart ... <br /> <br /> Two thumps up and I'm going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but I still keep my rating for Dramas ...
