A review that I have put aside too long .... Tupě, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films that have been to this day, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker's genius and this is one of his best works. And although many people are misunderstood or underestimated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I will have to agree. Nobody had done anything like that before in 1968, and nobody has ever since. It was a miracle of the special breakthrough effect at that time, and seeing how the effects are being held today is no wonder why. The film still looks amazing after forty years! Take note of CGI people. Using large thumbnails and realistic lighting, Kubrick has created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect in itself almost created the cool emptiness of the cosmic atmosphere, which is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another movie in which you couldn't do anything in the universe like it really is. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, but it is cleverly used as a mood-making tool and works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> There are other factors besides the spectacular display of ingenious special effects. that play a role in determining film feeling. The music played, all the classic, compliment what the eyes see, and make the sense of the person's way through his evolution from monkey to space traveler. The story, though seemingly simple, is deep. Several mysterious black monoliths are gradually discovered, and basically trigger certain events that are an integral part of the film. What are they? Where do they come from? What they do? These are all the questions a person asks to watch the story and is asked to find their own way. While most of them come up with a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, every individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way to decide to answer these questions results in deep solutions. It's not entirely left to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite frosty, regardless of your personal solution. Although it is a long film and sometimes slows down, it must be so that it accurately depicts the path of man. It's not a theme that fits well in a shorter movie, at a faster pace. Those with a short range of attention may not pay. Last but not least, the epitome of a ruthless antagonist, HAL 9000, is the computer. The machine never had such a cooling screen. Which reminds me that the film with such deep ambitions and executions is surprisingly small. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. All in all, one of the best films ever made and one of the best science fiction films. Personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
