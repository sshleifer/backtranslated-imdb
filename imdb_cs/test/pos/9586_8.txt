I always like to watch this cartoon when Sylvester tries to catch Tweety on the train rather than his grandmother's house. It's actually standard fare, but fun, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how bullied animators were with the train. When you watch it over and over again, just like my little boy (who loves trains, which is why he liked it a lot), you will notice some things. changing a luggage vehicle on a train, either 3rd, 4th or 5th, and long shots at all. The engine is either 651 or 814 or none at all. Coal offer has either 99 number or "S.P. & Q.R." on it, or no number or letters at all. Coaches carry "S.P.Q.R." without "&" in long shots, and then in the details it has the words "SouthEast and Western." All this is not contradictory to the story, but the production details were apparently not being looked at very carefully. This cartoon is still among my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
