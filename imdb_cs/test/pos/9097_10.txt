Just Go to See This Movie. The band plunges everything amazing on rock and roll, the band comes with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with Teancous D's humor is the best movie ever. Cameos are great right back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like Tim Robbins. You'll also find out who Satan is! Music and music links are cheerful and amazing. Playin songs great songs from The Who, Dio, and others just finish. I personally didn't think the band could win amazing D songs, but with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Really amazing music. Just go see it, it's for everyone who loves rock!
