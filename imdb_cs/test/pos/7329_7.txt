I was a little horrified to see the low ratings that this film received here, personally for the fun family fare. This revolves around a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by his mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with his uncle Porter. While there, he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. Lots of adventures take place amidst a predictable union nephew, as well as a little romance for Sandy with a local girl. I'm a great Crocodile Dundee fan myself, so I absolutely loved Paul Hogan in his role of cruel and comical Uncle Porter. To begin with, he keeps an endless supply of spaghetti-O in his house to serve as the usual food, heated by a burner! Elija Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, seemed quite capable of playing Young Sandy, the boy at first not very happy to help his forced summer vacation. Of course, the dolphin is amazing and there are wonderful underwater scenes. Set in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This Flipper adaptation is a great family fun, sweet, sentimental and entertaining movie that is now infinitely superior to many youth movie offerings.
