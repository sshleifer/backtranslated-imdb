Barbet Schroeder's "Murder by Numbers" starring Sandra Bullock is a solid job, though not particularly compelling. I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and he's effective as a forensic detective, Cassie Mayweather, who is not very likeable and also a broken person. But there is a sense of secession in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder done by two corrupt sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling), who is great, and Justin (Michael Pitt), who is a sympathetic geek. Essentially, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better at school night. They are very intelligent and very arrogant, which is usually not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's script does a great job of examining the mysterious murder in detail, and it's really by number. We have these two punk kids who boast their superiority, and we just want them to break up. This is not a great exploration into the dark side, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" about Claus von Bulow. There are interesting bends in "numbers". The film is not so much a thriller, but rather a character study of Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravery, her fear of getting her, and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to the suffering character. Her partner and kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a conspiracy than real character. Although Chaplin does a wonderful thing. Another nice touch is Richard and Justin's strange sexual attraction. The most interesting things about "numbers" are Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many fun twists in the movie. Everything is done very competently. I saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect I like it a bit more than I saw it. But it is not simply inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
