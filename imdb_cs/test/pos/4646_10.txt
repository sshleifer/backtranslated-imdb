This film is typical in the early 1980s, just like FUN !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was little and it was my favorite movie. Because it was a while ago, no one I ever met knew what it was. Then, probably at a time when my roommate said she saw it too, and that it was her favorite, they started printing it again! Luckily I have a copy now !! If someone wants to see the biggest (kitschy) hunter who was probably the beginning of the thought that this is a threat to the brothers, this movie is !!! (Watcher - must have a serious love for movies that are ugly 80's!)
