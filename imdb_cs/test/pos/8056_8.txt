After being raised as a child in Phenix City, I meet many local people in the film, so for me it is like taking a memorial trip again to see "The Phenix City Story". My grandfather is actually in one of the first scenes. Uncle Drew is the Hawaiian shirt who chooses a chair to look at the singer / stripper better. <br /> <br /> If you weren't there, just like Mr. Page and I both, you can't possibly understand the story he tells. A New York reviewer calls racist John Patterson, most likely without a meeting with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what's your point of raising Mr Patterson now? It has nothing to do with the film you are supposed to view. How in the world can you sit and judge either you or this movie when you probably haven't gone further south than the Bronx? It is my experience that the people who do it simply try to feel morally superior to the people depicted in the film. Most of the time, both Mr. Pattersons were basically good and decent men. Their families were decent people, just like most people who lived in Phenix City. By the way, why is it so hard for those living off the south to believe that there are good and decent people in the small towns of Alabama? And why do they believe that everyone living in a small southern city is a racist? My parents lived there, and they didn't tolerate it in our household. Others do not tolerate it, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives through the deliberate ignorance of others. The movie itself is simple and straightforward. It's not the whole story - Hollywood added some sensational meaning when the movie was made. Its parts were completely at the finish. Other parts border on fairy tales. And if it's a resource that someone uses to decide how people are in small southern cities, they need to grasp and understand what most of us do - it's just a movie.
