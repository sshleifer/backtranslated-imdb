I remember driving an inn with my parent and sister. I was in class 5, and still a kid, and the disc closed 4 years later, but the movie still persists in my memory. An adult movie that finds a child. This is a sign of perfection. Hoffman is one of the better Hollywood actors and this film proves it. I like the fact that Billy put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version I shot there. Remember, Joe Flairty is crying. Please email me if you like SCTV parody. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a story about a father and his son. I touch and care about the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets are changing. It's worth a second watch. 7/10
