Even bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and it's not bad! In fact, it's pretty fun. Actually, it's a fascinating study of trying to manipulate star personalities. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "good two shoe molds", she plays the actress of the German Spy / English Musical Hall. She subsequently continued to take her top in the film S.O.B. and play drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so good girls usually under her husband Blake Edward's direction. The film is undoubtedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she is a German Spy. We want to love Julie, but he's on the wrong side of the law. This is probably why this film fell. Julie as a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? Romance seems to take place overnight and comes from nowhere. But it doesn't matter, it's a musical and it has Jullie. Yeah and I mentioned hunky Rock Hudson's in it too? Julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that no musical comedy buff should miss. Great WW 1 Songs and nice melodies from Mancini. Yes, the movie has holes and sometimes doesn't seem logical. For example, why is Julie and her uncle suddenly being persecuted by the Germans when she spied on them a while ago. But on another note, who cares? Music numbers are fun and exciting. Costumes and scenery are extremely rich. Cinematography quite on the mark. He has annoying idiotic detectives Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawning) But Julie is desperate to change her image. (You can imagine a dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake must change our image." Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, then we'll take our clothes in another movie and then play a transvestite in another the film, they won't recognize you, it will be the death of Maria Von Trapp "<br /> <br /> Fascinating study of image change. Wonderful Julie. Music comedy lovers, much more fun than Star!
