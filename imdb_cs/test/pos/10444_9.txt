As I said in another note it's one of the best teen movies of all time, and one of my personal favorites. For me, this film is the second best teen movie ever. second only to the breakfast club. The latest American virgin is also perhaps the most honest teen movie of all time. it is an underestimated and largely unknown film for many people. coming to TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. the first half of this movie is comedy sex with some honest scenes. then the other half is honest and mostly serious. with only a few comic scenes. In my opinion, this is the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard many great songs in one movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie that I think are some of the best love songs in history. the film is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school, which has a few best friends. His two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the film is largely a sexual disaster. which are very funny. Gary is chief in love with a new girl at school. He later finds out that his best friend goes with her. He also scams on the side. You can feel the love of Gary's power for this girl. you can feel it even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be creeping. But his other friend is pretty cool. The film shows how people can be. You can cover many of this movie. The plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. But it is much more. it is a very honest movie. It is also a very 80ish that I love. If you like the 1980s or grew up in the 1980s, rent this movie. but there may be some people who don't like the 1980s, but he may like this movie. I first saw this movie in 1987 I think. it's very fun and very funny. it combines very moving moments with very fun moments. it's an underestimated gem! I have a movie. I love it! i give the last american virgin *** 1/2 of ****
