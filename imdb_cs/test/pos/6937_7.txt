"You can't take it realistically." -sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world in itself. I've never seen anything like this. All I can think of comparing with psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√©? I simply do not think that it is incoherent and absurd, although it is sometimes. I mean, it'll do you with a broad spectrum of intense experience and unexpected emotions so fast that they overwhelm you, and when they're done you'll find it all happened when you were sitting on the couch. It is worth noting that it is an extremely low budget, as a statement for those who, after watching "Shaun of the Dead" consider themselves to be fans of underground zombie movies. Also note that it is much more "brutal" than you would expect. Children get embarrassed and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin. Her corpse is subsequently "raped". Certainly there are no shortcomings, and I really feel like it's a film credit. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie, don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I don't intend to dump it in terms of brutality. Inside "or something." Even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is one classic horror scene and something totally original. br /> <br /> Man, I have three paragraphs and I barely said anything here. Here's why I thought the movie was amazing: 1. It's big and still moving. it turns into another NotLD clone, a movie aboard, where everyone stays on the farm and will argue with each other, but until the end of the film, scenes from the farm will seem like a distant dream, and there are many outdoor, urban scenes. with a low budget. <br /> <br /> 2. Make-up / gore is much better than ZB1 More convincing and creative Something funny: morning zombies look really lame, then, in the middle, suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and all of them as a Zombie Fulci, some remind Mr. Tongue of "The Day of the Dead." And there's a big scene of dozens of zombies mixing up. He never gets old. 3. There is something oddly emotional about it. One character claims that heaven exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it to be true. Although the characters behave with the typical horror of horror film, they seem to care for themselves and that's why I took care of them. <br /> <br /> 4. Stimulation is great. Hardly a boring moment. My only observation, which borders on criticism, is that Todd Sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. I personally feel that it adds to the experience, but I don't think it does it intentionally, so I can't give the film a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner screams at the passengers. Then he says something that would result in: "I'm sorry I yelled at you. Straight shaver when you are five years old." Wtf? More than I can handle.Includes a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some preachy end credits explain the metaphor of zombies. Indeed, at this point, I firmly re-live my drug experience. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend. .
