Indeed, this movie should be released on DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think is a studio movie and I was absolutely pleased !!! It was on my list of movies that I only owned for the cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both were in Romeo and Juliet, and John Gielghud. I'm sorry about the wrong spelling, I was there by myself, I thought it would be okay for the small amount I spent. The boy was right. I won't give any of this one, maybe you already know the story, but I'll tell you if you can make a copy in any format .... JPC
