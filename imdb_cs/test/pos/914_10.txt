Irene Jacob is fascinating in this final installment of the Krzysztof Kieslowski trilogy, and the story is endlessly satisfying, as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I'm just astonished at the amount of talent that took me to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit exactly together, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently made and the end result much larger than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs to any list of great movie achievements. Simply brilliant!
