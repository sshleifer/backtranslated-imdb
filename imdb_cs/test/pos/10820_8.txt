I think the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well. She has a very authentic feeling for this time. I don't know if it was computer magic or if it was real. Some of the great scenes have hundreds of accessories in the background. I was especially interested in the scene of this bridge. The main character, who the actress also played well, showed us a nervous, funny woman who knows how to confide in men to get what she wants. some scenes were merry. Although it was about 2 hours but it was never boring. very good funny movie.
