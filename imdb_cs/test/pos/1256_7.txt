The Kid - At the age of 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men envy - he has a great job, is respected (and afraid), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a price, in this case no social life, no conscience and no fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. As I watched the movie, I was still wondering why Disney didn't pass this Miramax movie - not because it's bold or nervous, but because it is definitely an adult movie. It is further enhanced by a marketing campaign that is clearly aimed at children - it is centered on trailers for "Rugrats the Movie", and "Pokemon 2000" (not passe yet?). But I guessed. I was impressed with the sensitive subject - rather than the typical male middle-aged crisis that includes some pathetic sap that bought a Porsche convertible and behaves like a moron. some serious introspection and takes into account his life. His guide on this journey of self-knowledge is alone at the age of 8 (they never explain how Rusty comes and, frankly, I didn't care). Young Rusty's innocence and unfettered optimism give him a distinct advantage in divination of truth - summing up Russell's work as a picture consultant by "teaching people how to lie and pretending to be something they are not". However, in order for a good script to succeed, you need actors to revive it. There is no problem. Although Willis ignored W.C three times. Field warnings about how they play with children or animals are once again pleasing, as is Breslin's comedy. Willis manages to balance the features of Russell's cruel powerbroker with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous. Meanwhile, Breslin puts the dead in the picture of a childhood kid of everyone - the one who has always stuck and got on him for some reason. We also get two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is great because Russell's assistant and Jean Smart are perfect as a keen magician (I loved her in Guinevere). The kid is charming, heavy, and real. And appeal to adults of all ages.
