Bounty murderer George Hilton, a smooth Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who is great), and bank representative Edd Byrnes each try to outwit each other while looking for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's robbery, which was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang. Although not the biggest that the genre has to offer, it is still pretty fresh with many cheerful, action-packed and satisfying finals. Any Gun Can Play is mainly remembered to be the opening gag where George Hilton can easily shoot down three outlaws reminiscent of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. Next year, Hilton and Roland met Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski in the highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
