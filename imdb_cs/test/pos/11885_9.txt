My young aunt is unique in many ways. The first is the first action movie of Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). The second She actually did battle scenes after she had surgery for her a few days before filming. The third of this film is out of chain. The film begins with Wang Lung Wei, who tries to take her inheritance from her brother. His brother has Kara to marry him, so Wang can't take the treasure. The story is pretty good, leading everything to its rightful place. In what can be said, it has not yet been said for films like this, or the disciples of the 36th Chamber, the Victim, or even the Magnificent Butcher. Fighting scenes are what a movie sale, and it won't have any problem doing so. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei have taken part in the fight you have to believe. Why are these two men not fighting each other out of me. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything, but you have to see your young aunt to get full excitement. My only gripe is that Yuen So wasn't used as widely as it was used in 3 Evil Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) to excellent to see movies. 9.2 / 10
