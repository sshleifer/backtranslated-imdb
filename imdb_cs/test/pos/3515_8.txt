I didn't have much expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I still buy these slasher movies when I know it's always the same. Maybe I'm a little masochistic? By the way, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, he has nothing original. Yes, it's about a small group of teenagers walking in the woods to camp, drinking and having sex. Yes, one by one maniac kills them. And you know what? It's just magic! It's one of the best experiences I've watched the movie slasher. The places where he is shot are so amazing. You see mountains, waterfalls, rocks. It's just amazing. It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer begins to kill, but I didn't care! It was nice to watch enough not to care. I mean, you're not going to sit there waiting for murders to begin because every thing that happens is a pleasure thanks to the beauty of the film itself. The end is a little weird, but I'm not going to tell you anything. You'll know what I mean. Another thing I enjoyed: you care for characters. They are not just a bunch of blasters who spend their time biting. Sure, they're pure stereotypes of the usual slasher characters, but there's something special about them. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you look at it because I really did!
