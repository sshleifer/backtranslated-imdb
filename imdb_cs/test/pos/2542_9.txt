Gray can jump English like hoops like no one else. He recounts a number of events, tied by his manuscript writing ("Monster" title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. If you like "swimming to Cambodia," you'll love this. Actually, I thought it was a little more interesting and better to say, "Swimming to Cambodia". A real masterpiece.
