OK. So it can be done! We have a perfect vampire film. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. Realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Notice - I'm from Transylvania and I assure you, this film respects the vampire tradition! It's just like the stories I heard in my childhood. For Transylvanian, it's quite ... credible. You have to see this if you are interested in real vampires, how they were portrayed in medieval chronicles and not how they do in recent Hollywood movies (if I guess, Hollywood's problem is that they mix vampires with an incubator - Vampires are never very nice or attractive they can only inspire the horror and repulsion of the Incubus - called in my country The Night Flier, is one beautiful demon who kills his victims by loving them, I recommend it for all gothic people out there! Of course, do not miss DArk shadows! Something similar is Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski.
