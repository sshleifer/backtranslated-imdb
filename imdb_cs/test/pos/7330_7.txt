I like this movie. I can be biased because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years. The old one will sit and watch the whole movie .... It's not Oscar material, but definitely entertaining. Dolphin cinematography is well done with the beautiful background of ocean scenery and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper "flips" pop out of the water that hit Sandy in the head. It's an exciting funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the cumbersome joking of the rogue (forgetting his name) is a little hard to accept. A shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins really make so much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing? Bottom line: my kids like it and keeps recycling through our VCR.
