I've never heard of this movie and got it just because I'm a Martin Sheen fan. Now I'm amazed why he didn't get the praise and appreciation he really deserves. All four of the characters force you to feel them, your father is trying to enforce his authority, his mother is still holding traditional family values, and both are trying to keep their appearances in spite of their family's complete fragmentation, a daughter who wants her own life and her son. haunts his experience in Vietnam. One felt that it was a scenario that had to be played by thousands of "ordinary" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was great - totally upset by his war experience, which no one of his family could have been. The screen chemistry between him and his real father Martin Sheen was amazing. There were times when Emilia's anxious face was so similar to Martin's "Apocalypse Now". I'm sure, like Martin, Apocalype counted as one of his best movies, Emilio would consider it one of the best. The scene with the gun was absolutely stunning because all the emotions were on the faces of the family. Brilliant playing of Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I saw the film for the first time at night - and today is the main story in a report about the Gulf War veteran who shot several members of his family. How many other young men will life have destroyed by war?
