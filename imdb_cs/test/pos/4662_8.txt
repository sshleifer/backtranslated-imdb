Well, I just discovered an IMDb from my twins Carol. Carol and I played "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We didn't have much to prepare for the fat part that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first major film role and we did it. At that time we had 21 and lived about an hour and a half from Disney Studio in Burbank and California in Hollywood. We grew up in front of the television and probably was the first generation of baby sprouts. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and are still "heavy" or politically correct these days. We are no longer trying to act, but we knew we would be back when the right opportunity came. Carol is a chiropractor in our Southern California home town and I am in the IT field in Georgia. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm impressed, but I thought the movie was cute, clean and fun. We knew it wasn't a masterpiece or an Oscar nomination, but it was and still is a movie that the whole family can watch and have fun together. It's nice that you don't have to worry that your little kids can watch the video without having to fast forward some parts. And no one was more abandoned when he was released on video like Carol and I was. Carol found out in Kmart for $ 6.99! Now it's a cheap way to capture your memories and share them with others. Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; Thompson Twins
