Fantastic musical with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. Own a nightclub where they dance. He's not a star yet, but when he chooses Vanity's cover girl, whose owner was in love with her grandmother, she gets a big break. When he sees the similarities, he immediately takes it to a match where his maganzine runs. Hayworth's newly found fame on the first episode wonders for Kelly's club, but her star rises so fast and so high that his catch begins to tremble. This is not the most original plot, but both wires really work. It also helps that the script is great. Kelly is not yet at his peak, especially his peak as an actor. But his dance wow. Hayworth is a star, but Kelly claims the film is the most memorable moment when she is passionately dancing with her own reflection. It is of course the launch of Fred Astaire's shadow in Swing Time, but I think Kelly will do that, which is hardly believable. In fact, it must be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, perhaps even a few years later, and the American Final in Paris. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the music numbers are even better. Too bad Rita didn't sing her own songs (well, maybe she has a few of them because her singing voice was sometimes different). Her dance is amazing, just like the rest of the acting. It's hard not to love her in anything. It's really one of the few beautiful women of the classical era. Not plastic like many of them; No, you can really see the warmth in this woman. Her smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend and is also very fun. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers Trio is probably the core that became Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor in Singin's Rain for the eighth year. One of the greatest music numbers in the film seems to be almost completely stolen with the number "Good Morning" in Singin. I think Singin 'in the rain is a better movie because Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges. But this roughness only adds to the spell. There are aspects of this movie that beat Singin 'in the rain, and even the American in Paris. For example, a central relationship is more emotionally involving. Instead of a dominant older man chasing a little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers), we have a very nice relationship with two people who look more like equals. There is no chase around - an aspect that unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a bit sour, you have to admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a few from the beginning, and when it starts to tremble, I really felt it. 9/10.
