The whole abbreviation for the allegedly more aware in this strange time is that you are "Blue". Blue State mentality. It is believed that we do this from what is happening over the past few years in our country (USA). It will not allow anyone, but we feel better as if we in no way benefit from living here and getting all the good things a US citizen only gets by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of biting it. It doesn't do anything good. I haven't done many actions lately and I wonder how many people they have. Maybe I'm just because my work was "outsourced" last month and now I'm looking for a job in reducing technical support where most jobs go to India and other places abroad. I am thinking that soon it will not pay to be a citizen here with broken infrastructure and shrinking labor market and obsession with war. These days it seems that everyone who speaks gets jumps and challenges "patriotism" there. By the way, back to this review: USA The film is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, be it politics, protest or art or media. Of course, the creator is passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go out of the norm, frustrated, unique, clever, etc. <br /> <br /> I have viewed the entire web that is linked to DVD and lost in all articles, essays, etc. there are. The DVD also does, has links to different times, views, and historical points. Sometimes somebody does something.
