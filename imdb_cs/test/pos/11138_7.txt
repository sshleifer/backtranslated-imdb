I was surprised to see it on TV on Friday and I liked it. Between the presence of Bobbie Phillips and numerous references to everything that could be considered "cyberpunk", it was a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed the story that reminded me of the book I read ("Earth", David Brin), and I was glad to see it on TV. Bobbie looks great, but I also enjoyed her performance as Kam because she seemed different from the others. But the biggest thing about this movie was the atmosphere that was described in Gibson, Sterling and others. It was fun to see it on TV.
