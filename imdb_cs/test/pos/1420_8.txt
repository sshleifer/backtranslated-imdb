A brief history of time is not just the beginning and the end of universal and reality as we know it, it's a story about man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is his story that reflects the story of time and change in the history of the universe. The style of the documentary / editorial style of conversations begins and ends with a fast fade to black. A documentary, almost like a blink between segments and interviews, gives you a strange feeling like looking at Stephen Hawking and not at the camera eye. Running time is just a little longer than an hour. It's a short story, then it can be talked about for a few days and days. An interesting and proud story.
