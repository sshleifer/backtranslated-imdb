I have seen this wonderful classic again after many years, alongside the latest film by director Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 (at the same time that male star Larry Harvey also died in 1950). 1973). Three future directors were in the crew: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (cinematographer) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story "Goodbye Berlin" by the famous British author Christopher Isherwood, who first turned into a play by John van Druten, then made into this film, then from the musical "Cabaret". , and eventually filmed as 'Cabaret', which brought the amazing Liza Minelli to the world of attention, with her voice that can break the glass at a mile distance. Isherwood appears in the film as a character under his own name. He was homosexual, but in those days that were illegal and could land him in prison, he disguised his inclinations under the description of what he called "confirmed young man". This is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, mad, promiscuous, always cheerful and thoroughly unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour-de-force by young Julie Harris who sweeps every scene into a magical and captivating web of sparkling personal charm. What vehicle for an actress with great charm! It is one of the greatest film performances of the 1950s. Isherwood played to perfection a young Lawrence Harvey, in a finely-judged performance that never allows comedy to go over the edge, and even while farce bordering on a slapstick remains somehow 'almost believable'. Larry is so humorous that he portrays a wimpish hypochondriac. What is irony, given the sheer lack of hypochondria that manifested in his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life when he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaints. In the last three years I knew him well and was a generous, warm and humble man. He idolized his little girl Domino, now unfortunately also tragically dead. This film was his best early performance, which is to follow his magnificent works in 'Room Up' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Manchurian Candidate' (1962). Larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too handsome, was often cast as cad, and glamor boys aren't always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses played against him, and they were in no doubt about his abilities t, and he was a strong leader in many of the most important films of his time. If he lived above middle age, he would go from strength to strength and become the "old man" of the screen. One day he sat in his house in Hampstead and gave me a glass of usual white wine from a huge barrel he had brought from some strange cellar. I said he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? He proudly replied that it was Sancerre, who had chosen himself in a vineyard in France and transported it specially. Then he added with extreme anger: "You know, I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on him and ask me what it is, and you are the first person to do so." \ T for having a taste for wine, and his charming friends denied him that satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring gives a moving early performance as a serious young man (later he was to have to play Nazi officers too much, a poor guy), and young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl, in her usual noisy but effective way, but it wasn't too hard because she was a noisy Jewish girl herself. This film is so happy about it that it's pure joy.
