Yeah ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat," (which is amazing reading by the way), and DLR says it was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a child. In fact, he says he always imagined himself as a black man in Southern Cal. Mr. Roth is quoted as: <br /> <br /> "We've seen every picture of Blacksploitation and these movies have had a huge impact on me. Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore Doin 'trouble Dolemite-I saw all those ... "<br /> <br /> He goes on to say: <br /> <br />" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals. It was a blue comic, made blue humor, like Redd Foxx for the first party, so it was best to play a new secret agent, James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, Mother *****! "We'd wait for this line in all his movies." Get Whitey " would appear in any movie at least once, and we'll be waiting for They had cars, they had shoes, they had guns, hairdressers, slangs and scams and we all knew that all these condescending talk at the end of the movie were white bulls *** Trying to feed hungry kids, but he's actually a chick ... Taurus **** It was designed to be about our tasty mothers and dads to let us go to the picture. "<br /> <br /> He speaks like a true genius. So when reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book, I immediately bought it on DVD and I really like it. Yeah, it's a super low budget, and yeah ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino movies, I see many similarities, especially some of the 70's fusion / funky ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the movie. I also love the scene where two cops "bust" him for coke and then one of them snorts the whole pile like he did a thousand times before, and says something like, "Aww yeah ... that's a real mccoy! "... and then he still talks and has a little coke on his lip." CLASSICAL! Some of the violence is somewhat above the limit, but shocking, which I would consider a positive quality. Not as predictable as I expected. Certainly soon "The Human Tornado" will pick up. 10 of 10.
