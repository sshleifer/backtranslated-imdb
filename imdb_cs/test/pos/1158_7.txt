It is a perfectly traceable adventure movie that you can watch, with a great cast and a good story based on real events. It is interesting to note that the story of the film is based on real events. It is mainly an adventure story for most of the time, with all the usual ingredients you would expect from adventurous movies in the Arab world. So a lot of sword fighting, good old-fashioned honor, religion and a rich proud country. However, the film is also filled with humor so that the film becomes light and pleasant to watch. Continuous shearing between a Moroccan plot including Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line. In my opinion, Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach. These two things have completely different steps, totally different characters, they're just completely different worlds! Of course, both storylines are linked and focused on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big for it to work. Throughout the film, the film does not feel connected and slightly discontinuous. The American conspiracy line is more political in most of the time, while the Moroccan conspiracy line is purely adventurous and fulfilled. Eventually you might wonder what it was for the whole movie or Roosevelt. John Milius seems to be his great admirer. Often the American plot line would carry most of the pace from a more interesting and more action-packed fast Morrocan line. After all, John Milius has always been in the best position as an action director. It is not until the middle of the movie that the pair gets full. The biggest and most extensive action of the film then starts digging. Especially the great battle of the end will not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like that. In this way, this film would also be known one, no doubt. The movie has a great Jerry Goldsmith music score, which is perhaps better known than the actual movie itself. The film is also good-looking, with great production design and nice action and battle sequences. The movie only costs $ 4,000,000 to do, but it is really hard to believe, considering the setting and size of the movie. I think John Milius is his best known movie, "Conan Barbarian", which costs about $ 20,000,000, but is much more campy looking one and less impressive in its scale. Pretty funny to see the Arabic language a big fat Scottish accent, but hey, it's Sean Connery, so you just want to accept it. It suits his role well. So did Candice Bergen. It is always difficult for a female character to meet as a credible and to work in a movie like this, but she does. John Huston also plays a big part in this movie! <br /> <br /> Perfect movie! <br/> 7/10
