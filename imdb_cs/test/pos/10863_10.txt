Dropping Velvet was released in the UK three weeks ago and I watch countless letters flooding national documents and TV guides, claiming to have a thin graph, poor performance and even weaker scenario. You'll find I'm upset. This is heresy. I really would like to dispel all the doubts by first congratulating Andrew Davies on allowing Geoffrey Sax to create this amazing dramatization of Sarah Waters' novel by alleviating it with such a fantastic scenario. Glory. But I'm afraid I have to change direction now. I saw one of the premier TV guides here in the UK (which remains unnamed) that tirelessly describes Tipping the Velvet as a "story of lesbian love". If they are, and I assume they are, trying to promote interest in the film, then this is a completely wrong way to go about it (except the phrase that is disappointing inaccurate description). By saying such a thing, they are either: a) averting those who instinctively repel "that" object, or b) attracting a class of people who will only follow a "serious girl to a girl." Buy Video! Through this depiction of serious distrust, this and other magazines make it cheaper to adapt to one of the greatest literary works. Velvet tipping is a story of love, passion, movement, loss and heartbreak. It's not a lesbian love story. No siree. <br /> <br /> The end result is a stylish performance with outstanding performance all the time (especially from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). Direction-wise, it's intoxicating and immersive - sometimes, fast-paced, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling. As a whole, it is polished and well delivered, sex is done with tenderness and gentleness - and although many of them will not sort out as a real "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time to come.
