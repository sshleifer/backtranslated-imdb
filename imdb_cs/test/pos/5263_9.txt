Most of the comments have nailed this to the head. Viewers under "certain age" and IQ with three digits should avoid "chance for a lifetime" such as George W. Bush appointed to face BBQ Congress. their way around a well-written script. Is this assumption wildly original? No, but the film stands out as a beacon at midnight in the current and endless excess of movies / television focusing on the most desirable demographic groups of teenagers and young people <br /> <br />. Betty White and Leslie Neilsen in the lead, the cast also has always reliable veterans like Elaine Stritch and William Windom. The sharp dialog box is effortlessly and efficiently delivered by these professionals. "Chance for Life" is definitely not a film for Will Ferrell / Adam Sandler / "Saw" slasher gore-fests, "American Eye Blunt," and ninety percent of the rest of Hollywood and TV sludge.
