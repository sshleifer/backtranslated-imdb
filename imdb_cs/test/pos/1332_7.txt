Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could conjure up could beat the amazing cast he won for this zenith sequel. Apparently he knew it out of the way. The term "star-vehicle" has traditionally been referred to by a film that builds itself around one star. What this film does is clean the entire herd of Hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than ever. The last scene says everything - all the stars that are around, with nothing is happening and nothing is said. We just meet them as if it were a reality show scene where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle are just hanging out and alone. So the story is not at all important - at least it is not the place where the greatest pleasure of movies comes from. If you want a smarter heist movie, stick to 11. But if a star watches you, it will be your day.
