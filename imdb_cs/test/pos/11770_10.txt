This is an amazing movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First, the cast is excellent. Not only does he have contemporary stars like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but also your stars from ancient times as Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous portraits of actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was also good. It was interesting to see how they made a plot for a stoner movie and almost made it dramatic. It takes a drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving him a comedic face like "Half Baked," he has a true picture of a life lesson like "Traffic." So watch this movie if you're a stoner giving you insight into something you love if you don't do drugs to give you a more realistic look at drugs than every party wants you to see.
