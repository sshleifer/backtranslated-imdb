In "The Squire of Gothos", Kirk and his crew meet with the powerful super-being that holds the Captain, "Bones" and several crew members captured for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think it's the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen and a program that made me starve for more. It's not one of the best episodes, but the rock-solid assumption of an extraterrestrial being that puts the Enterprise crew in the corner is a situation that makes the show so fun. In a way, a super-humanoid expects one of the most famous Star Trek characters, the mysterious "Q" Next Generation. This episode is also unforgettable for creating a unique situation: it's the first time Uhura is part of the event and the story allows the viewer to see what cute Uhuara character can be when the story allows her. Too bad the show never fully explored this iconic character.
