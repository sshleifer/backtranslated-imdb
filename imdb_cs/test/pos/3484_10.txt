This movie was so real. Actually, I felt all the emotions I saw here during my life at different times - Rory and Michael. I have Duchenne muscular dystrophy like Rory, so what you see is exactly what I actually felt. Some will not believe that people with disabilities are like Rory, full of rage and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them. The story is great. For drama, character-driven film, the story moves fast. I have never been bored, maybe partly because I have seen things that are close to me. But I think most people with intelligence will be stuck on the screen and take care of the characters. Acting is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect as Rory O'Shea, who has Duchen's muscular dystrophy. Steven Robertson deserves awards for his portrayal as Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. Michael's love does not return to the girl and Rory helps him deal with her. I felt it many times and the question is, "Does he not love me because I'm not the only one, or because my disability has turned it off?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical of the truth. It's just natural and it hurts one way or another. A few parts made me cry a bit because it's sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without terminal disabilities simply cannot understand how it can feel. This is a movie that everyone must see. Disabled people are everywhere and are very poorly understood. This film brings some light to some of the facts of life that are so proficient. We want to be just like you - living on our own terms, going out, getting drunk, loving. On the outside we can't do much, but inside, we dance!
