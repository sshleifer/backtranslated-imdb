I admit I didn't know about the existence of this movie until I saw him advertise on a cable outlet. I was very impressed with the Romanesque structure of the film. The film, which is in a language that I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance. I think it's talking about film quality. It was visually stunning. The meeting was visually breathtaking. The Chinese theatrical traditions of the movement, which serve to strengthen dialogue, are so convincing after watching Western film where actors have traditionally more focused on dialogue. The action in this movie comes directly to you, without a lot of blasts to catch you. It is human behavior that is so sensitive here. The added advantage that the film taught me the history of one of the world's largest tourist attractions, the funeral clay army of China's first Chinese emperor, was very impressive. The film seemed to have international significance beyond the great ethical themes of the film. It is a movie that I can comfortably recommend to a wide range of friends and acquaintances.
