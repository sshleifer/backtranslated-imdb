Someone certainly has it for The Wind and I can't believe that what I saw on the screen has a lot to do with it. This is a better and more solid film than most of the independent people I watch throughout the year. Cinematography shows true love and mastery of craft and casting was fine. I'd like to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. As for the story and the script, I'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intention of informing someone else about the film. Long pulled out thread-picky bashing spots that had to take hours to compose and are the only comments ever left for a film at this point by a reviewer, there are obvious rumors aimed at movie producers. I don't know the inner story, but it would probably be a good movie. What I know is around this biz is that production that tries to make everyone happy usually ends up awful and when a filmmaker has the courage to drive and common sense to "kill children", someone always ends up with feelings of injury. This is also part of the bizu and one of the best teaching tools available to those who really do film. Of course, failures do not have anything better than sitting at home and writing fake reviews on the internet as a form of vendetta against those who took them (read: they were honest and true). And this is my best guess to explain ugly, ugly reviews. It is worth mentioning how there is a grain of truth behind all this, but this exaggeration of grains is so high that they are obviously fictitious. It's not a slasher blood bath, if that's what you're looking for, it's rather a psychological thriller thriller that usually isn't valued by the lowest common denominators out there. The best way to see this movie is to try to eradicate all pre-conceived ideas, write them out and let them unfold - seriously, characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people are doing and what they say, I don't think that you may come up with the fact that these characters were poorly developed. Perhaps misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that this is a pretty done, compelling movie. Maybe I wouldn't normally give it 9, but serious negative comments really attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love for a really bad movie). For me, ratings below 5 should be reserved for rotten, awkward, poorly-kept and silly-written films. None of this is concerned here - it is a quality film making with some real talent. I gave it to nine to get the weight back. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
