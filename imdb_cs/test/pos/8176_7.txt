The story of pre-united China must be popular. Jet Li's Hero made the assassination of the king's popular. This is another story made several years ago. It is incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as a king's lover who was sent to recruit a killer so the king could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. Regardless of being unable to complete the mission as King knew of it in advance. I assumed he knew, but he went the same way. It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and, of course, another chance to see Li Gong.
