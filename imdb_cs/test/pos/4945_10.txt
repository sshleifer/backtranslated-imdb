Soul Calibur is stronger than ever ... with the new character creation and bad chronicle of the sword mode at home. <br /> <br /> The Arcade version is more complete, although the character list is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely the nicest of the two, eliminating all the "goofy / unrealistic" fighting styles found in the home version. If you were by no means disappointed with the home version, or perhaps thought it was "too much", you could find a much more sympathetic and straightforward Soul Calibur game in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a Legend?
