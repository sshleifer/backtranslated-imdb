Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> The film adaptation of Luchin Visconti from Thomas Mann's novel is visually, if not philosophically, true to its source (Britten's opera offers more faithful reading of Apollo / Dionysian struggles consuming aging writers). It is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made. <br /> <br /> In Visconti, the focus is on the physical aspects of the story. Venice never looked more beautiful and seductive, decadent and more effective. If you read the amendment, it's like having descriptions on her site come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives excellent performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he expresses bitterness, excitement and, finally, a pitiful desire for Aschenbach. Bjorn Andresen, a young actor who plays Tadzio, a beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was perfectly cast. He also plays a role with facial expressions and gestures. The character of Tadzio is central to the story, so every actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passions and desires. Visconti, with his incredible glance at beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And by changing Ashenbach from writer to composer based on Gustav Mahler and then using Mahler's music, especially Adagietta from the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant move. Although I have read Mann's story before the film, Mahler's music and Death in Venice will always be inseparably linked in my mind. Just like the scary images that appear throughout the movie, especially the last of Ashenbach, who dies on the beach when Tadzio walks slowly into the sea. One day, this movie will be released in the widescreen DVD format, and its visual splendor has been completely restored.
