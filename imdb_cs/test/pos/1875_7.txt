It's been a long time since someone made such a movie. The so-called B film. Maybe it wasn't a great movie, but it's fun to watch, classic Bruce Cambell, has good parts, funny, disgusting, even artistic. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> Part where his wife as a dummy-robot-avenger is going to die I don't know about you, but I felt so strange, so sad and disgusted. I compare this scene with the Fly 2 scene where his dog dies as a monster. You think you're my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------------------------- -------- ------------------ ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------ <br /> <br /> ******** No More Spoilers ******* ** <br /> <br /> If you are a Bruce Cambell fan, you definitely want to have this movie in your collection. If you are generally interested in movies, you may want to. Just think that the goal of the movie is to make you smile, you scared it (don't worry, not so bad) and take a good time with your friends. Attention, I told my friends, not a possible future girlfriend.
