"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an amazingly beautiful story about teenage boys and girls dealing with the state of becoming one. This film is not about homosexuality, but it's about sexuality. Aihara, the aloof girl, will surely think about who's behind the aloof girl. Does he love Yoshida? Or does he love Ito? Or did she somehow become a lesbian because of an "incident"? (I doubt it). And what about Yoshida? Does he realize he finally loves Ito? We all know that he loves him as a friend. But you will never know once you see this movie ... haha ​​:) Finally Aihara (along with Ito) gives the viewer an exceptional message: that is, it doesn't matter if you love a boy or girl. And I have to tell you, I'm so dense that I didn't get it first. ^ ;; It's because it's not a scene ... You have to try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions and not what they say (especially the last part ... damn it, boy, that was confusing!) confusing story, but it's beautiful. :) This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot).
