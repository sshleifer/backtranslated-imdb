I love this movie. There's something for everyone. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. A mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but wants to be a part of. I have to admit, I'm a little biased, because Colin Firth is my favorite actor, so nothing she does is bad in my eyes (!), But in this movie, his great acting talent is obvious and it's even more supported by beautiful gaming his teammate Nia Long. The problems with their love relationship make him, ironically, more believable and simple, such as the contrast between Matthew's and Nimi's clothes, making this a charming film. I reject someone who can't move this story. I find it charming and I've been watching it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
