I was just watching the movie and I must say that I was surprised. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan, in adolescent love. <br /> <br /> The look and feel is very different from many movies and you can easily get into the movie. There seems to be a lot of emphasis in the story itself, which is very subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit more complicated. But the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you in. Of course, the main draw is the one who likes something simple. It's not here. You must be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the film. But I enjoyed this movie. It's worth watching.
