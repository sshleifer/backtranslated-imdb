In the 1960s and 1970s, David Jason was renowned for his many support roles in television comedies, such as "Don't Check Your Set!", "Hark At Barker" and "Doctor". It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role, London's 'Top Secret Life Edgar Briggs' television, wrote Richard Laing & Bernard McKenna. Edgar Briggs is the secret "SIS" agent ("secret intelligence"). He really tries to do his job well, but he always seems to break things. Surprisingly, however, he always gets to the bottom of the cases, which is a lot to the amazement of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (beautiful Elisabeth Counsell), all that answers 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman). Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell), a woman who, like Michele Dotrice 'Betty' from 'Some Mothers' 'Ave' Em! ', He has the patience of a saint and stands by his hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like 'some mothers' to' Ave 'em' and 'Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was completely attached to the slapstick. Each episode saw Jason performing stunts such as falling from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his apartment. It was really a "custard cake in the face". 'Edgar Briggs' wasn't a big hit because of bad planning from I.T.V. Too bad because it was a fun and entertaining show, its star and fine support served well. The lead man, however, seemed to have missed the show. David Jason vetoed repeated screenings of the show because he felt his playing in it was non-refined. It is true that David Jason, who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin', is different from the one played by Briggs, but by no means was his performance imperfect. Most actors would turn Briggs into a ridiculous cartoon, but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible, realistic character. Indirectly possible, but not unimaginable. Jason's next vehicle was "Lucky Feller," in which he played 'Shorty Mempstead'. It also failed to make an assessment. His happy break came in the shape of "Sharp Intake Of Breath" by A.T.V, in which he played the "Peter Barnes" walk for four series in 1977-1981. "Briggs" is extraordinary, but it's an easy and useful watch. Nice "James Bond" melody!
