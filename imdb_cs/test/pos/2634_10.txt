Chris Penn is jolly like Jeff Spicoli's ordinary stoner brother. This movie is great because it was much more real and fun than fast times on ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van shirts, which became ou812 songs and illegal physical knowledge. This film is one of the great stoner movie heroes with cheerful and chong. Fast times were more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating friends, jerking in the bathrooms, bad jobs and failed school. Someone must hate the 1980s to enjoy ridgemont more than wild life. The film even had great portraits, such as the creator of Michelle's city borders in the alcohol store, or Ben Stein in his first role in a sunny surplus.
