Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that can stand alone. Dexter, sometimes a college student prone to disaster, has an idea for a wording that would make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than overwhelmed and hopes of winning a lucrative science prize with bee students. However, bees gnaw a student and he proves to be allergic. There's a chance to win. But wait, Dexter will do it! In fact, he creates a liquid that makes him invisible. The problem is that a unscrupulous entrepreneur (Cesar Romero) learns about it and decides to use this formula, thank you, for something illegal. Can a bottle steal under Dexter's nose? This is a backing film for TCWT, but one of them did not have to see the first movie to enjoy this movie. Russell is a brilliant leader who comes when it really counts. The rest of the cast is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high respect today. The script is simply innocent entertainment that is charming, with somewhat simple effects, according to today's standards, but still effective. If you want to sit back and relive your past era, or want to share a good G-rated movie with your family, it's a great choice. Even though it is over 30 years, there is a great chance that you will see your close giggle blues even now, with this fine film.
