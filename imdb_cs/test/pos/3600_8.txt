Mandolin "Capt. Corelli" is an old-fashioned Roman war, but with sex and nudity, and allegedly no Americans. The story takes place on a Greek island during World War II. The Italians come to the island but with German supervision. There is a romantic triangle made up of a Greek couple and an Italian captain. Nice performance of all actors; Penelope Cruz is still the best.
