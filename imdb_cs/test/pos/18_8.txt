"The Dresser" is perhaps the finest of backstage movies. The film is filled with wit and spirit, largely provided by Norman's "energetic" character (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly homosexual, and certainly has an attraction for the lead artist (Albert Finney) that he helps, the film never dwells on it or does it more than it is. bold style Peter Yates, who worked so well in "Bullitt", is once again exposed and gives the film a sense of realism and cohesion. This is greatly appreciated in a story that has become so tedious. Ultimately, "The Dresser" will carry many people stupid, but it will be a real pleasure for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
