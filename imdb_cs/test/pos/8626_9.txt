I grew up with the movies Abbott and Costello, A. Since my dad grew up with them and both of our surnames are abbott, so we owe deo a little respect, I didn't realize that this movie and others would get it. It was a really classic thing, it was a funny cause of abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was a fun saga, now what I like about jack and beanstalk is that even if a love story is totally boring and that one song prince sings , omg, awefull, but I like the angle they have taken to love, the story, the couple must marry, because one kingdom has little money, they meet in a prison cell and fall in love because they both pretend to be royal and they end up Be a couple, so happy ending, I dont think it was the original version if it was that it should have from this movie, but I think it was original and I love it. but observing it sucks, lol, also when the movie really kicks with giant + abbott and costello it is sooooo funny. when a giant beats a jack in the door and jack screams "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR", it's really funny. And once a joke, where Jack starts to scream the prince, the prince and all those dogs jump him. a little cheezy but really original. I wish they would at least try to remake it, even if I have such an African screaming jack and beanstalk, and I don't think of good cause when I had it on tape it was bad quality also what I think. The beginning is slightly funny in the middle is really really funny, and the end is not funny in the least, but I am 19 years old and when the movie of 52 makes me laugh so hard, it rocks, this movie is really funny. I love their style. also chapters. also the part where jack climbs the beanstalk and everyone is singing a song about what is a dipstick jack and that will be killed, that's pretty funny
