I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and draw people in it in just seven minutes. I think a good movie is one you don't want to end. Eric did a great job of developing the character of microbes and he was a man. He loved the music and voice used for the microbe. I look forward to seeing what Eric has for us in future movies. This is one movie I didn't want to see. Good work.
