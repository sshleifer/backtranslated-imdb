It is a fun and fast pace, because one falsehood leads to the other and the other to the inevitable, surprising conclusion. Tension separates this vacation from everyone else. One wonders how the pieces fit, both during the film and in the future. The actors built the base and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation he can get ... and finally what kind of manipulation can happen! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) prepares for us each one when he tries to protect "Lishku" (Barbara Stanwyck), and that helps us decide who we will eventually be rooted. <br /> <br /> If he could ever reach a perfect world, imperfect people would probably have to undergo a series of events like these. The blatant weakness is that a fake child cries after he reportedly swallowed Uncle Felix's watch. I heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy shop. Watch it and you'll feel like you're somewhere!
