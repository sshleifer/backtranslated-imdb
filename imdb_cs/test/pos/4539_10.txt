This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Are you saying quite pathetic? Oh yeah. But Chris is incredibly incredibly funny. His innocent brilliance is more in this film than in any of his other films. Take a look at both motel scenes where Spade gets caught with the zipper down, and the other: "WE ARE RIDING FOR THE GOD'S LOVE !!!"
