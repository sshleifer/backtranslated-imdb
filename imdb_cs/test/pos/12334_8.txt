"One Dark Night" is the core in the 1980's low budget horror genre. Filled with retro puns, clothes and scenery, "ODN" transports the viewer to an easier time when horror movies were just ... Horror! Nothing so intense that you can't understand what's going on, the movie tells dark fables about what happens when you mess with the dead. Well behaved, it's stable shouting-queens, and fine directorial work by Tom McLoughlin, who enjoys at times, and makes you think what he presents. There is no "Who did this?" and certainly no big twist at the end. It's straightforward and in your horror, from start to finish, with many 80's humors that fit for added spice. I give it "8" simply because some of the special effects at the end of the movie are lagging behind, but at least there's no CGI ... Perfect movie for new fans in the 1980s horror genre, or anyone who wants to live a fun night of horror bliss.
