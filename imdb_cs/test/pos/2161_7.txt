Take a look at the first 20 minutes, even though the tension has not yet hit. We get a pretty good look at the super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after a big bomb test that helped end WWII. Except for strict security, it looks pretty unwavering. Notice how he is a TV show repairer, a commonplace man who takes us to safety. Once that happens, it's like every city-USA, nice houses, quiet streets, kids going to school and family television at the blink. Later we see little Tommy and little Peggy spreading through the streets lined with impressive prospects, separated by locked gates. The movie seems to say, "Okay, we're tough, just because we have to be. But basically we're just people." Now I expect it to be a reassuring message to the Cold War listeners still not used to government "dooms-day" research. It is a clear pursuit of popular reassurance. One darker note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say "When I grow up"; Instead, it's "When I Grow Up". This comment on doubts reflects not only the Los Alamos reality, but also the national one, which in 1952 saw the footage of the apocalyptic H-bomb. Also note how the FBI agents are professionally displayed, which is a standard feature of the McCarthy era tariff. When brute force is needed, it is not them, but a private citizen, Gene Barry, who throws out information from an early version, in my opinion, from the modern era of "publishing." <br /> <br /> As soon as the kidnapping occurs, the voltage will not stop. The intrigues are nicely processed with colored LA places that keep us guessing. The high scenes around the rock dwellings may not be credible as hiding, but the view of northern New Mexico is great. Also, ancient stone flats represent one of the exotic backdrop of the decade. Also note the extensive use of a police helicopter that is being used as a law enforcement tool. Among the otherwise subdued cast, Nancy Gates remains a bright presence as teacher Ellen Haskell. Never charming Hollywood, she was still a great actress and winning personality. I also expect it to be one of Hopper's more successful film directors, and although people have become accustomed to the nuclear threat since then, the film remains a revealing and stunning documentary of its time.
