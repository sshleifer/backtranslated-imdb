The last days is a very, very independent film. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it is missing in many parts. Shooting seems to be quite amateurish at times, dialogues can be a little chopped and the characters aren't impressively complicated. They have little hope for this film, because, as I said, it's very independent. But what is missing in particular aspects of the film may be overlooked because of the story's magic! I can't say the story is extraordinarily original, but the story is still beautiful and cordial in many ways. It's not about being gay versus being equal, it's about faith and how you decide to drive your own life! It's a stupid story that makes you cry and smile at the same time! To be honest, Latter Days is far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and highly recommend it! It is very critical of the religious aspects of our society and homosexuality is involved - but approach it with an open mind and I'm sure most people will enjoy it just like me!
