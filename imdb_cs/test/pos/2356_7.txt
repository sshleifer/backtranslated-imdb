Warner Brothers created this 3D extravaganza, which was the greatest commercial success for Western players in 1953. Guy Madison leads a group of guard corps and misfits to save the two white women that the Indians hold, which is basically all that is for this film. . The 3D format was in its early stages a Hollywood trick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well. Rescuers set off with the ladies and are watched by the Indians until the white men are on the island in the bay. Indian armaments come to the audience continuously, and the spray of tobacco juice directed against the rattle is worthy of a good measure. Madison was quite popular as the TV wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle farmer who is given his ungrateful task by the military. The film was created in just three days.
