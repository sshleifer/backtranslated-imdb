Since there were no CGIs in 1976, I felt the film was quite observable. Studio production was very good and very sophisticated. Background effects were very believable and always appeared as though they were part of the whole set. The actors did OK with regard to the premise of the film, which takes place in the Jules Vern atmosphere, where the prospects and prospects for future exploration were most likely. If I watched this film in 1976, I would probably be amazed at the man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the Earth's core. I'm still wondering why we're not all flying in our cars, but I'm turning. McClure and Cushing have their witty moments, mostly from their facial expressions, which of course makes the movie a campsite that I loved. "Monsters" left something that should be desirable, but the story had a good presumption, although I feel that in these circumstances more credible "things" could be more believable. All in all, you can watch time and fun.
