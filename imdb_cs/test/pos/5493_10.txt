IN THE REQUIREMENT OF FIRE, in my opinion, it is an excellent, exciting and angular action / drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the clothes they had at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who liked phoning with Frank. In a tuxedo that had the end of the movie but looked good. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say that the entire cast and crew have done a great job, loved the setup and couldn't get it. In conclusion, for all you Clint Eastwood fans who have not seen this brilliant, tense, and edge-of-your-seat action / drama / thriller, I highly recommend it.
