I'm not a massive Disney fan but my 7 year old son is getting into them so we've built up quite a collection, and that's one of my favorites. We saw it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we've had to see it halfway since then! OK, as others point out, it's not the most complicated or inventive plot, but it's more than a movie. Great characters, Phil Harris steals a show like Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar's servant is not far away. Music is great - my disabled son always insists on picking him up and dancing with him on "Everyone wants to be Cat", it says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as fun. I'm not sure why some people have such a movie on this movie that is different from the resistance of cats! And yes, it takes several of his suggestions from "101 Dalmations" and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (It's been a long time since I saw it, so I won't compare them), and while "101 Dalmations" is in some ways better For me, "Aristocats" is much more enjoyable. What are these films about? <br /> <br /> Besides "Peter Pan" (now it's 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41-year-old father loves him so you can't ask much more for a family movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent!
