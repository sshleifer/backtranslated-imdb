The Best of American Pie "Bakery". I found humor and conspiracy to be a much more attractive viewer than any of the American Pie movies so far. I also found out about the suitability of the content that it is acceptable for a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I enjoyed this film experience. When the movie was first released, I read a few negative reviews and ended up not seeing it when it was still in the theater. The film has far exceeded my expectations in terms of conspiracy, dialogue / scripting and overall quality. I'll give it two inches up!
