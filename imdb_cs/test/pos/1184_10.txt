For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privileges and power; who resisted the fascism of Johnson / Nixon news; who now, as civil war veterans, fought the Vietnam War every day until the American beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways - it's remarkable how we were unsuccessful.

The size of monsters that for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world. How could we? Even with smoke and bat (bat!)
