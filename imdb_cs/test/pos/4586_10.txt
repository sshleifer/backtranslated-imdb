This movie is BRILLIANT. I don't remember this movie even in theaters, so I thought it was "right on the DVD", I have rather little expectations, even though I'm a big Mike Judge fan. It has some of the same kind of comic future satire as "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but taken to the next level. Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were brilliant in their roles. Needless to say, this film won me in the first 5 minutes, showing above average people with fewer children. and the poorest, dumbest, most horrible people who have a lot of unconscious children, and how it leads to some opposite development. It requires this concept and then shows where we are guided by this gene pool pollution. Unfortunately, I don't think it will last 500 years, as shown, but probably only about 50 years. I already see the shocking rise of "mild retardation" in the general population, the media, and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respect. It seems that the smallest common denominator is, especially in Hollywood and on TV (eg "Jackass the Movie" and any reality shows where it makes you eat something nasty or humiliating for money). All political / social satire party, this movie is also just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! And I don't say it lightly; a few movies actually "LOL" me, but he did. A lot of the best jokes are the word / sight gags in the background so you really need to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and approach a few of them (like when Joe got his government ID and he said "yes" for "hair" and "yes" for "eyes"). Also, the prison engraved on the front of the "House for Individuals" because the cops in the movie (like real-life cops) call all "individuals" instead of people, etc. Again, it was on the screen just for a moment ... that's one from those movies that you can watch over and over and break them down to get through the layers of wit. I also normally watched movies with subtitles, and it freezed me for some jokes that could pass your ears in a dialogue mix, for example, the police are constantly talking about people "excaping" instead of "escaping" and there are many other wrong pronunciations that just broke me. But again, maybe I didn't just pick up the dialogue that mixed with the music / sound effects; it is very gentle but still cheerful. In addition, special effects were really good for sci-fi / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but overall I think this is one of those movies that, if you don't think it's funny, makes you kidding. I plan to recommend it to many, many people!
