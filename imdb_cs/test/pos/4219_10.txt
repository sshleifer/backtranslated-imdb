I know this film is not for everyone, and I will not push your opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel this movie ... It was the best I have ever seen! !! It was fun soooooooooooooooooo, and although it wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat because I didn't know what would happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have to see this!
