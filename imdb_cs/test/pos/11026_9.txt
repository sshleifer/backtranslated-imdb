There are many things to admire on this film, but the thing that got me over everyone else was part of the eccentric loneliness that Hollywood loves and romanticizes, but which is absolutely convincing and unlike any character I'm with has met. in film or life. Also a very convincing and disturbing depiction of Tourete's syndrome
