Refers to German rocket scientist Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen), who works in the United States of America. the onset of World War II. Fear Hitler can remember him in Germany to help him prepare for war, Zucher and his slippery assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuated by the British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They were given the task of building a rocket mailbox to enable islanders to communicate with the mainland. Mocked and bullying islanders, they settled home with local girl Catherine Mackay (overwhelming Shauna MacDonald), with whom Thomsen starts the business, but complications arise when Germany comes to call ... <br /> The central romance between Zucher and Catherine is a subtle and honestly played and supportive cast is a varied game with a field of respected Scottish actors including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell.
