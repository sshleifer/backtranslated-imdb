At first I honestly thought it would be a shabby movie. But when I saw it, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny with supportive casting (Especially the character who plays "Bullet tooth Tony" by Snatch. What a contrasting role between the two movies!). Now I'm not the one who says whether or not an actor is good, but her act, especially, was thoroughly enjoyable. Although the conspiracy has shifted into the love triangle of a tiny bopper (albeit very funny) to the middle of the movie, I feel that it should not compromise what I think the movie really is: just fun. So if you come across it, be it DVD or theater, I believe you will enjoy it.
