1957 Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, stars John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It is the story of a restless man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually unfolds during the film. He has a connection that gives him work on a loading dock that works for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real criminal who takes bribes from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has intense resistance to the black man, T.T. (Poitier) who holds the same position. T.T. calls on Axel to work on his team; Axel defies Charlie and does it. Axel finds a place to live and associate with T.T., his wife (Dee) and their son's white teacher (Kathleen McGuire). When the tragedy strikes, none of the men on the loading dock talk to the police and Axel has to cope with his values ​​and the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> a really great black and white movie that's not really about being black or white! It's really about the limits one puts and knows who you are. Charlie is bigot and hates that a black man is well placed on the dock. T.T. Charease conquers and gives as good as he gets. About T.T. and the son of T.T. does not concern or spend time with Axel either. with a white teacher the family also meets. What Axel, lonely, will find it difficult to accept any friendship or entrust to anyone - these things are taught through TT <br /> <br /> Poitier is totally lit in "Edge of the City" smart, man with real enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. Cassavetes is great and plays the opposite character - hiding in the shade, chronically depressed and always nervous. <br /> <br /> The film goes away, what happens to Axel. Whatever it is, he's another man now. Strangely underestimated and unknown film, maybe in the shadow of many angry young men's movies that came out at the time.
