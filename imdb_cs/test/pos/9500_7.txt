Do not change your husband, is on the one hand, the beginning of a series of light marriage comedies from Cecil B. DeMille. On the other hand, this is his first picture, where Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest silent era actress, appeared, and it's a movie that made her a star. and his films have become more verbal and less purely visual, with such a prominent performer as Swanson, we gain much of this silent narrative style. Her character does very little, but expresses volumes through a gentle gesture and facial expression? with a special talent for contempt. In real life, Swanson found herself at the end of her disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and it may have sparked her convincing performance. Framing and shots are particularly strong here. He uses film technique to show off acting? Often Hold Swanson In Long Close-Ups At Key Moments? and also visually clarify the story. For example, when we are familiar with the character of Toodles, it will appear in the mirror of the dressing table three times. Her character disappears from the story just to become important to the end. The first shot that pulled her in helps us remember who he was. Later, at the annual dinner, Swanson and future husband number two Lew Cody are framed together in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own frame. Taky ?? and is this a sign of growing film sophistication in general? there is much use of shots reactions? for example, a disapproving view of the bishop when Cody deals with his intentions with the dolls for wedding figures. As I noted in several other notes, Macpherson could have put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille, she tended to put her themes in a rather opulent and spectacular style. So we get these very long quasi-philosophical cover cards about the pitfalls of female life, which, if at all improved, is just because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could come up with a line as "Destiny Sometimes Lurking in Christmas Shopping". Fortunately, though in this picture, these titles usually refer to scenes rather than smashing them. for spectacular. You see him start sneaking in apologies for a little razzmatazza, such as the small Swanson fantasy scenes that are showered with "pleasure, wealth, and love." It would not be until the early twenties after the unofficial historical photography embargo was lifted, that he would have a chance to go out with a great show. All in all Husband is a pretty decent DeMille silent picture, though being honest it is only really the presence of Gloria Swanson that picks it up above average. It's curious that it's supposedly a comedy, and Swanson has been cast at least in part because of her background at Mack Sennett's factory. She hated comedy and gave it more dramatic than a comic show. It makes sense that the only direct drama she did with DeMille, a man and a woman, was by far the strongest of their collaboration.
