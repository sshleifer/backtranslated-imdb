This Columbo episode is one of the better and maybe one of my favorite favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's child John Cassavetes as maestro, his wife played Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother) and his mother-in-law played Myrna Loy (one of America's greatest actresses in the film of our time). Anyway, I disagree with anyone who criticizes this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a great job of performing. I like watching Columba with his beloved dog, which he never mentions in the series. This time the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A. Of course Columbo is interested in classical music because he does something else, including crime.
