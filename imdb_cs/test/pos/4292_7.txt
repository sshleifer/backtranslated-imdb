An old man rides his bike on a country road when the car comes out of the blue, hits him dead and continues driving. He spends the rest of the film discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder would have on the rest of the village. A separate lie is really a British movie really. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, decent citizen with a "hard upper lip" to tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. The man who truly lives in the sleepy city of playboy millionaire William Bule played deliciously devilish Rupert Everett (most American viewers will always remember him as Julia Roberts' gay friend who completely stole every scene My Best Friend's Wedding). In separate lies, Everett is cruel, cold, and selfish, but it's a complete explosion on the screen. No, it's not such an exciting movie title (Separate Lies? How did they end up with this lame and a forgotten title? They just don't have a marketing team?
