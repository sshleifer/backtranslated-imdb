Mikhail Kalatozov's Flying Cranes is an excellent movie. The winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival has an outstanding cinematography and a performance by Tatyana Samojlov√°, the only Russian actress ever to win the Cannes Prize. She plays Veronica, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and worried, with plans for a wedding. Her life will be upside down when World War II strikes and her friend volunteers into the army. The film captures the influence of war on the love of teenagers and the people who stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight, wait for a letter or other information. It is a depiction of lost innocence. Samojlova does a great job and her character transformation will break your heart. Camera movement is fast with lots of detail, it's a dance camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it's not the only scene, later on the scene where Veronika tries to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the strongest scenes in the history of the movie, bombing Veronica's house while running downstairs her apartment was completely destroyed. Just great! 10 of 10.
