I enjoyed this film very much. I read the book ten years ago and wondered how to translate it into a movie. The screenplay is very true to the book that I charmed - this is a rarity in itself these days. Characterization was solid and credible, and stroytelling kept me moving in my perceptions, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> Intelligent and well-crafted movie.
