I saw that this film counts times and we still can't get sick of it. It's like a drug. I know that many people don't like it, but there's something about what's attracting me. Every show is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She didn't just play the role of Akasha she had become. Her body movement and beauty were captured exceptionally well. It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of the Egyptian Queen (No, I'm not a pre-prejudice against white people, I'm one). True, it is not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were, but that was a nice change. Stuart Townsend totally forgot me that Tom Cruise has played Lestat and Marguerite. Overall, it was a good time for movies. For those who haven't seen it, make sure you watch it with an open mind and don't take it too seriously. It's a vampire movie that becomes a rock star. Take it.
