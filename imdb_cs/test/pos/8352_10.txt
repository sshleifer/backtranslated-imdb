This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable! His little yelps when he is scared, and the funniest parts are when: Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sing 'Ive never felt it. Fully recommend this movie, its coming out on a special edition on June 20th. The cover has a scamp on the garbage can and Angel under the lid. I just can't explain this movie more than romantic, charming, hilarious and adorable. The junkyard scenes are funny, all the junkyard dogs have something special. when it comes out, it has new features!
