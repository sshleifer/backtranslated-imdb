When I first saw Satan's brotherhood, I was twelve years old, I saw it in a small town in central Washington, which played before Tales from the crypt we had left earlier because my sisters were already frightened of Satan's brotherhood. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie. The start was good when we sat down and the tank made a number on this car. What amazed me about the film was the scenery around the city in which it was filmed, looking almost like the area around Chelan WA where I saw the movie, especially when they were driving towards the town of Hillsboro, which is the place of film small town in SW New Mexico. I always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman, who was on Get Smart another show I like. I gave the film 7 and later, when I saw the stories from the crypt, I thought Satan's brotherhood was better.
