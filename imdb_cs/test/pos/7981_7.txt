This movie is where the Batman series should stop. Although I admit that the ideas of "Batman Forever" were excellent and could be easily implemented by a competent director, as it turned out, that was not the case. Warner Brothers executives were apparently disappointed at how dark this second Batman movie from Tim Burton was. Aside from the idiocy to expect something different from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into homage to the television series of the 1960s, I don't understand how "Batman Returns" can be considered unsatisfactory. It is true that this is not entirely equal to the first film - even though it corrects all the minor flaws of the style found in "Batman", which is a weaker scenario that divides antagonism not only between two but also three characters that invite unflattering . compared to the master pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this, a beautifully dark film remains true, according to the way Batman was always meant to be, and very satisfying. Michael Keaton returns as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, entangled with Max Schreck's nouveau riche tycoon (Christopher Walken, named in honor of the German silent actor of the 1920s), his partner in the crime Oswald Cobblepot, a penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant make-up reminiscent of Laurence Olivier "Richard III") and Selina Kyle, Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom Wayne talks to both herself and Batman. Four directors are transforming themselves into excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together with Keaton and Pfeiffer, they explore the darker side of double identities. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting concepts in this movie. The only weakness I can really point out is some weakness in the script in some places, which in my opinion is primarily the way this film is a quadrilateral fight. There is simply not enough time to properly investigate what is happening. However, this is a damn good movie. I highly recommend watching it in conjunction with the first, and then crying at how good the series could be, that it continued under Burton and Keaton.
