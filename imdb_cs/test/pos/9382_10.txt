Watching "Death Bed: a bed that eats" is like waking up in a hospital, two days of suicide <br /> <br /> watching, disorienting but strangely stimulating. There are several film equivalents to this disturbing but often witty lesson in mythology, morality and surrealistic ideology. Experimental work of Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" and Maya Deren's taste of the strange atmosphere found in DEATH BED. A close comparison is the dark adult fairy tales of literary genius Angela Carter, the short disturbing stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the past, but displays a totally unique and original story. <br /> <br /> As a story, DEATH BED is amazingly simple, yet original <br /> vision, something that can only accomplish one in a thousand independent versions. This inconspicuous film has its technical flaws, but it is overcome by the cast of beautiful non-actors <br /> <br /> and the lost haunted places - a true independent classic of the 1970s. DEATH BED also displays a unique, subversive, 3-dimensional personality - a deep and continuous layering of dreams and ideas that lend it a fun-house construct. Time progress told in flashbacks and historical time travel books, a bed with his sinister black humor, a rich yet underrated symbolism used within his paintings. The most agreeable is the picture of Aubrey Beardsly, a suffering artist, imprisoned forever in his own painting, reporting to him and reveling the murdered victims of "sacrifices" sacrificed to him as a love sacrifice to the spirit of demented bed. - Sick refrain and amazing element / metaphor for "pastic artist" - Nothing but the weirdest thing in POE or MALLARME can be. Everyone who values ​​the spirit of independent film and longs for a multi-layered symbolic experience, or longs for a surrealistic concept of "spasmodic <br /> beauty" and gothic horror slants, low-energy filmmaking will dig this absolutely unique vision. A simple and fun movie with deliciously deep psychic undercuts. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
