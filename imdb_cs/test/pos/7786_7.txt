After the success of GHAYAL, RKS began working on this film, which was a comedy The film was in preparation for 3 years and finally released in 1994, but did not work for some reason Before this film, DAMINI (93) released and did well <br /> <br The film is a crazy comic movie like most Priyadarshan movies, but it's funny and well-crafted The film has a proper plot in contrast to today's movies and makes you laugh most of the characters made famous, be it the main criminal gogo (Shakti ). Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and more <br /> <br /> The film will keep you running all the time, even if it's too grotesque and exaggerated, yet it's one of the funniest movies <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is very good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors Aamir steals the show and brings his funniest performance, it was his first out out comedy Salman does well but looks amateur front Aamir but does a good job and their chemistry is wonderful Karisma being uncomfortable and sounding like Raveen's child Paresh Rawal is too funny in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is hilarious in his over-the-top act Shehzad Khan (dubbed Ajit) is very good and too Viju Khote is a fun rest all are good too
