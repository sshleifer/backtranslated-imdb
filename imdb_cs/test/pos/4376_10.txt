It's bad for Ya to really showcases more talent George Carlin. He really is as sharp as a nut. It's a pity we lost it last year, but his comedy will live forever. This stand-up specialist is literally one of the funniest I've ever heard of a comedian. While making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh, as some things say. It is true that Carlin can literally do something that seems rude and turn him into one of the funniest things you have ever heard. I really enjoyed this stand-up especially from Carlin and I recommend that those who like this control have more than a standard.
