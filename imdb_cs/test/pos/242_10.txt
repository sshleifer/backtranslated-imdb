I really like this movie because of all the stars and dance and the story that is related to it. Rita Hayworth was the most beautiful in this musical and the costumes were beautiful. Though the musical, I thought Rita Hayworth also made a dramatic performance in this movie. As for her dance, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable supported Rita's dance in this movie by commenting that Rita was dancing rings around her own dance and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. Cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. Rita wants to be a magazine cover but is also in love with her mentor, played by Gene Kelly. Leaving Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypassing Broadway's love and glory, or sticking around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You'll have to watch a movie to find out!
