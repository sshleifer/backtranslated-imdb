This movie means "Boys' n Hood," "Threat to Society", "South Central" and others its ilk and even shares actors with some of them. Mentality "us vs. the law of the film is underlined by all black neighbors and almost the entire white police. Here, the cops are so bad that they look like cartoons and they even ambush a boy in one scene when they drive a car they just "freed" from their owner. It's like a bushwhacking from an old Western, but the current setting makes it all too real. The story focuses on young Jason Petty and his friends, who are school just a nuisance from their "real job" of strengthening cars. It happens to be Newark, N.J., a city of rusty belt with low jobs, but notoriously high on crime. In fact, the problem is so serious that the cops have written "Theft of the Car" on their backs to show that the whole unit must be dedicated to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> Boys use thin Jim "to shatter to the cars and go for driving fun, as if it wasn't a big deal." They get into trouble when the police raid them. Harmful, the Nazi Lieutenant has a vendetta against the boys and does not see them as human beings who might be worthy of redemption but as human targets. In fact, he is somewhat reminiscent of the sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw Ghetto who shot down Jews for pleasure in the movie "Schindler's List". When the boys steal a police car in retaliation for the assault, things will go down predictably. They are heavily beaten by cops and Jason eventually ends up in jail. It is clear that they are "bad boys" who would steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing that Jason protects his sister and his friend, who cares for his own grandmother. The film has left us and wondered on which side it should move and who feels sadder: boys whose lives leave the sewer, honest citizens whose cars are stolen left and right and which could be caught in the crossfire gunfights at each the place of the moment or the city of Newark itself, whose spirit is betrayed by brutal, soul dead cops. Despite the fact that this film has appeared above, the film offers realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, protagonists and their families, and a car theft culture in the city, where there are only two career paths - law enforcement and crime. The strange thing is that the whole subject of drugs is never mentioned. The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, which we hope is not as bad as they are depicted here. However, they gave us one more powerful, influential story about the inner city and the black youth who broke up and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.
