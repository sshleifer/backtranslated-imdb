I saw previews everywhere before I decided to watch. And what you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist of 18th century England. Although the music on the dance scene was obviously modernized and the colors of Clother's Liv Tyler (though pretty!), They fit perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you want just so well, you should check this. Very different from other detailed 18th century films.
