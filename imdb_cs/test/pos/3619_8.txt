Just like when you try to get a 400 plus book page and inject it into a two-hour movie, it's lost a lot. Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) is on a very ambitious project and almost pulls out. What we get is a charming and emotionally impressive film that seems to be incomplete. <br /> <br /> There's a lot about this movie that's amazing and fantastic. John Toll's cinematography (cameraman for brave heart and fall legends, Oscar victory for both) is beautiful. When working with Madden, the location options on the Greek island of Kefallonia are excellent and the visuals that come from photographing these majestic places in different lighting conditions are fresh and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as townspeople, giving the city an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also amazing and the mandolin passages and vocals of the Italian soldiers are amazing. Madden has a great job in bringing us the Italian occupation and romance, which takes up a larger part of the film. . There are many sweet and funny moments in this segment. However, at a time when a serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there is not much film in the coil, and this component is extremely rushed and shortened. While the battle scenes are well done, it is clear after the battle that they are increasingly compromised to keep the film running for too long. By the time we get to the post-war scenes, treatment is skeletal. Another negative is that the DVD is especially low on features. Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as a sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When he has to fight, Cage goes smoothly into the team of wild principle and determination and somehow remains believable in both people. Penelope Cruz, who loves the camera, gives uninspired performance like Pelagia. The part is because Cage is so dominating on the screen, but Cruz seems too calm in the part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. She allows the character to be objectified rather than interested in Corelli's love than to build it as a strong character in her own right. John Hurt gives fantastic performance as a wise old doctor who knows nature as a medicine about people. However, Christian Bale seems a little crowded and stiff as Pelagia's fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8/10. Despite some disadvantages, this is a moving film that is well worth seeing. The photo itself is worth the admission.
