Luc Besson's first work is also his first sci-fi attack, a genre he returns to fourteen years later with the Fifth Element (1997). Although this movie was strongly influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still very enjoyable. In 1983, le Dernier Combat reveals Besson's own science fiction approach. He takes back the theme he likes and his effort is recognizable for creating a stylish job. Shot in a widescreen and black-and-white environment, the disaster has destroyed virtually all the population of the country, and we will never know what a disaster is and why men can no longer speak. Several barbarian mountains were formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and comes to an unrecognizable Paris, where a doctor (Jean Bouise) receives him. There are no words in Besson's work. The activities of the characters and the progress of the events go through glances and gestures. Although the starting point and background are disturbing, the film never looks desperate. Man and physician seem to be trying to reproduce the gestures and actions associated with humanity before the disaster. The film opens with a man who has sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to talk him through the machine and in his spare time he is a painter. It's all the more interesting that these paintings come from prehistoric times. Following this consideration, one could argue that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies the evil and threat to the effort developed by the man and the doctor to regain what ultimately made man. Ditto for gangs baddies at the beginning of the movie. The pessimistic whiff, which could make such a movie, is not really in the foreground and gives way to a flash of hope. Personally, the movie could get without music at all except the one that one can hear with its cassette recorder. Luc Besson was supposed to do better and ever more fascinating films like this, and he also strengthened Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave behind a disparate job in the future: "Higher Power" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), "ma Petite Entreprise "(1999) or" Filles Uniques "(2003).
