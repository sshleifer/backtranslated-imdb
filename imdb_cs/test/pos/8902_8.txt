Throughout my life, I have been a faithful Asterix fan and I must say that "Asterix and the Vikings" are probably the most successful of all Asterix films. He has some funny jokes and animation is excellent. As many have pointed out that there is not really a plot of comics ("Asterix and Normans") very closely, but in many respects it is just as good, because this book excels in my mind like the one that has a lot of fun in culture The 1960s, and much of it is very dated today. What really tricked me the wrong way is how they incorporated the Disney style plot into a movie that was a lot away from Asterix and Obelix. We have a poorly understood boy who doesn't fit, Justforkix. We have a girl who doesn't fit because she wants to be considered straight, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is compromised because the boy is ashamed to be completely honest with the girl, but eventually their love wins. It was the story of so many Disney (and are just, other studios too) movies that his not funny and the storyline was dated twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a whimsical animal sidekick. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find this derivative and clich√©, but it really told me and left me dissatisfied. I think it's talking about how great the rest of the movie is, that I was still thinking very well about it, despite how the story was kidnapped.
