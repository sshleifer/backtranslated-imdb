The Chinese film title "In the Mood for Love" is "fa yeung nien wah." This can be interpreted as "those blooming years (once they were)." <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well-folded piece. A complex love story told by a simple visual approach. Writer-director Wong Kar-Wai choreographed heart dance - it's her, it's him, it's love. I hear Galasso topic: dum dum-dum, dum dum and strings - almost like a pulse. A piece with overture, stanzas and epilogue. Director optimized music usage (Michael Galasse score, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish and Chinese songs / melodies). Rhythm and lyrics invite viewers to what they feel rather than verbal dialogues. I hear Nat King Cole gives us clues: "Aquello?" Nostalgia pervades the film. Rich design details: handbags and ties; Japanese rice cooker novelty; stuffed pattern of green glass cups and plates and plates (I remember daddy valued those at home); mahjong session; kitchenette; Bedroom; thermos for pulling noodles that swing when they walk. Slim and shapely, Maggie Cheung looks great in the fashionable patterns and colors of the traditional Chinese woman's "cheung sam". Every change in her dress marks the next day, another time in the story. Wong Kar-Wai is so resourceful. The scenes can be in the same place, but they are in a different mood, proceeding to the next stanza. Up the stairs up and down into the carved noodle rack. Standing by the wall around the corner in the flats like rain pours. Along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner. Trivia: So he helps him write his martial arts novel. Maggie would be able to help because she was in kung fu / martial arts movies. "Three Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three super heroes fighting against the evil. If you appreciate the performance of Tony Leung, not miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second segment - romantic rhythm with difference) and "Happy Together" 1997 written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. When I was able to understand Cantonese and Shanghai dialects and visited the official site, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here's the sharing of my Chinese subtitle version: <br /> <br /> It was a kind of unbearable encounter. She gave him a chance to get closer He didn't have the courage to be closer She turned, left. <br /> <br /> The time and place have gone past. Everything that belongs to no longer exists. Those who disappear seem to be separated by glass dust, they see, but they cannot understand it. All the time he wanted everything that was past. the dust that has been collected will return to the long vanished times. Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - "inner and outer", "spirit and body" of life. , love and life. <br /> [Resend.
