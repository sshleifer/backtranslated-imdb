Story The Chinese High Story tells the story of a righteous monk Tripitaka, who, along with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy, makes their way west on the road to the restoration of the ancient Sutras, finally reaching their final stage in Shache City. it is not as if the city is attacked by evil demons. The monkey is trying to fight them, but he is overwhelmed because he knew his master was in serious danger, using his trusted golden staff to push the Tripitak into safety. The monk ends up when he lands when he wakes up, finds himself in the presence of a young lizard named Maiyan, who sets off to our young hero quite brightly, after many verbal misunderstandings, Maiyan convinces that Tripitaka she loves her, so when a monk decides to save the Monkey and the others. insists that he accompany him. A mismatched couple starts their adventure together. REVIEW Okay, so this is another movie Journey to the West, which is not a bad thing for me because I love the story and the characters associated with it, so I was a little excited to get on DVD. So I think I will start my review with a story that is everywhere, initially it was your standard fantasy movie, then it became a ridiculous comedy, then suddenly became full of science fiction when director Jeff Lau experimented with mixing genres and then he did quite scatological work with this film. I think it's a totally unique approach by having a story center on a character other than the infamous Monkey King, especially with a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then putting him in what's at its heart a love story. So overall I liked it. Acting is largely solid, with leaders Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi leading some very good performances, though Ah Char spends most of the time on screen for some. somewhat ugly makeup. The support cast is nicely assembled, includes all the usual EEG main stays, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong perform, one actor I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King, did a good job with the limited material he looked like that he was given to him, played a version of the monkey king, which was still somewhat arrogant, I felt he would restore the territory of the Twins Effect II, but fortunately it is not. I hope he can do it himself in a central role because the film is left open for continuation. Okay, so let's go down to directing, which is again Lau everywhere, Lau gives too much time to Stephen Chow-esquire nonsense comedy that includes a scene where Tripitaka, in order to solidify himself, dresses As Spider-Man, I assume that leads to many head scratching moment because the film is meant to be set in ancient China. He creates a few nice and gentle moments between the two leaders and delves into a clever territory, but this reviewer sometimes enjoys a little sap, so it didn't bother me at all. Right, now on CGI, which is for the most part bearable, there are many moments that seem to belong to PS2, like many other reviews, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene in which Monkey fights a flying minion. A lot of CG gags are provided in the form of a golden staff that turns into a variety of things, ranging from a giant fly jacket to a moss suit directly from The Matrix Revolutions. Okay, that sounds crazy, but I think you have to see it to believe it. All right, so when closing the Chinese Tall Story, there's no film without its mistakes, but it stays together long enough to be entertained and generally be a fun movie in general. If all of the above doesn't guide you to see it this way, it's much better than the Twins Effect II.
