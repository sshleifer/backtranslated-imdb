I had the opportunity to see this last night at the local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and made an hourly Q&A afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly executed document; Thereafter, Herzog explained that he did not consider his films as a real documentary, because the facts sometimes mask the truth. Instead he scripts some scenes and ad-libs some to introduce a new element that may have been dropped if he followed the original outline. Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is the real person you fall in love with; you encourage him, you feel the anxiety he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy of life he exhibited here 30 years after Viet Cong was taken into captivity. You are disappointed to hear that Dieter recently failed. <br /> <br /> As with most Herzog movies, these pictures are amazingly beautiful with a great choice of background music. Especially the scene of the battle taken from the archives of the Vietnam War, which fits into the storyline of Dieter. The core of the film, Dieter, returned to the hell jungle where he was a prisoner of war. their travels with some locals. Anxious for us to watch, I can't imagine what he felt when he was bound again. One of the better movies that would portray the Vietnam War nightmare. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
