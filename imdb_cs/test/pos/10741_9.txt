This excellent movie has the best acting you ever see, and that in itself has to see it. The whole cast is great, but then it had to be to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me long to get to this movie, and besides a courtroom scene that's just good, it's fun. This is a rare film that has earned all the Oscar recognition it has received. You see it yourself and you will certainly not be disappointed.
