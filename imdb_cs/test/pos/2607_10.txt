In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his favorite children, OUR GANG, to split up. into feature films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two LITTLE COLONEL (LITTLEST REBEL) 1935 Civil War films, it was natural that Roach would look in the same direction as his GANG.

'Even quite Rosina Lawrence (GANG schoolgirl) turns out to be playing Holmes' beloved. Irving Pichel is especially slimy as a cowardly cardsharp who has changed the vengeful Captain Yankee.

It should be noted that there is racism in the film that is unusual for Hollywood at the time, but is almost absent from the original OUR series.
