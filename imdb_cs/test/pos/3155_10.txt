Just see it! It's a clever movie, but it's too heavy to understand for the first time. You see it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally designed to create a feeling, feel, or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the sharpness of some sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pop, cracking, hissing, and barely audible sounds. The structure is nonlinear and cyclic. Themes repeat as time runs clockwise and counterclockwise. The "conspiracy" and "anticipation" expectations are broken by the unconventional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and old as humanity. . Dion Dennis, PhD
