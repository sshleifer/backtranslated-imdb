Since it's basically a low budget cast, it's a surprisingly good movie about the life and death of Buddy Holly, a rock pioneer. Gary Busey plays as Holly, who was one of the first to use electric guitar for almost all of her music. Leaning on her crickets, Holly had a series of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to fame, marriage to his pet, and possible death. I like this movie and I believe you too. Charles Martin Smith has a great job in this movie.
