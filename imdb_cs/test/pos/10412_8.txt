I think it's great how Chiller picked up this series and showed it to this generation. Film production is so long, especially with special effects, and for those who are able to watch archived shows that they never knew they would exist, they will certainly be able to see progress compared to today. MONSTERS is neither lame nor magnificent, but it is fun. It takes creativity for the types of story lines they've come up with, and each generation has its own horror series. This series wasn't as frightening as the fifth 13th, series, or as an adult-oriented Freddy's nightmare ... it was something the whole family could watch and still laugh and fear at the same time. I'm glad Chiller Channel shows it's in their line-up, I'm just on those episodes I missed when I grew up.
