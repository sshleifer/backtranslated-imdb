Margaret Colin acts as the main character in this story; as I watched, I remembered her bit part in "Ünfaithful" Adrian Lynes, who is the neighbor of Diane Lane in the neighborhood of Tony NY. This film was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserved awards for accurate portrayal of the class, crimes and offenses that actually occur in luxury neighborhoods (thought to die!) It's real, but not too much dramatizované; viewers live through her accident, the pain she has caused, the denial; and final decision. It's more than just a question of "what a good man" is, as Colin talks to her husband ... is a person's character defined by one single act; and should they be forever condemned for their act? Questions are relevant; It is also amusing to see several movie links to Martha Stewart (ie Anxious, Annoying Mother), Colin is reputed by her ever friends to be "perfect hostess, with perfect genes" .... (gag); and the scene where Colin is confronted by the police, ("friends" also betrays her, later) .... <br /> <br /> Denial and facade of American society are addressed; (Oh, the murder does not occur here; similar to "Purgatory Season", by Dominick Dunn, about the actual murder of Martha Moxley; in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime; but consciously finds himself in keeping the facade until it breaks, rents or buys this film; She is an underestimated actress who performs well in these roles.
