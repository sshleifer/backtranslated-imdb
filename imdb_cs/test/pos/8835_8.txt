The history of television adaptations is dotted with aberrations that almost convincingly prove that tradition should never begin in the first place. But there are some examples that he can pull out, just. Rising Damp would initially look like the last big screen sitcom, because this cheerful series was based in the small space of the northern bed. Also, writer, Eric Chappell, wasn't paid enough to spend time creating a completely original script, so he reaped a lot of TV episodes and stitched them together to create the body of the film. This in itself did not necessarily mean that the script failed. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same with their dad's script and it worked great. Although, soon Dada's military episodes, with their calm pace and over the arch fence, lent themselves far to film adaptation. Rising Damp episodes, however, were high energy issues from the first scene to the breath. As a result, as one story is completed and the other began, scenes within the film become dissatisfied. Another pitfall for the movie version of the TV series is the inevitable comparison that is being made. In this regard, the film fades compared to the brilliant Rising Damp series. Despite all this, Rising Damp's film manages to be fun and sometimes awake. Perhaps it is not surprising that the most beautiful moments appear during sequences written specifically for film. This includes a rugby match where Rossiter makes a brilliantly timed pratfall. In fact, while all cast handle their roles perfectly (a bar sub standard alternate actor for late and really big Beckinsale), it's Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby who shines the most. In fact, Rising Damp should be made as a movie, so Rossiter could be eligible for an Oscar, such is the grandeur of his acting talent. He was not even nominated. Eventually, the film does not match the dizzying heights of the TV series, while he can keep his own comedy as such, with some beautiful moments. Recommended tracking. Last thing: The opening and closing music is by far the worst in film history.
