I don't know where this movie was shot, but because it was filmed on the spot, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of a young English woman who is captured by the Japanese in South Asia with a group of other English women at the beginning of World War II. There is no prison camp for women, so they are forced to march months to place because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The basis of the film is the courage and resilience of English women and the bravery of an Australian soldier trying to help them. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch as it was shown on PBS, as a series that actually adds a feeling of endless journey this woman makes from England, through this remote island, and finally Australia. The story, the cinematography, the location, and the actors unite to miss this movie. My only question is why it wasn't released on DVD!
