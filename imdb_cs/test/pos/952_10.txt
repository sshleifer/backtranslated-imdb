Ghilli is the best vijay movie & one of the greatest hits in his career .... As I did not see Telega movie, so I could enjoy this movie even more. take. Since she is a goon, there is no body ready to help the heroine. Vijay, who came to play Kabaddi's match, sees it and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her and how the girl finally escapes the clutches of goon and goon's father's political friends. The film has plenty of seat edge thriller moments and will keep the viewer going. Vijay is usually very good in the role of kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, a bunch of vijay friends all did their job competently. Special mention must be made of the criminal of the film Prakashraj. The character of the villain was properly etched and the prakashraj portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt compassion for the villain. The "Hello Chellam" dialogue really caught up with the masses. Vidyasagar's music is brilliant, and the song 'apadi podu' is rage everywhere.
