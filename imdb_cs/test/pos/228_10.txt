To say it's a good show, there's nothing at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for the Airplane and other cheerful and brilliant movies. Writing is excellent. Even if the show is built on one-layer hair, it does not become excessive or unpleasant. Leslie Nielsen stretches his comedy muscle to the full, as if to say: You haven't seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce the Naked Gun. When you watch these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they may not change too much. The show was really a test ground for larger and better versions to come later.
