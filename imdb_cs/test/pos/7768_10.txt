Although I have not always agreed with Gene Siskel, I agree with him. Love Jones is a shining example of how a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations. Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry. You feel the atmosphere between the two whenever they're on the screen and its fantastic. Isaiah Washington is as big as Darius's close friend Savon, and I sigh every time I see him in the movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is destroyed by the lowlifes industry and the children's games they play. You can believe he called a little weasel on Gray's anatomy from his name, but anyone who knows how Follywood works knows better than trusting an "official story" from where he believes. In any case ... Love Jones is an amazing love story full of interesting and sympathetic characters who are in realistic situations that anyone who has fallen in love with. You love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. There is not one obscene stereotype. Contrast that with Romance movies toady. Exactly. When closing, if you like Black Cinema, then you should make your own copy of this movie.
