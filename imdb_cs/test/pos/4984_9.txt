That was a very good Western 1950s, one of the best that I have seen in the decade that this genre has featured on screen and on television. He certainly had three big marquee actors: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this movie, while the other two stars were in supporting roles. Ford had much of the dialogue. He was also a "good guy" while Robinson was a "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played really hard in this film and the character she played was sometimes a bit contradictory. Ford dominated his main status very sharply, as he usually did - especially in Westerns. He played a nice guy who didn't want to fight, he was a quiet man ...... but if you pushed him ..... watch out! The story had a nice mix and inactivity. It had an expansive Western setting that was put to good use with the CineamaScope Widescreen. It also featured realistic people in a realistic environment. This credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was most impressive. The men in this film stand out from women, perform and have character. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only production negatives. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. they are or what you are used to seeing. For classic movie fans, it is almost a necessity with this cast and a good story. Highly recommended.
