A nice, funny mix of the music hall (mostly in the first third) and police procedural secrets of how the various suspicious stories begin to collapse. Final murder exposure can be a surprise if you don't watch closely. A bold look at Paris of that time. You can ignore the last scene (Hollywood end). Louis Jouvet is the best police inspector who seems to be just going through, but he's really at the top of things.
