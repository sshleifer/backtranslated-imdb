At the beginning of the 1980s, the creature concerned the long-abandoned gold mine, which is determined to try some intrepid miners. Of course, there is no gold, but one very hungry monster that is in search of prey. Although I have to be honest and admit that I thought it was boring at first (I personally prefer thematically similar "Boogens"), it actually grew up on me as it went on. The characters are not very interesting or actors now. The most interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, the female management of Terri Berland is pretty good looking and Rolf Theison makes his indigenous blockbuster easy to hate. Writer Playing Effects Man Mark Sawicki wears thin fast. It starts in a comfortably predictable way, with a night set piece in which two victims are claiming to get things to an acceptable start. The monster itself is interesting for its design (as you can imagine, it gets revealed a little at a time until the end of the game) and for being a product of animation stopping when the process is no longer used. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (directed by David Michael Hillman) and the crew deserve some appreciation for creating an atmosphere. They will make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. The film puts it in the direction of a pretty good end. All you have to do is say that on their low budget they do their best. An obscure little object worth looking for worse horror enthusiasts. <br/> 7/10
