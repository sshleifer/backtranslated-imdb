I think the filmographic line can run like this. Please pay attention because I had to find it. In 1967, Peter Yates, an ex auto racer, drives the English caper movie "Robbery," the most exciting part of which is car chase through the streets of London, down the aisles where there are crowds of children playing and it all. It's a success. A year later, Yates directs "Bullet", starring Steve McCool, I mean McQueen, featuring another even more spectacular chase after the car up and down the San Francisco Hills, with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds it looks like includes double pinching, full racing cameras, no dampers, twelve-cylinder engines under forty-puppets, supercharged, superdupercharged, and all five-thousand horsepower running at full tilt. Many shots of McQueen's chewing chewing expression frowned with concentration as he tried to drive another car off the highway, even if the passenger in the second car took a shotgun. The persecution is organized by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives a criminal vehicle. A Year or Two Later, Feeling a Good Thing, Bill Friedkin Drives a "French Connection," featuring a chase between a squad vehicle in command of a squad (Gene Hackman) and an elevated train in New York. A lot of shots of Hackman's cursed face as he struggles with the vehicle on the streets. The persecution is organized by Philip D'Antoni. Followed by Academic Awards. When you feel a good thing, a year or two will bring us "The Seven Ups", where there will be a chase between the car run by Roy Scheider, with lots of shots of Scheider's cursed face. he's trying to hit another car that is driven by Bill Hopkins, off the road, even if a criminal car, for sure, carries a shotgun passenger. No hill in New York, just bumps, but they are still blades enough to pick up cars a few feet. The chased car arranges around the corner and passes the street where a dozen children play. Shots of screaming children scatter from the sidewalk and allow the car to get closer. But once is not enough. The children run immediately back to the street and have to retreat for the persecuted police car carrying Scheider. Once I witnessed a high-speed chase on the streets of Philadelphia. As a criminal, the cops drove through the streets for about 25 miles per hour, stopping at each stop at each stop and red light - a very boring thing compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Speaking of this movie, It's pretty good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were cold. They all dressed neatly. But the movies in New York are dirty. There are garbage and subway cars are covered with graffiti. Shoot outs and beat ups take place in open areas surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in landfills for industrial freezers. Roy Scheider seems to be elegant. Other actors have faces for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging, if not completely unknown. The best on film is the way he captures New York City in his almost total indifference to human corruption and nobility. At the funeral, limousine drivers stand up with their collars, their butts hang from their mouths and kick their cold feet together, bored completely in the ritual. The film wants us to believe that Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable cops who don't stop at nothing to do the job, and here's a little sold out. They always seem to be at risk of doing something unethical and illegal - defeating hell from a suspect or physically damaging a hospitalized and helpless hood - but they always avoid it. (If they did, their characters would become realistic and ambiguous, and we'd rather have our heroes and criminals more biblical.) Very pleasant, even if you saw it before, and you can very well have one of his previous incarnations.
