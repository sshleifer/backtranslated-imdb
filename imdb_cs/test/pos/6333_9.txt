When I saw the film years ago and was disappointed with its wasted potential, when I heard it became a TV series, I completely refused to watch. My best friend immediately became an angry fan, and when I knew I liked horror movies, he couldn't believe I couldn't watch one episode. I told him that the film revealed me for a lifetime in terms of anything BUFFY, and told me to forget that the movie even existed. He insisted on giving two episodes: "One More With Feeling" and this. Both are the reason I am a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was instantly addicted. I've never seen a show with the courage to dare to try an episode that has next to any dialogue, and nothing else could pull it out with a panache and pure BUFFY creativity. I think X FILES could get it if they thought it first, but I'm glad it did BUFFY instead. <br /> <br /> It is for all involved that you are riveted for an hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your seat. And when it was over, I wanted to learn more about each character. So I went out and bought a box in One One. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you have never seen it before, you will want to see more if you do this first episode. The only reason I don't give him 10 out of 10 is that I reserve this score for "once more ..."
