This movie is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock will always remain above the top of all directors of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are sheer simplicity and drama. The next best thing about Hitchcock's films is Definitive & Gripping End. Any thing called "The Man Who Knows Too Much" is less. The camera, acting, dialogues and working with cameras are spectacular in this movie. The song "Que Sera Sera" at the end will remain in our memories for a lifetime. The film is so fun from start to finish that we never know when it will end. Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films, this movie has comic scenes that fit into the film. This film is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
