I saw part of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, but it's over. I bought a DVD to see the whole movie, and I'm glad I did it. Young mother and her two daughters are moving to a house in the area where they inherited from their husband. died of disease. It's a great escape, but the three women make the most of it. A teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies coming out at night. He ignores him, but because he has a nice friend, he joins his group. Meanwhile, a younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and several other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they will attack and kill anyone who is not related to blood. This film was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films I hated in the least. That's why I was surprised that I really enjoyed the movie. The film is deliberately stimulated, which I liked. This allows you to get to know the main characters, most of whom are likeable. Children's zombies have been used at least since George Romero is the 1968 classic night of the living dead. Yet I have found that a tool that uses children's zombies in this movie is interesting. It seems Cardone has finally found the right script and cast. Only the stereotypical scenes of teenage smoking, drinking and parked cars were boring for me. Taylor-Compton also appears in Halloween remake. Moretz appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and horror film Room 6 (2006).
