Slick, tidy, and well-made old school version, how big an international thriller should be done. Determined to shoot the dreaded global terrorist known as "Carlos Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Unlimited", "Space Cowboys"), CIA Operator and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi", " Sexy Beast ") You are a noble naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn," Heart Music ") to become Carlos and use him in a bold plot to make the KGB kill real Carlos because he took the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good, but the film really belongs to Quinn, who embodies (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and cinematographer David Franco provide another great advantage to the film with Hitchcock's tensions and great world monuments.
