If you're looking for a typical war movie, that's not it, so it's a note for all war lovers who are tense bloodshed who are pumped up with testosterone, never mind. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, do not expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It is not a film about people who cause war or who are fighting in war. It is a film about ordinary people who are involved in war and about the possibilities they deal with. Acting, cinematography, writing: all the perfect dozens here. You will certainly appreciate it if you are a Russian like me, but if not, you will probably love it. If you don't speak Russian, check out the DVD RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) version. It's subtitles in about 14 different languages, but English dubbing on this one, which I would say, is just as good. Of course it is not as good as the original Russian track (some things are lost in translation), but as good as the English subtitles. So go look at it, especially when you're studying film in any aspect.
