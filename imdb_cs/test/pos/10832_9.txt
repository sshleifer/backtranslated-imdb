This film goes on 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 clich√©s than it should be possible. But it still works. Brilliant. When I went home from the theater, I tried to find out how it went with the film clips, such as the pages of a new manuscript that blows across the beach or an impossible series of random coincidences, the whole audience rising and shouting: " I've seen it a million times before! But the actors were so charming and screen filled with credible accessories that I forgot to care for. A friend who saw it with me said he had brought him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in Indiana. Overall, a romantic comedy-thriller with subtlety, wit and elan.
