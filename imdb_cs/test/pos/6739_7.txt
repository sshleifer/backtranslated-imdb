This is a subtly fun comedy that comes from a later, more mature period of writing by Neil Simon. Although there are plenty of wisdom that can be circumvented, it is not one of those Neil Simon pieces where every character pours from one joke to one line for two hours, like guest stars on Bob Hope. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some are overkill) that lend some weight to the story. Performances are good overboard, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (though she and Judith Ivey were oddly WASP-ish elections to play Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say that he will come across the right notes as an unpleasant, stupid and utterly horned narrator / protagonist of the story. The film is very similar to Woody Allen's "Radio Days," but the other one is more imaginative and funny than this one.
