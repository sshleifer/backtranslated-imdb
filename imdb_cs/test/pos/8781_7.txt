Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes to the lam, seeking a real culprit. The well-known Hitchcock theme of a man who has been charged with a crime is nicely played in this fun fare, which features "Thirty-nine Steps" and "North of the Northwest", although it is not as good as the classics. There are some impressive pieces, including the final on the Statue of Liberty. The storyline is unlikely and unconvincing, and after an amazing start, steam seems to have run out. Cummings is nice when there is a little lead in the lead. Lane is a blond but not cool variety of later director's films. Supporting roles are generally well played.
