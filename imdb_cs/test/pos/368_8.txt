Aged really well - getting exciting and exciting today. Definitely one of the best Hitch movies. Beautifully shot, with great prerequisite for tension, sex appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman. Due to the great premise, you feel that you have to watch it to the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as a Master of Suspension, I recommend this nice little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
