I remember watching this movie as a child, and I was absolutely astonished to watch TV. This movie has everything for horror movies! This movie had no funny moments to expect a couple of stooge inserts (which was my favorite character in the movie) kevin tenney drove this gem and did a great job with a low budget, i thought the end was an amazing one thing that could stop them by that they survived the night they were unstoppable killing machines! The Effects Made By Steve Johnson We Are Excellent I have recommended this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because like an old saying they don't do this anymore. The sequel was also good enough, but not as good as the original. This is a must have in every horror collection, buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed
