I was about 14 years old when I saw the music version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film as much as the songs I went to the movies several times to see it again and again. My mother bought LP and I learned what happened, just as I did with "The Sound of Music" (which barely know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these critics who have their views is that they have no romantic soul and have seen the film through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he's a fan of Ingrid Bergman, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so big about her? Perhaps the critic did not appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses because he sees the similarity between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story of the film, the philosophy that was the most important and interesting factor, and made the musical in color more fun and entertaining without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It is a pity that many other films with so-called big actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are totally boring in comparison.
