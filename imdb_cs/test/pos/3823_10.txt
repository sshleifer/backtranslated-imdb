When the new external limits began, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to decline, most of the episodes became simply plain ugly and lacking any amusing value. Six episodes here reflect the best and worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Since external limits always preach morality. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the funniest for flops. 1. Afterlife: As an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both bad and paranoid, not to mention simple stupid. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country, and they will listen to their conscience even at a reasonable price! Eventually, foreigners don't have to say a word. Those without conscience are fools to be held in total contempt! <br /> <br /> A really subversive episode! One that should be displayed on the TV screen so everyone can see it! For some it might be a revelation, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our army! Even the end does not justify the means! 2. Theory of Relativity: A good man can be forced to make a split decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of defenseless intelligent beings and at great cost to himself. What makes this decision even harder is its sharp choice: To be abandoned with exotic strangers, with whom you can't even communicate except gestures, or go with a group of people you think will protect you from unknown dangers Though they are ruthless and without compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is great! What drives this corruption is a good old fashion of greed. This episode is one of the most scary accusations of capitalism, multinational corporations, and environmental rape I've ever seen in my life! Unlike real life, there is justice - and fast! One of the most memorable lines is when a ruthless corporate thief said something that would result: "We did the same in the Amazon rainforest war." In connection with the killing of the Amazonian Indians, who tried to protect their rainforests from stripping, it is justification for the killing so far literally in the name of "survival of the fittest". Something Darwin never wanted to take literally! 3. Alien Shop: A huge force can be used for good, even exotic aliens. This power can be used to heal instead of being destroyed. Mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if it gives him enough opportunities. Sometimes it requires a strong cure, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! 4. Grell: An alien can be a figure similar to Christ! In the distant future, slavery can again be justified in the name of purposefulness! In principle, good people can be harmed. Sometimes one has to experience a great shame to see the evil he commits. Children are closer to truth than adults. Those with political power have a huge responsibility! More brilliant work! As a species, "Do human beings learn from history?" Flop Number 1: The Quality of Mercy: Free Lips, Sinks of Boats! When in the war kindly hold your mouth close about important military plans. Gee, I really needed to watch an hour soap opera to find out ?! I was wondering if the outside limit makers had exhausted their ideas, or had the company pulled out a connector? Dark and ugly, it serves no purpose, but despair! Flop Number 2: Behind the Veil: So bad is not moral, but this: When locked in a psychiatric hospital, use some common sense, please! This episode is so bad it disgusts. What X-Files Rip-off! Don't waste your time on this! You'll thank me later! It's a sad comment that Outer Limits went down the pipe to the end of his run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle they were made! Hopefully one day more brave souls will follow the tradition of subversive external limits to the new territory! If you happen to be such a brave person, a good place to start is one unique book: "Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Science Fiction Guide," edited by Neil Barron! For me, the most comprehensive book that has been written on this subject.
