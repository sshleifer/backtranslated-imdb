"Please don't kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It's hard to describe this show. It's like a criminal act. Where's the bad cop ass. Literally. What is great about this show is that some of Assa's are terribly awful. Cracking of these gems like "Adios, Blimp," Assy McGee provides some great laughs in points. Sadly, sometimes the show seems to be pulling at a slow pace, so it's almost impossible to watch them. This is definitely a kind of show that you will love or hate, basically no mediator. It's not the best show on {Adult Swim}, but it has some strengths. It is worth looking at whether you like it. I know I did it.
