Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. Plus, it is set at the end of the 1800s, which is even more interesting. It's an amazing, adventurous story and Alyssa Milano is amazing when playing a healthy, confident, senseless Fizzy ... great model. This is one of my favorite movies. It's a film that needs to be watched over and over again and will undoubtedly inspire and enrich your life. Not only is the story superb, but the film also has wonderful scenery and music and is beautifully managed. This movie is as good as gold!
