These were two videos that Troama had decided were terrible, so the film changed in desperate motion. Maybe the bitterness on Troama's side helped spark the comedy, but for some reason it's a very funny thing with an inspired piece with "Oliver Stone" making a comment during the movie. Lots of portrait, lots of use of lesbian cannibal song HoeDown contributes to fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc. Etc. One of the best Troama publishers. Yes, it is everywhere, I know that going on, production quality or lack, is becoming one of many running jokes. Go with him and you'll be in good time. Behind the scenes, often the best things about the Troam releases, are above average this time. I really think that the anger they felt about these two crappy movies has helped them not to get to them, but to the size, but let them fix this movie in a way that is better than any of the movies how they were originally planned.
