Forget everything you've ever read about the release of Mallachi Brothers "Snakes on the Train", especially if it was a negative review. This movie is much more fun than a movie that will probably tear: "Snakes on the plane." Frankly, I am surprised that there are no more people about this low-energy issue of Asylum. Instead, most of the reviews I read have nothing good or critically worth telling, in addition to the usual stupid herd of idioc mentality, such as acting was amateur, the action was not numerically live up to the ad, and the whole thing was a waste of time. Of course, it doesn't help that the title is a tip-off on the obvious rip-off nature of this movie. Actually, I felt that "Snakes on the train" overcame "Snakes on the plane" for many reasons. First, manufacturers used real, real snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they replaced either a giant fake snake head or a computer created a super-giant snake that consumed the entire Amtrak as a train. How many movies does the snake have to absorb the train? As a result, "Snakes on a Train" is the first film to reduce this height. Second, this low-budget film uses some rough effects. The woman who coughed up the baby snakes - real - was fantastic! The special effects of her forearms, which later tore in the film, were visually appealing! You can also look at the little white girl that the snake eats. She was as cute as she could be, not more than 10 years or so long, and she died screaming all the way as her ugly ol√© giant pan snake head. Not only children at risk, but also a child! This is exactly the kind of graphic material you won't find in 99% of all Hollywood versions. Of course, she didn't eat a real snake, but it's a subversive idea that counts. Third, it is one of those who are cursed on the films where Alma (Julia Ruiz of "The Guy"), the main female character - no heroine - has her curse, which her parents put on her because she didn't marry the man they recommended. As a result, she is full of snakes, coughing up the amount of green cooler fluid climbing then chucks up the snake baby. Imagine Medusa, the mythical figure that had snakes on her hair, with snakes in her belly. Her psycho-shaman friend collects all the snakes coming out of her because she is heading to L.A. on a train to see their relative who can put all the snakes into her and return her to normal. Talk about a broken stomach routine. Get ready for a lot of slime, blood and gore. Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. However, Mallachi Brothers seemed to have filmed this above-average horror film aboard a real train with real snakes and played swaying train movement on the tracks. Fifth, Snakes He crawled for the first hour, infiltrating the train quietly before turning and attacking everyone. In other words, it is tension, tension, tension before people start to die from snake bites. Until the last five minutes, when the snake grows bigger than a train escape and swallows it, "Snakes on Train is Warped, Amazing and Walking. He's Not Editing Attention Deficit in Biglig Hollywood Movie. Hispanic women who have fallen victim to her feminist attitude towards society. Together you have a fantasy gory type, thrilling snakes crawling around the train, and I'm at the top of the top-gigantic snake. because a bunch of other Mexicans bribed the train staff and the Mexicans on board think the girl is so cute that she left her and her boyfriend for free. I think she's better than "Snakes on a Plane" "if you want a hard, small, independently produced horror movie.
