Hi I'm John and I want to tell you that my dog ​​was in this movie on a bait screen that was a pit as one that will bite a man chained. My dog ​​name was Colin and he stayed on filming for this movie. he was also in other matters as a crime track uk and some other small parts. he won several shows, but now he died when I missed that he was a great, real and loyal dog and we had some great times together, but he got a cancer that could not be treated so I had to put him off, it was the worst day In my life I hope it will give you some thing to look for in the movie if you watch it again. <br /> <br /> thanks to everyone
