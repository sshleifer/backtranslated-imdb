Location of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? * Cynthia Gibb lands in the "Gypsy" section of the TV remake <br /> <br /> are some of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say this, except that I thought it was incredibly awful. Mannequin Manners, Bad Reaction Behavior (ie The Empty, Stoic Look While He Co-Star in the Scene Talks) and the Singing Voice That Most Voice Coaches Assess "Average". But she is tremendously beautiful and yet what is a gypsy character? Paying off for her cuz 'look did not cut mustard in a talent department? <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether playing alone or playing Mama Rose, it works one way or another, and I thought for one mind that Rosalind Russell was as exciting in the original as a plasterboard. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect underestimated foil for Bette's over-top-Mama, and it's mid-temperature porridge between Midler's hot food and Gibb stone of cold porridge. Riegart is a real Juuuust. One final holler to the man responsible for the decade comes from Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. Drag queens would kill for glitz and glamor on display here. Everything comes on sequins and bugle beads! <br /> <br />
