GZSZ is Germany's longest-running daily soap and is a cult! I started watching him from day one, and I depend on him right from the start. Over the years, so much has changed, old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia, etc., And new ones have appeared as Mary, Kai, Cora or John. I must say that I liked the GZSZ better in 1995-2000, because today the show is too focused on younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she's the coolest person who has ever been on the soap and is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was great as the first Sonja, but when Tokessa became a revamped Sonja, the character got even better.
