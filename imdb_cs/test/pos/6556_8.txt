Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, but I felt like some of the stories could be sacrificed. There is hardly any character development that would personally separate me from the film, which is ironic because all the puns aside, this film really pulls you into many tiny spiral effects and amazing scene transitions. At first, total cinema threw me away, but as you get used to the overall look, you begin to see the beauty of this twisted film. This is a great movie if you're looking for a searcher with too much stuff or deeper meaning. It's a big horror movie that's not really scary or exciting, but somehow ... scary.
