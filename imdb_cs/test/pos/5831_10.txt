OZ is an old TV series published by HBO. This shows life in one security prison called Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, which is one of the prison levels. Oz has amazing land and excellent cast! There are many characters and almost all are very interesting. Essentially, they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilian, black, Aryan, gay, Latin and many others who have no specific group but deal with many others like Ryan O'Reily. ). The land is very well built, there is plenty of conspiracy inside, lots of power struggles. But all this is not only exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and clever, nothing happens without reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really love this series, and who wants to see something intelligent, very well made with very good casting and performance, MUST SEE OZ!
