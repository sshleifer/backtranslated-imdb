I took my younger niece to an early performance and loved her (I also enjoyed it). I do not have to explain the plot, because the film remains entirely faithful to the award-winning, best-selling book by the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The film takes a popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to a funny man, Luke Wilson and some newlyweds) and great music! I gotta get a CD with Jimmy Buffet! I know the film is good when I get goosebumps at the end. Overall, it was a great family movie that I felt comfortable with my younger niece. I would recommend it to everyone and everyone.
