Of course I am a bit biased, but so far it has been the most accurate display of Marines that has ever appeared on the big screen. I was at Camp Pendleton where I went through training when Webb brought his crew down to shoot some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. It took about two or three days, as I remember. Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and business. <br /> <br /> While filming our short scene, which seemed to be Take your age under 18 - Webb was very conscientious about getting things (maritime affairs) and did a good job with one exception - that scene where recruitment was wearing sunglasses. It never happens for many reasons. I have a movie from the movie and my grandchildren will be bored anytime they manage to sit for a few seconds when I show them their Papaw when he was young. nut and part of the world's greatest combat power (no praise, just a fact). What amazed me was how well real Marines did their acting roles. That was before I realized that DIs must have some acting genes to do their work. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since it's equal to DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and the part is superior to the bad language. When DI was executed, no curse was allowed on the screen. Despite the lack of profanity, it's still a great movie for rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! Semper Fi, Do or Die
