An obsessed love story where the characters were very convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Jackson, who wouldn't be the first character you think of when he was filmed. And yes, during this creation he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci. I can only say that this film should be released in the US instead of thinking it should be a remake. It's just so French, almost perverted .... and yet so true ... this film should stay intact ... it requires the right amount of ingredients to avoid falling.
