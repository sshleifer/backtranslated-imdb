I was first introduced to John Waters films by seeing "female issues" at IFC. I was disgusted, but for some reason I enjoyed it. Then I picked up the Pink Flamingos DVD in John Waters Boxed Set. The film is about Babs Johnson's "The Filthiest Person Alive", who lives in a trailer in Maryland with an obese egg, an obsessed mother, and her terrified son "Crackers". In the film, you will see such sick looks as sex with chickens, drag-queens, people who eat feces, torture and all other kinds of casual humiliation. The film has a soundtrack from the 1960s rock and peasant artists. The only problem is that some parts of the movie seem to be dragging and may get a little bored. I found a "woman's trouble" a little more fun. Rating NC-17 for Explicit sex, violence and distracting images. Enjoy.
