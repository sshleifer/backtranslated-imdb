As I jumped from the film to the film at the SXSW film festival, this movie from the opening evening stayed with me. Curious because it is a dark comedy with quite absurd premise. The family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists in a small community of similar minds are changing car accidents. Three out of four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully open, because everyone receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (I do not damage this scene with peculiarities). The fourth high school cheerleader is not the only one who is physically injured, but also does not change and is now witnessing what has become her crazy, apparently spiritually bankrupt family. Every new moment brings a new outrage, because they become innocently naked and sincere in every way, scare it and then the community. Forgiveness Franklin has the most beautiful sexual awakening between husband and wife I've ever seen Sarah Brightman's song "Give Me," a song that can now bring tears to my eyes. The cast is amazing. Robertson Dean as a dad, Vince Pavia as a son and Aviva as a cheerleader daughter are excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, Mommy asks her neighbor and best friend, much more, more spread out, real character than he could be. everyone in Central America knows Peggy). Theresa Willis shines positively like Betty, Mom. Actors who play three changed characters risk a lot of risks and these risks pay off. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie gets a broad release - if so, I plan to see it again.
