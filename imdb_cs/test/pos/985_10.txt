It was definitely worth seeing for a TV movie. All acting was very well done and the story itself had a moving universal theme. I have never read / seen the original and usually cannot build Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (setting up the Civil War was also very good). Don't expect to see the epic, but you should find it enough to enjoy it. Incidentally (on a side note) do not compare this (or any other film for this matter) with the original work. Films should not transfer the book to the screen, but take a general idea of ​​it and then adapt the story to it. When people say "the book was so much better" (just as they are usually bad), what they really try to say is that book so different.
