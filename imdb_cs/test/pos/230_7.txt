To be brief, the story is thin and you can see the end coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and the incredibly young Phil Silvers keep the film over the water and occasionally lift it straight into the air. Several songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train wreck), but most of them are great fun and Hayworth's scene performing on an absurdly huge set for opponents Kelly needs to be seen to be believed. Another experience is the perfect faux-NYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. Another attraction, if you are thinking about such attractions, is howling the terrible male "chivalry" against women. Oily fun and transparent obedience, which at that time went through a male charm (at least in films), is presented here in the reddish form. Some men are like a wolf cartoon. One of the minor disappointments is Eva Arden trapped in a role so small that she hardly has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
