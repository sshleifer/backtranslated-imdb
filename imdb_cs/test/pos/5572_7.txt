I think that after watching the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get an idea, it shows potential. While many others are borrowed from other shows (what sci-fi isn't these days) and the characters are stereotyped, I love what they do with stories. There is some continuity with plot development and character interaction / relationship building, despite the substantially modular nature of each episode. There have been some scientific related topics explored as well as the character secret / weakness of revelation. These also added some comedy to the show, something I'd like to see more in "serious" science fiction. Overall, this is a good balance that can reach larger groups of people, unlike Star Trek vs Babylon 5, I have been a numerous participant and witness. The visual aspects of the show are more than reasonable and well budgeted for the first season. Acting is acceptable, and I wonder how well actors manage to grow their characters from their written stereotypes. I see enough positives and potential to keep wondering where the show goes ...
