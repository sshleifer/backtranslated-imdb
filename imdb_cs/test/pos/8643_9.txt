Originally filmed in 1999 as a television pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was refused. The next year, David Lynch received money to film a new scene to make the film suitable to be shown in theaters. He did it - and created one of the biggest, most bizarre and horrifying films ever made. The movie really doesn't have the main characters, but if there were the main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi). Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is an energetic blonde who stays in her chin apartment while auditioning for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita lost her memory. He has no idea who he is. Her name, Rita, from the "Guild" poster in the bathroom. So two decided to find out who Rita really is. David Lynch is known to do some weird movies, but this movie is a weird definition. It's bizarre, frightening and totally indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. In 100 minutes the film became very confusing - but if you watched closely, it would make sense. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the internet pointing to things in the movie, I now understand the film completely. Acting is very good. Watts is amazing. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who faces problems with the local crowd. Music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of the best results. And directing - hah! David Lynch is the same master movie director as ever. <br /> <br /> Is this your type of movie? It depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll have to be patient with the movie, and probably watch it a second time picking up a lot of Lynch's tracks left throughout the movie. It's a dream for Lynch fans. "Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, mysterious and masterfully filmed. I love it.
