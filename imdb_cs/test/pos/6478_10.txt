Pat O'Brien had his best role at all as football coach Notre Dame Knute Rockne. From humble beginnings, Rockne joined Notre Dame as a student circa 1910. He is in chemistry but becomes a stunning footballer and hero. After graduation, he teaches chemistry at school but he has a football fever that pulls on him, which makes him give up chemistry to continue his dream of coaching the game. Badly, the school seems to have lost a great chemistry teacher - certainly much better and nicer than the one I had in high school. (Accurate Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn.) <br /> <br /> Motivates his students. He hates academic shortage. He is a coach for all seasons. O'Brien captures the common touch. One of his students, George Gipp, is an unforgettable one in Ronald Reagan's brief short supportive performance. The past years and successes are high, but Knute is still the same kind of coach who testifies to Congress when Football is being questioned. Donald Crisp is excellent as a Notre Dame priest who knew Rockne was destined for football training. Albert Basserman is adequate, but his Jewish accent in the depiction of the priest is at best embarrassing. Basserman was nominated this year for the "Foreign Correspondent" support category. The tragic death of Rockne, in a plane crash, robbed the world for many years of a perfectly professional man. The movie is great.
