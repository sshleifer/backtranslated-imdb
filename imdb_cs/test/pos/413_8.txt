Legendary Hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (beautifully played with the godless sardonic aplomb of Ferda Mayne) dies of a heart attack. Many drama students steal Radzoff's corpse from her crypt and take her to an abandoned mansion to attend. Radzoff returns to life and chooses the brute for desecrating his grave. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane invents fresh, original, and even stylish spin at the usual body counting site, offers a neat evocation of Hollywood's shimmering milieu, and makes a robust job of maintaining a pleasantly hazy and scary ooga-booga atmosphere. Pieces of killer shipments deliver grisly merchandise, with gal being ignited, juicy decapitation (a separate head rolls down right down the stairs and onto the lawn, so a raven can peck away on it!), And another poor girl is crushed with a levitating coffin rating as a definitive terrible peaks. Kudos is also on the verge of stellar casting of famous faces B-flick: Mayne has a delightfully magical ball with his opulent role, Leon Askin contributes a fun portrait as bitter washed-up director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds some classes to the scaly psychic Mrs. Rohmer, plus there are nice bends of Luco Bercovici as a rough drama of student saint, Jennifer Starrett as sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as geeky Stu and Scott Thomson as fool Bobo. Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual police parts and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive shiny look. Jerry Mosely's mood score also hits the shudder. Funny little fear.
