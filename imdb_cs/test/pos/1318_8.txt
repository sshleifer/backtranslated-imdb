The only pure life is one that ends with a blood signature. So Mishima says he's a young protected boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans' most famous literary voices is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army took over the Japanese military base and committed ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks and white), and scenes from his novels ( shown in a dreamy Technicolor set somewhere between the traditional Noh Theatr and the "Oz Wizard." These stories are often narrated at the same time, but are edited to strengthen, the slow linking of Mishima's life to his fiction, to the end (or beginning) when he admires himself as an ancient samurai, he will balance his pen and sword (when his words and actions are the same and he is full) and "pure" beings. Paul Schrader wrote on the screen a game for " Taxi Driver "and directed" Cat People "(a bizarre erotic horror movie that left strange impressions on me as a boy), and in Mishima, he comes closest to do really in What is interesting is to watch a poet, a homosexual, a shy and clumsy man with a low body image that exaggerates his tuberculosis to get out of World War II (which seems to be ashamed forever) to become a body builder, obsessed with samurai, sex, media phenomena, all the while writing fruitful amounts of novels, games and stories. The short and sweet version is to say that Mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and sex. self-harm, in some tragic attempt to feel attached to something greater than he himself, that he was always absent. When you watch him with his fellow suicidal cadets, you see him happy, you publish his great fatherly speech, you give orders and you love control ... until the speech itself, the place where the pen and the sword meet? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the story telling the craft, which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. Although the story, fascinating at times, is really not the greatest success of this film. The camera, performance, editing, music (Philip Glass) and scenography are really worth seeing and more than just a traditional biopic. One day I pick up, up Mishima's book, it seems to have ears for prose and for introducing ideas, but now I'm satisfied with the film. Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should look. Fans of imaginative combinations of facts and fiction should also enjoy.
