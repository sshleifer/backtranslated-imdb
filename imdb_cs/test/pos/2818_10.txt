I like to see a female protagonist, her name was Rose. Rose had a number of interesting questions on her journey. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner fulfillment through external means? Does our company teach it? Can a person be a victim of memory that can lead to the sacrifice of others? Is man responsible for being a product of his own environment? To what extent can you control or take control of your environment? How is a "typical" person similar to or different from Rose? Finally, would the result or story change if he were from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this film provoked me all these questions while I was entertaining, cheering and keeping me arguing to the end! Every time I watched it, I learned more about the film and myself.
