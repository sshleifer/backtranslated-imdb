This movie amazed me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for not interrupting it. John Voight, this cast of little-known black actresses, and especially children, made this a way to spend Sunday night. How wonderful it is to see the early work of this experienced actor as well as the excellent portrayal of Paul Winfield Mad Billy. I don't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is wrong in the role of superintendent. Who would choose? Sharp actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor such as Lane would have had a cheaper role. Cronyn was a great choice for this part. I will consider this movie as a real treasure to keep in mind.
