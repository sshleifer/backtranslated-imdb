For all the murderous junkies, this movie was great! Every character ever at the show appeared in the film. It helped solve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, if you were actually watching the show, most of the pleasures would be lost because the movie made heavy references to every period of the show's existence. It would probably be appropriate as a series finale, as opposed to being a separate movie, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they will do more movies and continue to show signs of murder in law and order.
