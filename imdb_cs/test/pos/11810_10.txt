For all viewers who have seen 'The Cure', they would agree with me on this comment that it is a great movie and is very pleasing. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro demonstrated their stellar quality in this film, along with Dexter's mother (Mazzello) Annabella Sciore. When I first watched The Cure on TV, I didn't know what to expect, but as I watched this masterpiece, it soon became apparent. Dexter is an 11-year-old boy who is plagued by AIDS, sits around his backyard and plays with his toys when one day he meets his neighbor, Eric, who is a bit annoying to two boys at first, but soon become good friends. During the movie I was wondering what would happen to both boys because they thought of me. I wondered how the hell they would get to New Orleans, where they would be sitting at the door with a sea biscuit and pulling out an inflatable crocodile. There were other great scenes in the movie. But the part that came to me was part of Dexter's health getting worse. You just couldn't help but think about doing it, but you'll find out in the end. I was thinking of the first joke they played that Dexter was really dead, obviously not, stupid. But when they play third, something is wrong. Dexter doesn't laugh or show any laughter. At that moment, the victim of their joke soon announces that the poor Dexter has died. I lost it in that part. I pulled my eyes and cried from the scene. You must. When the end is coming, you will begin to understand Erik's loss and then the film will end up on a nice note with Dexters' shoe, which is constantly sinking down the river. Overall, this film was excellent. He has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness etc. When you put it in a blender you get excellent, you have to watch the movie. Peter Horton did a great job and directed this film and I believe it's his best. But for now, I'll try to find this movie on DVD, if it exists. Once again a great movie that will take you to an emotional colleague.
