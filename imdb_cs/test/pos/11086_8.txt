Christopher Boyce (Oscar-winner: Timothy Hutton) surrenders to being a priest and returns home to an uncertain future. When his best friend, Daulton Lee (Oscar-Winner: Sean Penn), is a drug dealer who always has problems and uses drugs a little too much. When Christopher gets a job by working in a secret government site called "RTX". Boyce and Lee both have rich families who hoped to do it themselves. When Boyce decides to take the secret documents out of curiosity to be destroyed. He decided to sell these secret documents at cheap prices to the Soviet Union with the help of his best friend. However, they both never knew how far they would go to seal the living documents and because they were both amateurs. They both betrayed their country for top secret information. The late Oscar director: John Schlesinger (Believers, Eye for an Eye, Midnight Cowboy) made an interesting drama about two young men in the wrong way. Oscar-winners: Hutton and Penn are both exceptionally good in the film. The movie is sometimes funny and quite distracting. David Suchet almost steals the show as a man who works for the Soviet Union. This image has known roles in supporting roles. It was quite underestimated when it was first released. Despite some great reviews of some of the best film critics. This image is actually based on a true story. There are some shortcomings in narration such as these two main characters, but overall it's a film worth seeing. Based on Robert Lindsey's novel. Screenplay Oscar-winner: Steven Zaillian (American gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
