Asterix and Vikings is the first asterix animated film in more than 12 years since 1994 "Asterix Conquers America". He also has the privilege of being the first digitally colored asterix animation to make a very entertaining story more spectacular than to look. <br /> <br /> Each scene of this film is vividly rendered in bright, cheerful shades that stick close to each other. color schemes of comics on which it was based. Character designs also hold relatively close to the comic book, for better or worse, maintaining a simple but unique character appearance. Being simple in terms of character design, it allows more time and effort to be spent on real animation, which by the way surpasses many other great theater animated films. The movements of the characters are very fluid and have a quality that exceeds what usually a modest budget produces; in every scene there is always something that is in motion and no evidence of the usual cost cutting shortening. 3D computer images are seamlessly integrated into traditionally animated 2D art. If anything, the shading style makes 3D elements look more like traditional comic paintings than CGI models. The storyline has a lot of its elements from "Asterix and Normans" comics, and that's where its main mistake lies. As an adaptation of this comic, "Asterix and the Vikings" take too many freedoms with their source material. The long time fans of comics would no doubt find a lot of dislike about the film story and its lack of resource compliance. On the other hand, one can see this story as really entertaining if alone without comparing its source material. Highly comedic, well written jokes are making a positive scenario. The funniest parts were numerous references to pop culture and jibes in the modern life of the 21st century. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are falsely affected. Excellent chemistry and cast (by the way I watched it in English), though a few voices like Cacofonix found it really irritating (but I think it's just part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there is something to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "asterix". This story seems more like Justforkix's story of teenage romance and "coming of age" when Asterix and Obelix only play supporting roles. This gives a pretty great sense of constancy because most of the story elements are the usual core of these teenage movies. Derivatives and clich√©s occasionally, just funny comedy and traditional "Astrix" elements (Romans, pirates, etc.) manage to save this film from falling into simple mediocrity. Although it is not the best installment of the Asterix Animated Film Library, it is certainly one of the funniest, best screenplay and most beautiful animated. DVD seems a bit hard to come though ????????
