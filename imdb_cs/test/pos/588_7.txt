The first full-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle like Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy environment for bright lights (for example, the imprisoned Hollywood agent Dom DeLuis who heard him singing); on the way, he meets Fozzie the Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Cafe that has Telly Savalas for Bouncer and Madeline Kahn Patron!), piano-playing Dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back , a funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in the ceremony chaired by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. All the time, Kermit et al are watched by frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton, sold cars, ice cream and balloons by, respectively, Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, served food by the brazen waiter Steve Martin, almost brainwashed by the mad German scientist Mel Brooks, and eventually attended auditions at the movie mogul Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for the secretary! courtesy of Paul Williams, who also acts as a resident pianist at El Sleazo's. he has recently won four of the following Muppet films and should watch them in the coming weeks when their turnover will be fine.
