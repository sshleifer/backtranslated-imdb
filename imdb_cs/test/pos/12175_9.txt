I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan ?? a cool and fast story that didn't get caught up in detail. These two guys are great to see new ideas. The high quality of the image and the cut greatly supports the film. Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transmit successful Hollywood concepts with local "satire" to our cinemas.
