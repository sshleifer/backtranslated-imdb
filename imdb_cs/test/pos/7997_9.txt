So what is 'Batman Returns'? He was sold as an action film, and many people who saw him think they were watching an action movie - but really, there's not so much, and Tim Burton is hardly interested. People often compare it to the "harsh" superhero comics of the late 1980s, but honestly, if you read "The Dark Knight Returns", it seems a little absurd; Burton's overwhelming imaginations have more in common with the 1960s daily TV series (the penguin rides in a giant plastic duck, in good interest). Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that is a little closer to what we see on the screen; Penguin - deformed, malignant, with tangled history and an underground den - is a Gothic threat dressed in more respectable Dickensian dresses - Udolfo masks like Uriah Heep. But what about Catwoman? She can be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is definitely the twentieth century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all meeting rooms and suites - reminiscent of the romantic comedy of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> And then it clicks. A clever but oppressed secretary who bothered a lone millionaire? Subsequent complications caused by fraud and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is a clearly romantic old Hollywood style comedy, filtered through Burton's S&M dungeon. It has more in common with the 'Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero movies. Like many romantic comedies, they focus on converting heroin; not from the ugly duckling to the swan, but from the mat to the domino. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often notable) career; is iconically sexy because Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vengeful, unforgettable because she knows how to deal with the whole body. In retrospect, however, it is her scene as Selina. Almost every one of them is a small comic gem, especially a look at her lonely home life. It's a finely balanced tragicomic performance, and that's in these scenes that the movie really sparkles to life. Nothing affects me like Selina and Bruce Wayne, who are dancing under the Siouxsie and Banshees mistletoe, a weapon between them that is simultaneously empowered and imprisoned by their alter egos, condemned to conflict. Forget the easy "Big Fish" sentiment or "Edward Scissorhands" gossamer emotions - that's the coolest scene in all Burton movies. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, hatred and not a small joke, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by actors - especially Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding wounded dignity buried under those truly repulsive long-johns. The top comedian thief is revealed as nothing more than a scam; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature exposed to his own, Eliza Doolittle-making make-over (almost literally 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. Max Schreck, Christopher Walken, completes the perfect triptych of bad guys, slips between casual charm and empty-eyed psychosis and disturbing ease (and it's just me, or the Mickey Mouse logo recalls Mickey Mouse? . Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' - a real action movie - was highly praised as the first film that made justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's films, but it would be a shame if we were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.
