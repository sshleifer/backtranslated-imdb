The story of this film is opposed to the most horrific war in the history of mankind: a violent clash between Adolf Hitler in Germany and Soviet Russia, since 1941 -45. The western regions of their country have been thoroughly destroyed, and between 20 and 30 million Russian people have been killed, the vibration of this conflict can still be felt in Russia. Whatever in 1957, when memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black environment contrasts strongly with the subtle and cohesive style of beautiful Letjat shots. His simple story deals with human behavior in times of war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. Everything beautifully tied with a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add really gorgeous gaming and it's easy to see why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the best. <br /> <br />
