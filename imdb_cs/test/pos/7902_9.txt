This is not your typical Indian movie. There is some great sense of humanity, and the characters are quite realistic. There is great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, grief, passion, passivity among many characters. While we see it, one feels that it is a heavy burden of 5000 years of layers and layers of the history of the social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The last scene of an elephant leaving in a rural area was a great reference to this old civilization, yet human relationships are still preserved and nurtured. I saw it on DVD, two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. He was surprised that the film in India was not well done (or not shown) (... but perhaps not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly disappearing and its heritage is not captured by younger generations, because some older musicians in the film no longer live. Great movie.
