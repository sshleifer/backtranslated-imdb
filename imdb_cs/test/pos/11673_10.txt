Penelope Spheeris ("Wayne's World") made its mark with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization", the LA punk scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Most documentary films include punks interviews and concert shots (which often become violent). Overall, we can see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies were in nature, the punk wanted to have as many as possible with the barbed hair and everyone. But we also see how dissatisfied they are and sometimes become skinheads. Anyway, it's really a great time capsule. We are not entirely sure whether we want the desire for this era to desire, or we feel driven away. But this is definitely not a document that leaves you neutral. Really worth seeing.
