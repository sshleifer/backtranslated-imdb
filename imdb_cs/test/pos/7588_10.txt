As already mentioned, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) can be considered the first music video. It was a happy accident resulting from the need for MGM to go for a short film of short films with an exhibit with its length material. They had a couple of fresh young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially threw together a mixture of musical styles in a sort of Norman Rockwell concert in the Park setting. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed of capturing the best collection of pictures from "Odessa Steps" by Eisenstein. It's Sunday when some inattentive people sit in a small wooden band in the park while a tired looking set plays Strauss. The events unfold and the next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. Opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (Kiss) and Garland follows with contrasting "Waltz with Swing". The top blends nicely the two styles into the duet "Americana". <br /> <br /> And must see. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
