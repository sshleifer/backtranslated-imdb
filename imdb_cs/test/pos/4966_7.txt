I wish I met Ida Lupine. When people ask who you might have 6 extraordinary persons of the 20th century for dinner, one person would be for me. I think he is now one of the greatest personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make a great telegraph (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino is the driving force behind many of the fascinating noir films of the 1940s and 1950s. I remember being sad when I saw her shrinking into a terrible role in the horrible AIP movie in the late 1970s. She was bitten by a big worm in the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her when she died long after ... more of the part than the worm. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and Extraordinary RKO Thriller At Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often a producer and lead actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced many timeless noir dramas that are still very impressive to this day. One of them is JENNIFER, which in my opinion is the latest Monogram Pictures copyright movie. The monogram has formally changed the name of the company to Allied Artists in 1953, and JENNIFER has both company credit names. This is an excellent haunted house thriller just as scary as both the Innocents and The Haunting from 8 years later. Really cool and very scary, this little movie is just such a good movie Ida Lupino did and was responsible for. Try to find it ... you will always remember it and how I feel, great admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
