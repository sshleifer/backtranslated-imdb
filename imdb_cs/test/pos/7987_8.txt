First, this film has no story. Obviously, there were a lot of transcripts during production - sometimes the characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, probably because the timeline of the story was never known to anyone on the scene. he said the movie is a bit brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I think it's amazing like Catwoman; She nails the character inherent in sexy darkness and good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken - but even uglier than usual. Devito is not loyal to comic books when it comes to penguin but is good and memorable. Keaton is underestimated as Batman. And music and style are pure cinema excitement. True, the third act does not work. But the last 2 scenes are discarded, and it is clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton should have been in a trilogy that was derailed by the eccentric darkness of the film. That's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and if they acted in the third installment, Joel knows who wouldn't have the chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
