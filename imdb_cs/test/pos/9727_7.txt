Movie B ... B seems to be worth acting and a better message before we get into the big "A" pictures today. Modern films aimed at young women are certainly not designed to encourage the depth of character over shallow self-service behavior ... or to increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not conform to "female" standards. (After all, criticizing fake and flashy like this movie, it won't help sell more products that depend on girls * not * are happy with their natural attributes or inner beauty.) Laraine Day is kind as a mechanically inclined savage who "binds" himself to the rooms and admits to being unable to flirt. He associates with Robert Cummings for similar interests, a shared sense of humor and its honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually gains in value over the superficial "charms" of his selfish glamor-sister (who only presents his own selfish, reckless tendencies to playboy ). Although Laraine is exquisitely outward, it is refreshing to see the inner beauty appreciated more and to portray true friendship that leads to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. I wish young girls (and boys) were getting this kind of news from country to country today. Maybe if Hollywood goes back to making "B" movies again with modest budgets and trying to be happy with modest profits ... what am I saying? To sacrifice a blockbuster mentality to create something honest on a smaller scale would be like expecting to give up a shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares for him. That's a crazy conversation. Please Somebody Think of a Time Machine! I belong to 1940. <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie higher, but the end is too sudden and maybe there is insufficient indication of Robert Cummings's heart change. (I like the fact that B movies are short and cheerful, not bloated and self-confident, but this might need more than 70 minutes.) It was also unrealistic that the widow and little children were so unaffected. sudden death in their family ... or be forgiving the one who caused it. I think it's nice, but a little more mourning or bitterness would be natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice for this family to behave slightly dedicated to their loss has mitigated the effects of this tragedy and made sure we forgive those who are involved in death - because it is actually just a device plot, not a real point of film. Still, it's still weird.
