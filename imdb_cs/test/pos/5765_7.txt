the highest absolute perfection. who says tidal cane comedy is dead and boredom is totally wrong. not that this film will appeal only to those of a male nature. this is another quality British dark comedy with many many jokes that do not involve violence, but it helps when you can let your senses go and laugh at the utter stupidity of it all. This is a real example of a thriving British ingenuity and home talent hats on them. at the performance level, I am very reminded of the early works of Marx's brothers, where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion is present in their acting styles, resulting in a performance where viewers can truly engage in the innate human desire to see others suffer. , yet be separate and still feel safe, much like the principle of many television chat shows. a truly amazing piece of manipulation that leaves all sides better.
