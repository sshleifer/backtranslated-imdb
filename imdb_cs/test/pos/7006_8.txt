Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in a hostile, foreign world against yet hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies are found in their own surviving group. Pitch Black's storyline is quite common and has been seen in various variations several times. But what makes this movie over others is a well-written character. The group consists of very different people with a few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, pilot with heavy conscience; Johns, a drug habit hunter; The Imam, a holy man who faces the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a condemned and killer who learns to value others, not just himself. Characters begin to live in the film. It's not just paper like in many other genre films. You start to take care of the characters, especially for Riddick, although it looks quite strange. He should be bad. In this film, the line between light and black pitch is very thin. All characters are familiar with both. Another thing that works in this movie is casting. Rarely do actors fit well with their roles. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings John the right amount of cruelty and responsibility. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He's doing a great job like Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is quite scary, definitely very dangerous and deep in character, just as he should be. So how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.
