I believe this movie was made for a not so powerful amount of Â£ 8000, but it didn't really show up. There was nothing amateur about production or acting, the characters were brave and real and the place could be some desert area in the world instead of too warm a beach north of Aberdeen. The actors were fairly easy to accept because a lot of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet, none of them seemed particularly friendly, but were willing to fight to keep them alive. There was no great explanation of what was going on, which could really be invented, so lots of conspiracies were left to your imagination more like The Big Empty, which was a movie I also enjoyed. I found myself somewhat warm to most of the characters, maybe even unintentionally fun moments, the men were so common that you felt you could empathize with them and the top of the movie and its end were quite moving. I think Mr. Stirton and his crew should be proud of myself that I've seen worse films with a million budget.
