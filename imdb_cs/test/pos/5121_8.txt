This movie wasn't a great movie, but it was a good movie that you can meet your family, especially children from 10-15 years old. In this film, there are good topics for discussion, such as rapists, the environment, and work to get things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus and the scenery was amazing ... Young actors were great and this is a movie I would expect on a Family Channel or Hallmark channel. With the exception of a few words in the dialogue, the high school could show this film to start class discussion. Hopefully this summer will be presented in Drive-ins to see more people. It followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in portrait performance.
