A haunted story at a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. The Taylan Biraderler (Taylan brothers) made their first shots on a TV show a few years ago, as far as I know. This was a kind of Turkish X-Files, had very nice stories, but lacked visual effects. This time they seem to have had what they needed and used it well. This movie will make you laugh, that it is certain, and it could still be afraid. She has a nice plot and a couple of young, clear actors. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find so many things about you. There are many clues about his story and the end in the film, some at the moment, some will make sense of words, the dialogues were very clever. So these films make the film one of the best turk films made in recent years. Remember that this film is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
