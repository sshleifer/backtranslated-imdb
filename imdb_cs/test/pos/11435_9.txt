When I went to the movies, I didn't expect much. I didn't know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I saw because I was in a small town then. I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a journey through a new industrial China and shows it honestly! You see most of the nasty places of China most of the time and you see what really happens to this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but perhaps people. He's a naive Italian guy who can't believe what he sees. She is a translator from China who lacks her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but always poetic! Beautiful movie with beautiful actors! So only one star is missing!
