Screened this morning for print at the Rome Film Festival, "N - io e Napoleone" is easy to love. First and foremost, he can count on great production values, as he currently has very few Italian films, with a wonderful environment and costumes. The cast is also great. Director Virzì constantly talks about the young leadership of Elio German as "young De Niro". Of course it goes too far, but surely that the boy can act. I loved his performances and did a great job with a Tuscan accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him play in Italian, I hope to see him working in Italy soon. The support cast also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely, but they all did good. Even Massimo Ceccherini, who is best known for appearing in her own moronic films and in serious TV reality shows, is fine and is actually funny. The low casting point was "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Sure, she was a little better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) completely unnaturally in the Baroness Emilia section, using her own accent with a good dose of irony. The screenplay, veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself, is clever, with lots of laughter loud lines and a few very emotional moments. Sure, the end left me confused. The message is somewhat ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you approach, you will find that your hate is, after all, a small human being like everyone else, sometimes amusing, sometimes sad, sometimes deplorable, so it is suddenly hard to hate him; then in the last few minutes he says it would be better to shoot him at the beginning. Personally, I do not like this concept very much. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant film that has so far best presented at the festival (others are fur and scam). My rating is 8/10
