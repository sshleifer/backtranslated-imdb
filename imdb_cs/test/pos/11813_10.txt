The Cure is a fantastic movie about a boy with AIDS. I cried about 4 times and watched this movie and it's so sad. I can't promise everyone will cry, but it will. Very emotional and very sad, The Cure is a necessary film. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love, and it's a superb movie. At first I didn't think it was so great and wondering why my mom always cried and watched. But now I know it's a stunning movie that's so original and so close to real life situations, unlike most other films that make no sense. Words can't describe the size of The Cure, just see it.
