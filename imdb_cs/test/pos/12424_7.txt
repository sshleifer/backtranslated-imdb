In the genres Jeepers Creepers and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man surprisingly well-made - though thoughtlessly - a small horror movie. Throw in a little comedy, nice gore and intense fear. It's hard to say Monster Man is really fun. The low budget seems quite obvious, but it doesn't affect the presentation of the movie in general and put more great horror horror movies into shame. A pair of friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) drive across the country to break the wedding of a woman Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more stupid type, Harley is a self-proclaimed male man and very offensive loud. Adding a conspiracy bonus then took the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things change into a nightmare when they are haunted by a scary face monster truck. When the dead body starts to count, they have to race against the time before their own life on risk. while maintaining tension. Terror is built pretty well, where characterization is never the best, but quite fine. The script also dotted with a comedy that works for funny moments and they pretty nice rather than annoying and also wait for a twist in the finals. It's cheerful and shocking at the same time, which is pretty fun. As a conclusion, Monster Man surprisingly fun. They deserve more attention on the big screen. This proves that a big budget does not create effective horror but skills! Something the director showed and brought.
