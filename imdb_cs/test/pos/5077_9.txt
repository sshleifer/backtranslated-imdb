"I'm afraid you're talking on a stand where men are forced to talk." This Shakespeare line from the Merchant of Venice is once again reflected in the new film Rendition, which introduces the viewer to "improved interrogation methods", a release that began in the Clinton administration and became more common since the September 11 terrorist attacks. 2001. <br /> <br /> The film features a feature cast with Oscars Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles filled with unknown actors also bring, draw the audience into the plot, and show how many people can be hit by overseas terrorist attacks and our means of investigating them. The release is followed by an Egyptian native terrorist suspect (Metwally) who is taken by US officials after his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to an unpublished overseas prison. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) embarks on Washington DC to learn about his disappearance through a family friend and senator employee (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst in an overseas detention facility that monitors violent interrogations. This film follows the emotional criticism of the victim of torture (Metwally) and those involved in it. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by these methods, while others, Streep and a foreign investigator (Yigal Naor), consider it necessary and effective. The film can be described by some as a political piece, but in the end it is emotional. Metwally is the performance of tortured prisoner Oscar-worthy. The film does not intend to preach, but rather ask questions and inform the audience about a topic that often does not have a human face. Publishing was known to work, but it was also known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such a serious business in a way that will affect every viewer differently. The film retains your interest and engages you in each character's character.
