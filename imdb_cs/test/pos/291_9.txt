This is a classic war movie. One of the best, sharp image flashes of flashing lights, bothering the dark background and the helicopter blades morphing into the ceiling fans. Stellar spectacle, great power. Martin Sheen is a mercenary who sent the river to murder the general who was lost. Also along the way are, Robert Duvall like over the top DI with a fondness for "napalm in the morning" or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is a nervous photojournalist with a slanted look at war and his leader. Also in this amazing movie you'll see upcoming stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and watch out for Harrison Ford too ... <br /> <br /> lens is Francis Ford Coppolla, who delivers A movie with perhaps more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather movies, highlighting the war in its most basic form, which is for the most part something you don't see, you can only feel the ship carrying the feeling of war tightening on the river is unbearable. This feeling is rather claustrophobic and really makes the audience unusual. Honestly, no movies ever felt like me. Criticism is hard to find. The biggest qualification of some is that Brando has earned a lot of money for a ten-minute role, but in all cases it is unfounded. They were well earned money, a role that physically limited him, at the time he was an unhappy person, and the role he really created. I can't imagine anyone better for this role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are a few extra pieces of that big man, and I think Redux makes the movie a mile better. <br /> <br /> The final impressions are that if you're lucky, you get the Redux version then you'll be blessed with a totally satisfying movie with a cool 49 minute shot. If not then you will not be disappointed, this film is there with the best, and deserves some great appreciation, and a solid place as one of the top 50 films ever made ...
