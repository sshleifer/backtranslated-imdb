My wife wanted to see this movie and I reluctantly went on. I have never been a big fan of bio - believing that cinema is more exciting when it is not structured in fiction. Besides, even though I love Ray Charles's music, I don't consider myself a fan of his music. I expected to suffer or go through this movie. I was wrong. This is an engaging story told in classic film style. Realism is in nuances - tilting the character's head after a dramatic moment or looking into the eyes while singing. I literally appeared myself in this movie during its viewing. Jaime Foxx, which has been said by many, is at the forefront of the cast of immaculate re-creators not only of time but of ERA, a life that never existed for those of us under forty. This film sinks the audience without the tricks and spectacular panoramas of the Titanic or other period pieces of this illumination. This film is not a musical and musical scene of the 1950s and 1960s that will take you there. This is a film about Ray Charles, but your appreciation should not be limited to the story of his life. This is the kind of movie like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, which does what a movie should do - bringing you to another place, other times.
