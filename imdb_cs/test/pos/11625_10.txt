As an adventure mini-series, it is about as good as it gets. I saw it when it was originally featured on HBO. Sigrid is absolutely believable in his Philadelphia role and the whole production was at first speed! Check out all 400 minutes if you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. Amazing that I can't officially rate it, but I'll let you readers / users know it's a solid 10!
