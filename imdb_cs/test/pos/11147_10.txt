This film is exceptional because Marlene & Raymond is a great performer. The action in this film is the greatest production force, but the script, directing and editing deserves applause. There is extraordinary chemistry that exsists between two stars. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ..... (It's a classic that is comparable to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
