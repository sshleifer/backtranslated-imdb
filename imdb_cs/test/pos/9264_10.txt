I've always been a big fan of "murder: street life," so when I heard the reunion movie came, I couldn't wait. Allow me to say that I was not disappointed. It was one of the strongest 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone again, but the biggest pleasure of all was having Andre Braugher back because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of the great show.
