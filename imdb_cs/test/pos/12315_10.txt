In the press it's one of the greatest stories ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen of this team's father-son, working together, unfortunately, for the first and last time. It is appropriate that John Huston should end his career on a high note by not Bring the work of one of his favorite authors to the screen, in what is easily the best Joyce screen customization. Huston made a career adapting large works of literature to film, usually quite successfully. It is sad and somewhat confused that Tony Huston has largely started and ended his film career by modifying what will be his father's final project and picking up a well-earned Oscar nomination in the process. Once I had the honor to sit in the company of the great screenwriter / playwright Horton Foote, who has quoted this film as one of his favorites in recent years (it was quite a recent release at the time). As a rather prolific screenwriter himself (and a great screen adapter of his own works, as well as great authors such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee) he was apparently overwhelmed with Tony Huston's first time effort, and perhaps equally confused with his lack. since. If someone has an overview of this topic, I would like to learn more.
