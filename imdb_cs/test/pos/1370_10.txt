A crazy Scottish warrior race, stuck deep in space, low on food and free budget, started ten now to three who will help these men crack, with visual effects that suck, but I'm a little glad that weird being when \ t t I met him, then I ran away, but no, if I had Scottish friends, we swore f'n and avoided that fate, so it wasn't spoiled, it was a DVD I'm glad I watched, but if sometimes they did sequel, composed some actors, not all were equal, some were good, with brave acting, some were wooded, and they should wrap it up, but the action kept me watching all, filming, shouting, I didn't stop, tell friends not to be afraid and to watch the next year again.
