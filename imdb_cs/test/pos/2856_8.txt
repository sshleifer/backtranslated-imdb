Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives the life of the soap opera "Reason to Love" as a way to escape her husband and dull life. After a shocking incident involving two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, believing he's destined to marry the show's main character (Greg Kinnear). Sister Betty is a rare thing, a lesser-known movie with an all-star cast and fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprise is an amazing scenario and a place to play. Such a conspiracy calls into question R, but it is fine. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is too graphic compared to the light, fun comedy to come and feel like something from another movie, but it is also necessary to faithfully show that Betty is transformed into a Doe eyed, loving matrix of work happens. When we go along with Betty on her way, director Neil LaBute works some extraordinary charm that makes the film unique and high above your standard swamp comedy bugs. An example would be Betty's first meeting with its crushing. He pours his heart out to him and plays together because he thinks he will attend the concert. While we are aware of the ridiculous character of Betty's ramblings, the music grows when he speaks, gives us, the audience, the Betty emotional perspective. We almost believe what he says, but we understand that her mind is broken. While other filmmakers would like to emphasize the absurdity of the situation to tear every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to her main character and treats her with maximum sympathy and understanding. a chip between Freeman and Rock hitmans is an invaluable, great script that has crafted a clever line on the smart line to bounce away from them. Especially Freeman is as good as ever, slowly moving like his character and blindly falling in love with his own Betty ideal, not even knowing who he is or what happened to her. Again, Aaron Eckhart shows versatility in the ungrateful role of Betty's non-good husband and is almost unrecognizable. Another revelation is Kinnear, whose image of the soap star is not overcooked. There is a tendency to lay bastard on the clich√©s of the celebrity as strongly as possible, and Kinnear defends himself, instead giving him a pompous but limited confidence, despite being a soap star. Soap opera is done so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and what hit the nail on this head with this and good stuff too. If the soap opera were too satirical, much of the movie wouldn't work. Make "Days of Our Lives" spoof as seen in Friends would be a bad step for this movie. The dedication to detail pays off, as the style and sensation of soap opera begins to bleed more and more into the reality of Betty, keeping the overall unintentional comedy aspect of the genre. The scenes on the scene feel real, unlike some movies in which the atmosphere feels so made, you wondered why people who do it for life can't correct it. The pure resolution of the ultimate act, although tad predictable, totally satisfies. It's a pity that after LaBute directed this amazing movie, the mainstream came and called on him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, which is a great example of a person so utterly over the material he was given. Unfortunately, it cannot be relieved of responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Sister Betty, discover her. If you are, it's worth a visit. Sister Betty has a spell that is contagious, even if it doesn't let you think. Hidden jewel yet.
