I am a big fan of this movie and I have found a television mini series "Children of the Dust" that fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more is a cut on the DVD version of this movie. I would also like to suggest to viewers who enjoy this movie to look at the book is a more rounded story with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel, more about Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two different stories for the series or this movie. Sidney Poitier merely shows that he is getting better with age, the talent is constantly growing in chemistry between his character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor was a wonderful tour. I also enjoyed the story of Billy Wirth / Joanna Going, they seem to play well. Of course, Billy Wirth is a "Model of Indian Vision". The appearance, attitude, dream of every woman who wanted to be carried away in one of the native novel's novels. He also worked for me. Much more could have been done with this story, but it allowed the viewer a brief look at racial problems in the 1980s, a white takeover of native teaching, a lack of black pioneers. set cities in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell) as always a great actor comes as a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if "whites" should interfere with native culture. <br /> <br /> For all who love characters and watch them change this movie is for you. I thought the chemistry between Poitier's character and the character of the orphaned Whitewolf was very moving, and he thought that Wirth and Poitier had worked very well together. Billy Wirth has done some of his best scenes when working with Poitier. Sometimes you get nervous when you want to stop her and call her or call her. . But overall it was a great evening of fun. <br /> <br /> Check out the two versions of this mini series if you're a fan that really sees the difference.
