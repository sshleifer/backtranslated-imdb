Maybe people like the devil more than God. Maybe we like the security network for some reason; making a mistake just to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many difficulties that the masses are pouring into the masses, that it is hard not to see the sadness on the faces of everything you pass. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands it all; he knows that maybe everything will not be fine, and maybe he will help someone leave this Earth to avoid the pain their life is waiting for them, the risk he needs to take for someone he loves. Credits are dedicated to screenwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating a lyrical prose about two suburban families that have crossed the paths in good and bad times. Looking at the cast of almost all actors A and B, it shows that the material really resonates with the audience. Emotions do not have to be worn on the sleeve to exist. Sometimes all we want to do is end up suffering. Ryan Gosling brings a table to the table that includes the insides of his characters Leland's emotions. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who goes through BS life and knows what he sees and the worse the better. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those who have been hit by the terrible event of Leland killing his brother with mental disabilities. In this teenager's puzzled mind, he goes into an incident that knows what he's going to do, stops the pain he sees everywhere, but especially on the face of young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake that perhaps playing God is not the work he should do on Earth. Whether this is true will soon be debated because murder begins with a chain of events that finally make sense to the lives of many people when they wake up to the tangible fragility of life. This boy opened his eyes to both grief and rebirth. With terrible ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate frontman Jeremy Enigk, the film will walk through the paths of the small families of two families. the consequences of tragedy. Acting is excellent all the time with a special mention for several. For someone who plays a naive film in most movies, Chris Klein actually does well with so many of the same materials, but also with evolution in man's purpose. His reserve is effective when used in the right, similar to his election success, and I wonder if the directors will let him extend his talent and immerse his teeth in something more substantial. Jena Malone is also effective in a similar sense and plays the role of a turbulent youth like Donnie Darko and Life as a house; Don Cheadle is a determined professionalism that gives us a different approach to the compassionate therapist from the one he did in Manic; and Martin Donovan is brilliant when a grieving father tries to keep his wits together and finally realizes that he must keep his family from falling. It's also great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. When tragedy hits, people get together to get through it all. When Leland points out incredibly in one place, you see how men and women help others and embrace each other when they see the pain and suffering that surrounds them, but after a few days everything returns to normal. The Cheadle character extrapolated the optimistic view that at least we see the true nature of people who want to help and be good to each other, just to be shot back on the retort, "at least in a tragedy." Maybe we don't want to think we're good, because it makes us feel that we should be good all the time and that if it's bad, it has to be that way. By being flawed, we allow you to rebound and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he had for those close to him, and to open his eyes to others to wake up and not let his loved ones move away from them. One cannot focus on the sorrow of others when one has to deal with oneself first. Hoge created a parable for this and really effective piece of film-making with hopefully many more to come.
