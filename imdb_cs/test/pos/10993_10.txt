In the wilderness that Hollywood Productions has become late, this film - itself - is really "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! In what can best be described as a "cute" movie, about 350 years of film actor experience (okay - give or take 100 years!) joyfully lights up the screen to tell the story of ruse, remorse , and the redemption of Catholic families in Buffalo, NY. This quiet little independent film from Burton Sisters 'FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY from Burton Sisters' Fault Siers, which is well placed to take its place in the genre of "Feel-Good" leaving a smile on your face and joy in your heart, all while renewing your faith in humanity. From the spectacular scenes of Buffalo, NY scenes to final credits, the film tells a story that could be told about any family anywhere. However, in some way this particular family gathering and "family association" in a small, indescribable house in Buffalo more than fits into the law. If you have never been to Buffalo, you will leave the theater with thoughts of "shuffling" to visit! The shots of the city's sights and landmarks contribute to making the film curvy, except for the earth's tone that suits it. The calm beauty of the "Great Lakes Royal City" rejoices, rather than distracting from the story that is being told. If only a few films took advantage of the natural beauty of the "other cities" of this country instead of escaping to the sound scene somewhere, the final results would be much more believable. Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble again prove that real talent outweighs Hollywood 's taste anytime! <br /> <br /> GO TO KNOW THIS FILM! You've been through the Hollywood desert for a long time!
