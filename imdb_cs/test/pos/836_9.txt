Since the last couple of days I am really addicted to the "Scorpion" series and I'm still hitting myself over my head because I waited until now? which is too long? before you buy the whole box. "Beast Stable" is the third great effort in the series, and the undisputed core of this series is how writers have always come up with something completely new and different for each installment. Never before or after, there was an exploitation series that offered so many varieties when it comes to stories, settings, themes and movie styles. The original is more or less qualified as the so-called "Women in Prison" swing (but already atypical), but you cannot categorize sections 2 and 3 as such, because there are hardly any shots in the prison walls. And the overall tone and atmosphere change with every new episode as well. The first film was rough and harsh, while the second was psychedelic and the third was almost mainly melodramatic. Don't let this latest description discourage you, because "Beast Stable" still represents more than enough exploitative topics and disruptive shots despite the dramatic environment. For example, the opening sequence is absolutely fantastic. Sasori, still a refugee by law, literally kicks the way to freedom in the subway when there is no other way than to cut off the hand of a permanent policeman who has bound her. Her ride through the city with her shoulder hanging off her side, while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by a well-known theme song, is simply pure and real exploitative gold! The story continues convincingly with our heroine, who desperately tries to lead an anonymous life in the city, but the poor thing simply cannot escape the past or new types of suffering. Sasori befriends a prostitute, but without exchanging dialogue, and takes a job in a sewing studio. Her own retarded brother (!) Impregnates a prostitute, while Sasori gets into trouble with a local network of pimps and underground crime. Cleverly preventing a criminal from using his body, he met a former prisoner of enemy, and avenged one of the prostitutes fiercely when subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, an armed cop continues the obsessive campaign of streets and seeks retaliation against Sasori. Our talented director Shunya Ito impulsively crosses all these storylines into a powerful healthy one and never loses sight of the visual aspects or thoughtful film style. "Beast Stable" offers some of the most impressive compositions and sophisticated camera angles you can imagine, adjustments are flawless, and exterior locations effectively depress. Those who know Sasori's character are somewhat aware that the film really lacks unforgettable dialogues, but this always gets pretty much with the amazing Meiko Kaji on the screen of the charism and the gruesome grimaces. There is very little sleaze, except for the above-mentioned incest, but brief flashes of extreme violence are amazing, and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words. In fact, I think the third part might be the biggest (or at least my favorite) series so far. My only small and irrelevant point of criticism is about the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked in a cage. The bird sounds like a ventriloquist dummy with stomach cramps.
