watch this movie. it's a really good ride through the difficulty of making an independent movie, and what happens when it blows up the film's creator. There are a lot of things about punk rock and the philosophy behind this movement and it's a relationship to this project. so if you are in old punk, american punk, you will kick it .... but beware, there are a lot of bad game bits from a failed project that is incorporatedâ€¦. And in fact, some of the best parts are listening to people who never participate in the film making pontificate and what they have gone through during the three-year period that it took to put it together. So anyone out there who is going to make a movie, especially if you weren't at the film school or working in the field, should look at it and learn from the mistakes of the filmmaker.
