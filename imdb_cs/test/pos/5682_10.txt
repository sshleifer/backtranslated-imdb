I have read many unflattering comments on this film and all I have seen is that they all have in common: "boring" and "unrealistic". First, they used a real frickin 'Crocs! How much more realistic can you get? No CGI, no animatronics, no miniatures. Just a crocus and a piece of meat. Have fun, guys! There's no doubt that this movie will get a slow start. The evolution of the character, what they have, anyway, will take a little time, and I think it's primarily where this film lacks. But when the movie starts running, I find the action has risen dramatically. I don't want to say there's a lot of actions. If there is something, there are more moments when croc cannot be seen at all and people just wait. However, we know that there will be no relief, and that the crocodile will only shorten its time. This had a similar frightening feeling to other films that achieve their horror through non-action, such as Open Water (another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being "boring"). Personally, I think viewers who feel unable to feel tension have had surgically removed attention at birth, but it's me. Finally, the characters feel real and the situation is that in reality it could happen to anyone in the right circumstances. In addition, deaths are quite real and sometimes it is a bit difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> All in all, this winner is the winner.
