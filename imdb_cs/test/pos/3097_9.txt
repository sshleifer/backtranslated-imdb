The famous filmmaker Werner Herzog's "Fata Morgana" is incredibly unorthodox. Although characters appear from time to time in the film, there is no real story. The film is neither an educational nor a historical documentary. It is a film without an accompanying scenario. The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical VO story, the combination of which overlaps a vast array of images from predominantly, though not exclusively, the Sahara Desert. . Some images are amazingly strange and unusual. The camera captures scary images or wonders, optical illusions that bother and fascinate. For example, in one sequence, a man with glasses gives us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what was the most interesting and bizarre succession for me, the small embedded room includes a man with dark glasses who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the microphone he uses, accompanied by an old lady who plays a meticulous melody. old piano. It seems that neither the man nor the old lady enjoy what they do. How baroque. "Fata Morgana" has a basic concept that combines a wide range of strange images and eclectic sounds. But the concept is so soft, so opaque that you will never be without it. From this subtle theme, film really makes sense. However, without this reference point, the film may seem tedious and endless, a nonsensical show of earthy random images and esoteric narrative gibberishes. Unintentionally superfluous, thematically confused and cinematic heretical, "Fata Morgana" will probably either make you daze with pleasure, or cause you to vomit. Either you follow the quality of Zen's movies, or you'll be tempted to break the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers agree: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
