My end at the end. Bobby died in his father's step. Mike tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could have thought it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died ... Mike survived as a child by creating an alternative ending in his mind ... as Bobby left ... Mike made a plane that flew Bobby out. Children who are sexually and violently abused often create other worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also great to see my old living. We called it San Jose Boulevard and lived where these houses were filmed. It was so weird when I saw them filming inside the home ... not the studio ... It was my kitchen, the bedroom and the living room. And those hills ... we use them for a trip like kids .... we look down at our little valley ... see glimpses of the bay. It was a real nostalgic trip for me.
