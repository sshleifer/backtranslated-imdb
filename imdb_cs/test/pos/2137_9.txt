I'd like to go to the museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the main composer, Michael Cimino, and this fabulous art that embodies the light. Vilmos Zsigmond. As I said, I'd like to be in heaven to discover all the creatures that this man can apply to one frame. Imagine when you can see this artist's moving image. I can say: this film is one of the best.
