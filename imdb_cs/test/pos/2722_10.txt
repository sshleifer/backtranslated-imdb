From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen really traveled a long way. If the first one goes in history as a pure curve, it will surely carve out a special place as a "mature" film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can't imagine being excited and moving at the same time. She is thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in serious situations that are reflected in a sensitive situation and move in sensitivity throughout the film. It is not a film that makes you feel "tchh tchh, how difficult life must be for schizophrenics," but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen has done a great job by emphasizing this supreme reality of our existence, that we are all trying to live in our own world, in which we think we are trying to live after miracles called happiness, peace, satisfaction. Along with the depiction of the vicious mind, Sen's magic has brought many small nuances of human relationships because they maintain stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose peace, break up, make bad choices, pursue guilt, behave selfishly and so on, is captured with extreme dexterity by Sen. She showed the cruel dilemma that Shabana had to deal with all her life, having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with her husband and children for herself. And in always being beside her sister, she was always a strong personality, providing support, making judgments, and so on, unknowingly interrupting the part of oxygen her sister needed to flourish. Isn't it a very cruel truth that sometimes, in an effort to do the best for someone, we strangle their assertiveness and ultimately hurt their self-esteem? Of course Konkona and Shabana deserve laurels as always, because the ingredients were not so good that food could not be so special. Aparna Sen has once again made a masterpiece of film for those who long for some "food idea". Bravo!
