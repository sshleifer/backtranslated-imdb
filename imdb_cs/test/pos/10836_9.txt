This was recommended by a friend who said it was cute and cuddly for "Lesbian Sexual Flick". The boy was wrong. I think he just didn't get it. Growing up is not understanding and then discovering yourself through trial and tribulation is more like that. The characters are full and lively and the story has plenty of fun thrown through a theatrical performance to make someone interested. Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so many attempts to find the love he desires, just to find out he's the only person who's afraid to reveal himself, and has run away. Johdi May as "Flo" was remarkable. He spent a few hours trying to remember where I saw her before, just to find out he's a Silent Sister "Alice" in "Last of the Mohicans" Fortunately, I was raised in a liberal family and had no trouble trying to film like that. So many people are missing on such movies. I'm glad I took my friend for advice and tried it out. But I'm sure I liked it more.
