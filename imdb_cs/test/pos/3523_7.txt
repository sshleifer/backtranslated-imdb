Mountainous forests, young happy campers, park guard warning and lurking figure. The folders are here for horror pleasure, and director / co-writer Jeff Lieberman does adequate work to achieve this goal. It is a formative forest horror, but for most part, execution is at the top of the game and the story (which is fundamentally fundamental) is effectively said in a certain realism. Maybe a little more exposure wouldn't escape, but Lieberman's craftsmanship will take care of material defects and typical details with increasing tension, moody visual effects and a choking atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very ominously persistent score. Whenever a very creepy whistling crept into it, you painted a really uninteresting feeling that settled in a beautiful background. Dean M. and Joel King also do remarkable work. There's a lot of style, even with a minimal range and increase in slow grinding. Occasionally, stimulation can become a stop-and-go issue. It's not particularly violent, but it is still clear that even if something happens from the screen. The second pursuit scenes and escalating fear are well done because it has darkness that comes alive with its noble killer and gets actor George Kennedy riding his white horse in a mild but beautiful turn. There is a nice bunch of performances; Deborah Benson does for a strong, lively heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell round off the modest cast of credible deliveries. The final peak is rather twisted, but the end is one of those types that let you think? "Is that it?" Well etched ass slasher item that probably plays it a bit too safe to really distinguish it from the norm.
