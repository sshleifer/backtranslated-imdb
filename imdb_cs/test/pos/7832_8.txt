OK first if your not a fan of the whole low budget horror genre then don't bother with it. You really have to be a fan to get a gag. The movement is essentially about snakes .. on the train. Lots of them. There's an ancient curse and a crazy ending that I'm used to spoiling. Gore's effect is full and real icky ... but the movie is mainly one big bloody gag about snakes scares hell out of a bunch of people trapped in a train. The tension is built up well and there are some unforgettable and well composed scenes .. some of the acting is a bit of a hammy (watch on surf dudes) but it's not really a point ... Give this movie go. Know what to expect and not regret!
