It's just ridiculous how this film is underestimated. It's one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. It never lags behind, never slows down, it's a movie that has an amazing flow on the plot. This along with brilliant writing is an amazing movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveen and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti bring great bad comedy, but Viju Khote and Ajit-wannabe are best with their stupid intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy the movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you won't regret it. Most Indian movies will rip me at the end because they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ended because it's a great movie.
