There are a few cartoon movies where animals or something "is not human" portray human beings and I think this film is one of them. In addition to several points of plot and character - this film could be changed with all people rather than with animals. Although - it's good that somebody didn't - I feel like cats are happy in this movie and they show people! This movie also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is somewhat strange for Disney's movie. He presents alcohol *, shows a dog who teaches another dog how to attack "people crossing", and shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O 'Malley, who is surprisingly human and adult. br /> <br /> Like a cartoon - or just a movie in general, I feel it's pretty good quality - the story and characters are particularly good. The film (in general) takes place in France and you meet the family of cats - the mother of the Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You will also meet a kind (rich) old woman who loves cats, a servant of Edgar and an old man (who has lost his balls to CLEARLY) called George. A love old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar, who hears what she gets from the will she will have after her cats have it. He is INCREDIBLY with him - and he has a bad scheme ... <br /> <br /> A very cute movie for every age - enjoy "Aristocats"! Doesn't include "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and a few others that I can't think of right now.
