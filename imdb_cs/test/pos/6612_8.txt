I saw this movie at the lowlands festival (23, 24, August 25) after my friend said it was a very cool movie about skating history. I didn't expect what I expected from this movie. It was recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do some great tricks, or it was a skating documentary. So I went in, unpacking all expectations after waiting for about an hour. This movie is really a nice piece of work about starting skateboarding. It started with the zephyr team, where there was a great group of surfers. This takes place in a not so pleasant space in which to live. So try something else. Skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the zephyr team at the time, you are where you are one of the best guys / girls. Because many people have seen an escape from where they lived with the zephyr team. Now they tried all the new skateboard tricks. At no time was skateboarding popular again. There were several competitions and one national competition. The zephyr team participated in several competitions as well as national competitions. But what they did on skateboards was incredible. But the jury has not done how to judge them. So they put the whole world of skateboarding on his head. Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the movie / document, but you have to see this with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the atmosphere of this movie. This movie gave me a lot of style, so I rewarded it. <br /> <br /> Greetings from the gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.
