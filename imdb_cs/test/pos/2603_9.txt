Four road signs say "If you're looking for fun ..... You don't need a reason ... All you need is a gun ... It's a period of rabbits!" There are hundreds of "Rabbit Season" inscriptions on every tree in the forest. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who hangs up all these signs? Daffy Duck! Daffy delivers the last sign, the tip and tells us, the audience: "Reluctant, I know. From then on, we see Elmer Fudd, a shotgun in his hand ... and a semantic war between Bugs and Daffy and Bugs every time. Only in cartoons, thankfully, we can see someone shot in the head five times and beyond!
