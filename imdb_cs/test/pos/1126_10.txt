... I can't believe I was instantly addicted to this show when I saw the first scene I was deep in. By the way, first and foremost, the guys are hot, Cappy, Evan, Calvin, Fischer, Cappy, Heath, Cappy, etc. <br /> <br /> and they are not afraid of being called bitches. I like it. At the same time, it doesn't mean that it means greed and greed, just realistic. Third relationships are so great, especially Casey and Cappy. Recently, each show has turned away from the original journey and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season. Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love, a kind that lasts. They loved each other over the years and did not end when the guest star appeared. In today's world, it may be incredible for two people to love each other for a long time, but that happens. And people in college are defining each other, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in school with. Like Casey and Cappy. I hope there are many more seasons of this show and I hope we can see the relationship between CASEY and CAPPY NOW that they will be PROBABLY STAET TOGETHER, Thanksgiving ...
