It is really not so bad for cheeses from the late 1980s. There are plenty of pretty funny one-liners ("That was a great theft!" - "Thanks!") And Madonna gives a good performance; nothing that would be good, but it's Razzies and the Oscars. I wonder if the film would be better accepted if it used its regular (pre-British influence) speaking voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used instead. Oh, good. As a side note, I met one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops with their work; He said it was a fun movie to work on, but he gave me a sad news that the actor who played Buck, the one who delivered him, died about a year after who he is, the girl.
