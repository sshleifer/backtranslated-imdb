There were at least half a dozen silent movie versions of Shakespeare's "Trader of Venice," and there were several television productions. However, no one has ever made a big budget play to play. . . until now. Given the nature of the game / most memorable characters, Shylock Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little inconvenience that appeared in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have subdued film enthusiasm. Of course, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to give Al Pacino a chance to scream, beat, sail, murmur and torture - all of which are pretty good. Like Richard III, Shylock's role is a dream that's weird. It's ridiculous to talk about Shakespeare's anti-Semite because he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely to ever travel abroad. On any level, Jews could also have been a mythological race to him. While Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play is definitely. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably suggests the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is the 16th century with the unmistakable diction and cadence of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with crawling about the miserable terror of the Jews and then at Shylock (Pacino), who just stood up, admiring his own business. It will buy it when it comes out on DVD, certainly! Sarge Booker
