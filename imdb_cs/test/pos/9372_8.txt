"Crossfire" doesn't remember much because his three stars had the first name "Robert", but as one of the first anti-Semitism Hollywood movies. The story opens with a murder in the silhouette of a man we later learn to be a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). Police Smoking Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is assigned to the case. Ex-soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan) arrives on the scene of murder and we learned through flashback that he had met Samuels at the bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being excluded from World War II. According to Montgomery, he and friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) to the Samuels apartment for drinks. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell first left the apartment and that he and Floyd followed suit soon after Samuels still alive and well. Finlay is unable to find Mitchell and suspects him of murder. Accepts Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him find Mitchell. Mitchell meanwhile thought about the streets in a dazed state. She meets Ginny (Gloria Grahame) at a bar and makes friends. He gives him the key to the apartment and goes there to rest. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) looking for Ginny appears. Mitchell, still in daze, walks away and goes back to Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all-night movie house. From Mitchell's perspective, we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably a murderer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery, who is trying to prove his guilt. He arrangers having one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) set a trap for the Mongomers. "Crossfire" is considered to be one of the best genres of "noire". In fact, he received several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame, for Best Actor. It was made on a modest budget for about three weeks. <br /> <br /> Has all the elements of classic "film noire", shadows, low key illumination and the story plays mainly at night. The requested femme fatale is Grahame Ginny, who plays a smaller role, but it's your classic "femme fatale". An unnamed character, played by Paul Kelly (in a great piece), was chewed and spit out Ginny and wanted to do the same for Mitchell? Robert Ryan steals the picture as a brutal Montgomery though it would write it in similar roles for years to come. Robert Young makes a good low key detective, but Robert Mitchum has little to do but make friends with Mitchell. Others in the cast are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who would go on the following year to play "Tarzan") as one of Mitchum's mate soldiers and Richard Powers (who was formerly known as Tom Keene) as the final assistant. br /> <br /> Director Edward Dmytryk would soon go to The House Un-American Committee because he has communist relations and spent a few years in prison.
