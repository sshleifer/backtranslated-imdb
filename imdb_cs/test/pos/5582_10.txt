Not many TV shows are attractive to as many different fans as Farscape ... I know that young people and 30/40+ are flying, fans of both men and women in as many different countries as you can think of adoring this televizi miniseries. It has elements that can be found in almost every other show on T.V, a character driven drama that could be made from an Australian soap opera; yet in the same episode it has a science of fact and fiction that would even give the toughest "Trekkie" run for his money in brain stakes! Wormhole Theory, Time Travel in the Real Equation ... Magnificent. It includes cultures from across the map because the possibilities are endless with more stars and therefore thousands of planets choose. <br /> <br /> With such a wide range; You could expect nothing to hold on to illusion for a long time, but here's where Farscape really comes into its own element ... It's successful where everyone else has failed, especially those who like Star Trek (universe) with virtually zero element Kaos!) They got them ideas very fast + kept them! Over the course of 4 years, they manage to keep viewers' attention through good continuity and continuous development of the multi-thread character for each episode with unique personal camera contact that is specific to certain groups of characters within the whole. This structure allows an extremely large area of ​​the subject because loyalty is forged and broken in many ways to many many questions. I saw a pilot (Premiere) when I arrived, and I had to keep tuning to see if Crichton would ever "Make a Girl" after seeing them all on TV, I was glad to see them on DVD and I got to admit it was the only thing that kept me calm when I had to make a 12-hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that got me through these extremely long nights ... <br /> <br Do yourself a favor; Watch the pilot and see what I mean ... Farscape Comet
