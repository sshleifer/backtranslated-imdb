This film, which grew up in the era of a typical fund and dealt with office politics, and the men who were willing to hold a banquet of beautiful meals every day will hit the film. Good afternoon. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this film to challenge Suzy Parker, the basic GORGEOUS. Everyone wanted to be, and I believe it did well, and over time it rose. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and late Stephen Boyd. It may not seem that any of this is plausible, but in fact it was and probably is still fear of sexual harassment. I thought the movie was well occupied, except for the horrible actions of Evans. But what lubricating ball he found his niche somewhere else. Otherwise it all came to the board.
