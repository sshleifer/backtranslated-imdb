I enjoyed, appreciated, this movie will be seen again because I'm sure I missed that I missed it. Wonderfully cast, not through playing or Clich√© performance or plot. It uses a tragic event that reflects multiple relationships, as those involved in every relationship, connected (or disconnected) and perceived life, what position everyone occupies in relationship, life and how they deal with confusion, joy, injury and disappointment . finding that things are not what they perceive. At first I thought they were "observers" and "observers", but that's not the case, we're all connected and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend the movie to everyone, especially those who are involved in teaching, social work, religious counseling, and every other person who breathes.
