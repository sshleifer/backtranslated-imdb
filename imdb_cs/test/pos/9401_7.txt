I recently rented a Twister, a movie I saw a few years ago on TV, and I did it at an age; I found myself laughing at it several times and how weird all these people were, and I took care of them deeply. This is the little movie that is made for a cult audience because it's more like Howdy's gazpacho (well, I think that's what it is), it's a taste: you have to be tuned to your special wavelength. Production values ​​can be charitable called cheap and tempo and the atmosphere takes a while to settle, but the film has a "look", especially in some beautiful shots that contrast with the dry flatness of the country with the wealth of wealth. lock interior: Michael Almereyda had a good eye even then. Living with sodapop tycoon Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two adult children, grandson and housekeeper) seems to be a bit apart from life beyond that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is amazing (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as headless siblings of the brilliant son Maureen and Howdy), who after a while occupy their roles so comfortably that they buy a strange premise that somehow survives a tornado and apparently incapable. Happiness, these people are lucky, yet they do not know what to do with their happiness. There are some really great scenes: Eugen's sudden confrontation first with his gold-kicking baby television host girlfriend Virginia (sour pert Lois Chiles), then with his kids; William S. Burroughs with target practice in the barn and telling a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's friend Chris, who proved himself by battling a full wasp shed, wrapped in a tablecloth and napkin, and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris all sit on the couch (the last three in suitably light summer dresses, the former in a red jacket and black leather rock'n'roll gear) staring at the paintings on the huge television and contemplating the Future (the images were made by Bill Viola, who created the video installation background for Nine Inch Nails' last tour). Crispin Glover is as predictably spectacular as Howdy: as always it remains perfectly in its nature. Howdy made the cult of his suffering and brilliance; It's like Oscar Wilde of Kansas and trying to live in the suit of his red velvet. Whether helplessly throwing an electric guitar, breaking in a full black tie, wearing a black cowboy gear, demolishing a room or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the soup from the blender, it's fascinating. If you like his work, you'll like it.
