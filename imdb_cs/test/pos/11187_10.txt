A group of evil businessmen must knock down a building to build a huge complex but cannot remove tenants. Tenants and entrepreneurs with their hired criminals clash until the film ends with one of the funniest battles of all time! The gee-haired guy who goes "eeeeehhhh" every time he throws a blow and the other who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting, just to be beaten off the camera, will make this substantial observation if you want to laugh rather than with them.
