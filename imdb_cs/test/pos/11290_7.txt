Although the film doesn't matter, it's a myth of creation. God (a fragile, bloody figure in his chair) cuts out his organs with a razor and dies in his own dirt. The Earth Mother grows out of a corpse and impregnates with her seed that gives birth to man. However, it is very unlikely that you can read it without first reading the synopsis, and this is not particularly important to the film you are making, because it is rather a surrealistic work of art, all in black and white, inks. Sick, bleak atmosphere is created with sharp photography and minimal sounds (mostly dripping water, moans, scratches, etc.), but every scene goes a bit long, as does the film as a whole. It could have been great as a short film, and the scene that killed itself was excellent and extremely horrifying, especially the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it takes so long and you don't. You know what you see most of the time. Yet there is a good film for original style, pictures, atmosphere and content.
