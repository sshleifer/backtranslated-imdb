Why is it better? Because it's a faithful dark comic vision. Because images are inventive and unlike the first one, there are real moments of fear and pathos in this. The first one had too much Shtick Jack Nicholson, excessive Prince music and an unpleasant "romance". Here, instead of one villain, there are three. Not Robert Wuhl, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 attraction of this movie. Her transformation is what drives a running theme, meets at the edge of common sense and madness, good and evil. It becomes really creepy. Costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVit Penguin is inspired and desperate, not just a nut. His circus gang position is one of the comic relief elements (except the giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I have eased, Walken is quite clumsy as a ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score is perfect fit as usual, and Siouxie and Banshees song ("Face to Face") is easily the best of all the songs of any of the movies, the perfect match of the musician and the film soundtrack. Least campy movies, it is creepy, does not fall and requires second and third views as a theme park ride. Bravo Tim Burton and the Cast!
