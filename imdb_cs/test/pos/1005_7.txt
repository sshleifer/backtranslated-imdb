In this TV special, Jon is the one who needs life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. With this forever dissatisfied, Jon takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. How many people will be interested in loner 20 who is the best friend, cat? MC Hammer in the Office (Disco is Dead?, Says Jon), is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is just like him. Of course they'll get on, but Garfield is afraid that John will forget about him and he'd rather have children for a cat. Fortunately, Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With smoother animation than past TV specials, it feels like a longer episode of Garfield and friends.
