Now I realized that most of the people at that YOUNG WARRIORS garbage or greet them as "so bad it's funny" type of entertainment, but let me make something clear: It's actually a quality piece of low rental event if you're willing to follow such cinema without critical eye. In fact, it is much more fun and provocative than most 80s action movies. The key is the theme of the film. I am always crazy about films that deal with the subject of vigilantism, especially when they are ambitiously exploring the psyche of participating characters. YOUNG REPRESENTATIVES may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first one had both of these elements), but trying to be different from the Cannon movies of the season period in that it's really unique. The story is simple (don't worry, it won't be spoilers): A group of college student jokes are changing their paths when one of their family members is attacked by a tough street gang. Students embark on the streets to fight general street crimes because they don't know who the gang is responsible for. They eventually gain some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and hunt the night fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; they are vulnerable, inexperienced novices who make considerable mistakes almost every time they go to clean up the city (usually with their frat mascot in the lift). Finally, they find out who the gang is and follow them, but by then you will not expect a standard climax in which good guys leave unscathed. One thing about a movie that has struck me strange, but still effective is that most of the first acts offer no indication that we will later see any action or violence when treated like a goofy frat the comedy you would see at the American All Up Night event (where I believe it was at one point). Actually, the comedy line lulled me to forget that the VHS cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back. When violence finally comes, it's neither fun nor cute ... it's a shocking concern. From then on, the film becomes a thoroughbred, uncompromising action yarn that contains some surprising firefights and gore. Acting, though nothing special, is much more passionate than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives his and his appearances surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is equally invested, including always reliable Ernest Borgnine as the father of the hero's father. Cinematography is also par and action scenes are processed with such rigor that I did not personally expect them. I understand why some people thought this film was worthless because its part is extremely high dated, but these aspects hit me in their own right. Van Patten is an animationist and probably in the early 1980s working in a style that is exposed in several scenes, a psychedelic wet dream of a retro film lover. I'm sure most current viewers will quote those moments as low points in the movie, but I disagree. Also Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which sounds like it could only be recorded in '83 - seemed particularly appropriate and enjoyable, no matter how old it seems. YOUNG THINGS ARE ONE OF MY MY LOVE Action Movies from the 80s and I urge all those interested in the genre to look. Sadly, it's just been released on VHS since this writing, and it's not shown on television these days. A nice DVD presentation would make me a moon-walk around my living room with such intensity that I'm sure my ankles would swell. Meanwhile, I ask you all to go to Ebay or Amazon and cough ten bucks or anything on the old big boxed tape. It's really a remarkable core of ambitious cinema.
