FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. He played Edward G. Robinson and was a very brave story about slim newspapers and their will to do anything ... sell newspapers. In particular, the old story of an innocent woman is plastered over the pages and helps destroy her now happy life - many years after she was unintentionally involved in the scandal. The reason I loved the movie so much was the fact that it was steadfast and did not pull any blows - showing how low the publishers can sell papers. Here in the movie against the world it's a FIVE STAR FINAL remake - with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, this film is played by Humphrey Bogart and he is the head of programming on a radio station, not a newspaper. Otherwise, the story is basically the same - except that it is a little less irritated and lacks some of the original sands and sensations. That doesn't mean the movie is bad - it just doesn't pack as good a shot as the first movie. In other words, if you have to see one of these movies, look at the first - although this movie is also powerful and enjoyable. As for me, I loved the story so much, I saw both movies and I enjoyed both of them. High Eyebrows "shows that it is put on a low rating. The owner demands slime - lots of muck to be more listeners. One way to discuss them is to make a multi-part dramatization of the famous killing two decades ago - though however, they decide to play up the story as if she were guilty and they even go so far as to send a writer to the lady's house pretending to be a minister (!), as well as broadcasting her present Needless to say, it destroys a woman and leads to a terrible tragedy, and then, then, Bogart feels some real remorse about such a garbage - which leads to a final dandy about journalistic integrity and decency. br /> <br /> Well-functioning, great story idea and message that is just as important today as in the 30's, that's one story h, a must see. In particular, notice the beautiful and very emotional confrontation scene when the daughter of the owner and attacking Bogart --- heck is a great example of acting and writing.
