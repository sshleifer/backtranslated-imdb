The summary is only for those who hate this film because finding an OK or average movie is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb made me nostalgic because I can't help in 1994. I was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters. He immediately became one of my favorite comedies and it took several years to become my favorite comedy. How can I tell what makes this movie my favorite? It was an excellent writing (the story was fine, but the script and dialogues were wonderful) Was it a superlative performance? Was it the mood of the movie? After thinking about it for so many years, I say it must be a mixture. It is one of those films that have no mistakes or its music (another movie that is currently appearing in my mind is Sholay) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your dramatic and comedy movies. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
