I finally found the version of Persuasion I love! Anne in this version does not look like a cleaning service, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman as if she was described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not seem to be 50 years old, nor does he look angry at all, but rather, as described in the book, he did not grow old like Anne and is pretty handsome. And they play their parts with such conviction and realism ... that's what it is about. They were believable. They created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. If you haven't seen this version, I encourage you to find it, order it, or request it either in the bookstore or in the library if you have to. It is worth the price and it is worth to wait. I looked at the 1995 version and the 2007 version, which rises above the other two. Why is it not rated higher is beyond my understanding. The book expresses the tenderness of their relationship and this film makes the book come alive.
