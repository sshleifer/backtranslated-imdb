No film could do justice to Faulkner's English language command. but here they did a pretty good job. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly what I had in the book, just like Chick. What the movie really couldn't do was how Beauchamp didn't like the blacks because he was just as stubborn. Not that it was a bad thing, but from my point of view of a book that was his attitude towards the world (yet I felt that it started with the racism of the white society, which started to push it into black society when it became his attitude) towards all). The best part of the movie is that you can look at Yoknapatawpha District (actually Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner lived and wrote). It doesn't look very different today. Because of this alone, the film is worth a watch considering it is filmed in Faulkner's backyard. The true must see the fans of Faulkner.
