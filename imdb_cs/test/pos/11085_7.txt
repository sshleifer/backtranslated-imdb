My father had previously worked with secret information in DIA and he was the one who mentioned me. If I were a boy, I would always ask him what would happen if he gave away the secret and recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> It really gives 2 in the movie, almost completely different FRIENDS! in the mesh they never knew what the result would be. Snowman, Daulton really cracked me because the film portrayed him as a mere drug pusher who didn't know what he was arguing about, and in the movie it seemed to be the worst. Falcon, Chris is just a person who wanted to express his feelings for the U.S government in a very radical view. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers it is necessary to see it !!!
