I rarely watch short films because they seem to be late night television and are not sufficiently promoted to know which short films are worth it. Since The Room is an extra feature on DVD Hitcher, it was amazing that I witnessed high quality with Rutger Hauer in excellent form. <br /> <br /> Artistically shot in black and white. The obsession of a man room that he passed in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in the style of a document / interview. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but is also built alongside ramblings and occasional flaws in fluency. This gives Hauer's performance a great deal of realism and depth, perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and increases the moving atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. Hauer proves he's more than just a psychotic Hollywood evil guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in flashback scenes as young Harry with a silent role. It shows how influenced by music and its disappointment when it disappears. The end is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature films. Very good effort.
