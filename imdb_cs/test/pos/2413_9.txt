For once the sequel to "Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did a great job at the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi, has completely differentiated himself from Julie with Julie. Both Daniel and Julie liked karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most interesting person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament in which to compete. And there will also be some humor in this movie. I liked the part where, when Julie returned from school, Miyagi looked at her and saw her clothes change. That was very funny! And the classic scene "Wax on, Wax off" was also different. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julia: "Uh-oh, last point". The set in Boston was far from California. The Militant group in this group was like "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Michael Ironside Col. Dugan wasn't John Kreese. His group practically left him when Julie kicked some serious ass. Everyone paid the price when they fired the classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they will find a redemption from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three that spoke of "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is extremely hot in every movie and everyone else he does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
