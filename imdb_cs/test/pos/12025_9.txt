This special Bravo is one of the most purely fun things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the world-famous Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band), Dan Band must be seen to be honored. On paper, Dan Band is just one joke act-guy sings girly songs and inserts gratuitous profanity into lyrics. If you listen to their "Dan Band Live" CD, that's all you get and it'll be old fast. (I bought it just because he had some songs that weren't in the TV special.) But what makes Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero, it's his amazing theatrical presence. This guy SWNS his audience every second he is on stage. And backup singers are also a big part of the visual punchline. As far as the real band is concerned, they remain largely out of sight, but they are certainly much more energetic and excited than your typical backing band. Hopefully a DVD release will be released shortly - it was almost certain that some songs were cut out, and although heavy censorship adds a bit of unintentional humor, it also removes the intense humor. <br /> <br /> If there is any point in Vegas casino owners, they will soon be struggling to see who can build Dan his own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member my name ... FAME!"
