I like this version of DORIAN GRAY and MGM version. Both add a little girl at the beginning of a story that grows up to have a relationship with Dorian (that's not in the original book), and that's my only complaint. Especially I like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version is much better (I think) and more reckless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: Briant is more true to the novel's Dorian. Finally, it is a very good adaptation of the novel (even suggesting how Dorian is in contact with men, as well as Wylde, who could not be done in the MGM version).
