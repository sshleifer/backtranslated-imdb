While this is certainly a nice way to spend a few hours and is always worth watching, this film never fully meets the goals it should have for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes or so heavily focused on Helen and Johnny, who are much less intriguing than most - Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more appealing. Although it works at first, because we don't always know everything about everything else in life, and because Helen is believed to be a little self-confident, he wears fast and we want to see more characters. . Second, it seems that the film in the second half has lost its way in terms of conspiracy. The letter itself is much less important than in the first half, and again, although in some ways it works well, it seems strange to leave as much of the potential shown in the first half. Overall, this movie is sweet and good-natured, with some really cheerful moments - for example, Janet explains the roots of a passionate audience. The lazy but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is difficult and the meaning of life in a small seaside town is accurately depicted, but the film is not as intelligent as it is trying to be. It's just missing that is a light romantic comedy and being a clever portrait of life. But it is still good and if you get a chance, it is definitely worth seeing.
