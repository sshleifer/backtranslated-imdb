This was the most provocative death penalty movie! She refused to seem one-sided, and the emotions she felt throughout the story were as real as she could get it. This film had one of the most 'human' (And I use this term in a good way) the compassionate religious character of all time! This movie actually caused me to go find and read the book (which is rare to me). Sister Helen has developed more spiritual tone than religion (which is also rare). And this was a question to both sides that the people on both sides who watched the film would not feel that a point was left out. And for that we have a director. It's not a movie for fun. But it is a film that brings a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can't think of another movie like this.
