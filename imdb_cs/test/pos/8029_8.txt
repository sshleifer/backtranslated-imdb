As soon as I knew Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this movie, he immediately told me it would be a good picture to display. Most Sutherland images are full of action and tension and can play a more cruel character and can also be charming and kind. In this picture, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good guy and a bad guy when he trained the maritime office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become another person overnight. There are lots of chase scenes and lots of situations where I don't want to play. This naval officer lived in a relatively community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize it until the film reveals its gruesome secrets in the background that it had to keep from family and friends. Good spy movie and great acting.
