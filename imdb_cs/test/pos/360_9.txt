I watched this thriller again, the one I previously believed to be one of Hitch's lesser efforts. How bad you can be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie is getting better with every tracking, but now I think it's amazing. Every bit of tension is torn from the smallest detail, and the last scene on the merry-go-round is just breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
