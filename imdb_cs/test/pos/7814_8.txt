I caught it on TV for the first time a few days ago. I expected to tune in for a few minutes, but the film caught my eye. Finally, I watched it all and found it surprisingly convincing. The behavior of the three American leaders was quite good, especially Alex. He plays a shooter with a relatively small degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are displayed in Westerns. He ended up in several situations when he was at the mercy of the hunters. The final firefight between the three lines and the bad guys was very good, just like the scene where the doctor dug a bullet from Clay McCord. Somewhat horrible, but realistic. I have to admit, despite my initial doubts about watching "spaghetti westerns", I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who likes western.
