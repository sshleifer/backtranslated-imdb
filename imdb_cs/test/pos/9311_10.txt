It was a very fun, fast-moving movie. I watched it more than once, and I leave my rental to show others. I would like to take this opportunity to ask someone who knows how HK manufacturers choose their subtitle translators? I'm curious. Drive me. Again, to return to review is a really flickering movie with lots of content, subtlety reminiscent of classics, even if it's full of slapstick. Reminiscent of, say, the Mexican comedy Cantinflas. The film does not disappoint the director's fans, who have noticed that he chose distinctly Chinese themes and tries to get to the characteristics rarely explored. The entire director's collection is a way to look into culture in a disarming way. And I don't see how his funny girl in the Chinese holiday could be covered.
