This is an outstanding Anderson production compared to the best UFO or SPACE 1999 episodes (first series). Of course it is not some SFX extravaganza or Star Wars pseudo-mystic tripe fest, but a subtle film that has a slow pace, yet it shows a spooky, terrifying and mysterious atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: for fans of 'cerebral' science fiction. Lynn Loring's voice is absolutely amazing. SFX are good for this kind of product and acting is also good. Two astronauts visit the planet on the opposite side of the sun, but instead they come home ... or do they? Oh, videophones! Every now and then he ran like another "gadget of each of the next decades," but still 40 years later. The planet Earth's twin device on the other side of the sun also returns to Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied who?
