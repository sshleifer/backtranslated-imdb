"Porgy and Bess" is an excellent work of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is tastefully designed in muted colors. The voices are excellent. Although Sidney Portier's voice is dubbed for his singing part, he gives a very moving performance. There is a notable performance of Sammy Davis Jr. like Sportin's life. So far there is no DVD that would be suitable for viewing, and this piece asks for one. All the smart moviegoers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on a new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that competes with all the other musicals, including the most distinctive of Rodgers and Hammerstein. Don't forget to ask your video supplier for this. Like Walt Disney's "Songs of the South", this may be a premise for racial overtones that hinder the marketing of this movie.
