It's such a pity that an important movie like this is virtually unknown. I don't think Alan Bates made a better film than this. . The only time I remember being on British television was in the summer of 1998. I have it on tape, but unfortunately the quality isn't great because of the lengthy antenna ... <br /> <br /> I remember I wanted this see the movie for some time before appearing on television. It was shown on Channel 4 in the early morning, ensuring that it still remained invisible, with the exception of a very small audience. At that time I lived in Bristol and it was ironic that when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I was walking around a BIG house where it was filmed several times !! The film treads a fine line; A married couple trying to clarify their tragic difficulty in coping with their heavily mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes. The direction and acting are so great that the film is always compassionate and moving and never in danger of getting into bad taste. A few years ago I saw a clip of a theater production with Eddie Izzard as Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila. It turned out that Izzard improvised and shocked and Hamilton joked to ignore the audience when it was like this. he saw only a short clip, but when he read the game and saw the movie, it is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable. what I saw. This is perhaps a surprisingly successful game failed to find the audience when it was finally filmed. This is one of Britain's finest 70's movies and hopefully will be released on DVD once.
