I noticed people asked if anyone had this show. I have all 26 episodes that have been broadcast in the US and will be willing to share them with anyone who is interested. All I need is to deliver VHS tapes or Blank DVD's on both formats and pay for shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request and I will notify you and we can take action. The quality is very good and they are very nice to watch, especially if you were not able to see it because they aired in the 60s. It was one of my favorite concerts as a child and I had a very special place in my heart because it will bring lots of memories of my childhood and other shows like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
