"The Devil in the Dark" is a popular episode of William Shatner. It's also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it addresses one of the main themes of the series: respect for other forms of life. I don't think we could get a clearer example of one of the most exciting shows of this show. In this episode, Kirk and his crew must face a monster that kills miners on a distant planet. The story is an excuse to explore the law that people must destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today's concerns about environmental causes make this show more significant than ever. It's very well written and done with gusto our beloved cast. One unforgettable sequence includes Spock joining the mind of a monster. Lots of tension between Spock and Kirk (wanting to solve the problem using different methods) contributes to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are doing the best work here.
