The latest film by the underestimated director Albert De Martin ("The Antichrist", "The Killer is on the Phone") is a truly exciting but incomprehensibly neglected giallo that contains almost all trademarks that make this Italian horror genre so amazing and addictive. fans. There are some very worrying topics (child abuse, fake priests ??), lots of scary moments, conspiracy twists left & right, excellent music and ??? last but not least ?? a handful of really sadistic murders! Especially the opening sequence, which is a prologue, is a powerful horror! What is it about ordinary baby dolls that make them so scary? When an anonymous man, dressed as a priest, attacked a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down the staircase, he sent me a cold trembling over my spine! A few years later, a young prologue girl is a wheelchair bound adult woman. She inherited a lot of money, but she used her wealth to encourage disabled people to practice sport and maintain a positive mindset. She? Joanna? he falls in love with his personal trainer and marries immediately. Naturally, it's just after her money and she starts to terrorize Joanna by reviving her childhood trauma that paralyzed her. Repeated paintings of a sinister-looking priest, led by terrifying melodies and children's rhyme, provide a "Murder Formula" with a ton of real fears, and the direction of Albert De Martin is very decisive. Acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in the famous greedy role of a villain. Due to some conspiracy holes and lack of originality, this film may not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many previously unknown and unknown Italian gialli received amazing DVD-releases and, hopefully, "Formula for Murder" gets the same treatment really soon. Meanwhile, good luck watching this baby down!
