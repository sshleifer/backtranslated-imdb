I'm really sad that this film has so much negative criticism. I think it's a nice comedy and really funny. The humor in this movie is a bit warm and innocent and I like it. I also like the Madonna character and disagree with playing herself. She created a character and likeable. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were a battle scene at the top of a sinking car and where Madonna climbs a fence in a fancy dress for her love. Humor in the movie has a somewhat syrrealistic touch and maybe it's not every cup of tea. But it's their problem, not the movie. This movie I found healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw it, for some reason, I was incredibly sad, and this movie lit up. And Madonna can act. Just take off the glasses of negative thinking.
