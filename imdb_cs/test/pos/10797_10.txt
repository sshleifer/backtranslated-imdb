In one of the less visible films from the late 1980s, at a time when Oliver Stone was high with Platoon and Wall Street (and before his opus, born on July 4), this scenario contributed to the script and directed this view. the world of radio, specifically one radio host in the middle of Texas. This man is Barry Champlain, in a career that Eric Bogosian once did in his career, who wrote the original game and also wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those scholars you hear on radio stations that many of us can turn off. He has in mind thoughts, opinions and is not just afraid to talk to them, but also to stand up against phone callers. The callers are indeed the driving force of the film, because Barry has to fight against mindless, obscene, racist and purely absent. As it goes on, he also has to wrestle with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and hit or miss the deal to go nationwide, outside the boundary of the southern route station's in. While following the movie I felt curious, as I saw how it would be on stage (I would imagine it was a show of one man as Bogosian had several on the side), the film's direction is phenomenal. Stone was known, almost typical, as a director who loves quick cuts, unlimited effects of assembly and effects with camera work styles and other small tricks that give his films a distinctive, almost authorial look in the 1990s. But in the 1980s he had this energy and feverish quality with respect to the film and was not as ugly as other films. To add the right intensity that is in Barry Champlain's studio and head-space, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seemingly claustrophobic at times, bold, confident and definitely on the edge. The scenes in the middle of the movie, when Barry is not in the studio, is quite standard, but the style, along with the stuff in the radio scenes, is one of the best I've seen in the Stone / Richardson combination. And we can't recalculate Bogosian's performance, which can be annoying, offensive, angry, passive, and everything we love and hate in radio shows. There is also a funny, close disturbing support role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who prank calls him one night, and another gets invited to the studio. These scenes are a bit uncomfortable for the viewer, but it's very interesting to Barry's 80's subcultural space. Stoner doesn't have to get it, but as he says "it's your show". It's really hard to cover everything that happens in the conversation, and there's a lot. But it's never boring, and like Champlain, it's not easy to ignore him. And when Bogosian enters his peak tirade in the air, with the panning background around in a continuous 360 spin, it becomes intoxicating, and the reason why freedom of speech is so strong. Stone was synonymous with the director of hot-button questions, which takes items that were or are still controversial, and gives them a life force that is not always great, but is all its own. Here, his abilities and ambitions do not get into the way of Bogosian - it is strengthened, if anything, which makes it an exceptionally qualified vision of what is essentially an almost one-man show that is already well written.
