Seeing Gary Busey in the G-rated movie was first and nice. I don't know much about the director, but of course he knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where does Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember Christopher Atkins was the Blue Lagoon. Disney must see this movie and put it to work. Woman thinks she is very cute. I liked what he was doing with his character. It seemed so real. Most of all we liked the message that this film broadcasts. Greedy sucks and faith, love and family wins! This is the first low-cost DVD we bought and had so many things on it. Producers did it for children and children loved it. They liked the music and all the accessories on the DVD. The director is unlikely to stick to family movies, but I hope he does - because he knows how to make the most of children, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey as a dog was even more fun. She didn't like this much. It's hard to find a family movie without all the humor, and Quigley was a pleasant surprise.
