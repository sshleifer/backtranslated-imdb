I liked this film, Columbo, his atmosphere, which was a real thriller and his approach even reminded me of film-noir, in the film his first 30 minutes. It's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with right camera angles and light usage. This does not immediately mean that this film is brilliant, though, but powerful enough to consider this good late Columbo movie entry. It is definitely a better film than the average "later" movie entry of Columbo. 26 years after his previous appearance at Columbo, George Hamilton is returning to lead the lead against Peter Falke, again as a killer Of course in a totally different and new role. I liked his role and he was a good Columbo 'villain' who gave a good old lieutenant some good competition. They had nice sequences together. The problem with "modern" new Columbo films has always been that it did not mean a well-known actor opposite Peter Falco. This film obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I have to say that this film is not Peter Falk in this best case. His character has certainly played better and his performance is not quite consistent in this film, which is probably also due to the film by his director Daryl Duke, who also directed the really horrible film "Tai-Pan" among many other projects. . It has a pretty good and enjoyable story, but the fact that the same kind of conspiracy to cover the murder was used earlier in Columbo's earlier movie doesn't help. It was used earlier in the 1975 film "Columbo: Playback". Of course, he still has enough of his own "original" moments with his story, although of course every Columbo movie is basically the same. But oh, that's what made the Columbo series so great and consistent. If it's not broken, don't fix it. It is also true that in this film more tracks than usual are omitted for the lieutenant, which does not mean that the film his killer is more stupid or sloppy, but I see how writers are more excited than others . This does not mean that the film or story is bad and in fact maybe even makes it more fun to see Columbo work hard and discover all kinds of small but important clues. Fortunately, the film is also filled with a pleasant and effective relief from Columbo-comedy. Just a good late entry into the Columbo movie. <br/> 7/10
