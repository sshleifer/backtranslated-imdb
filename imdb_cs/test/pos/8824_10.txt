I saw it very emotionally painful and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressure it was exposed to is illuminated so that even those who know something about it will be surprised. The cast was great, but Michael Sheen was excellent. I just realized it was him when I saw an earlier comment. He looks completely physically different in this role, from any other role I have seen in myself or as himself. Williams autobiography differs significantly from his diaries, as represented in this film. The movie is sometimes annoying to watch because of the emotional anxiety displayed. However, it is a useful experience and a movie that can be recommended.
