I liked playing in this movie. Except for a sister. She reminded me of Janice's Friends. I could never believe it was anything but unpleasant. My main problems with the film were the anti-climatic ending and the scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy got out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand was blown away and ran to something to help him, and she kissed him and rushed him to the hospital, maybe I could go to the end. I think someone needed to die of execution. Mainly brother-in-law. It was pain in the ass anyway. Or maybe the nurse needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. I could even buy a brother-in-law killing a hero and ending with two sisters who were put in snuff movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look again and, as I always say, it's much easier to be a reviewer than an author.
