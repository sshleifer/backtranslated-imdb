The description of Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. Certainly he will focus on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the largest theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money and mat√©riel that has ever occurred. Yes, it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. Visceral narratives and rough images make it more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. Instead, Stalingrad is a film about absolute and undeniable hell. The film is full of visual descriptions of the worst kind of war that is intensely personal and close to where one day a city block is spent. , just to be recaptured in a surprise attack. The early form of modern urban war, which the Germans called Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare), is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters are fighting in drainage tunnels, railways, and from building to building in a hell bomb that was destroyed by Stalingrad, only to be defeated by merciless Russian winter. The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the defamation of the Germans in this period, which many other films from Germany and the rest of the world are doing. Her characters are a group of soldiers who have waged war and tried to do it with themselves and with so many of their friends. The characters do not fight the Soviets from any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, not for any great dream about Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if the enemy kills them, and if the enemy does not, then their own officers will certainly refuse to fight. This image adds another layer to the choking envelope in the hopelessness trap that penetrates the film. What kind of ground companion Das Boot, Stalingrad has framed the epic struggle of World War II in personal light, and the unexpected perspective of an ordinary German soldier as a hero has become a tragic circumstance and a brutal government to sacrifice its victim.
