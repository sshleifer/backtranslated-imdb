I was skeptical before I got to it because of a terribly assembled trailer that made the same horrible movie. I was pretty surprised how much I didn't waste money. I believe that the success of the films comes from how scary it is and how the home environment is. Small things, such as sensor lights, create a real unpleasant feeling. The shadows and ominously cool feeling of the house make it easy to say that no matter how much you know horror movies, anything can happen in the movie. Acting is by no means perfect or bad. The main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her. In the end, I was totally overwhelmed by the film in most aspects. It is definitely a movie that I would recommend.
