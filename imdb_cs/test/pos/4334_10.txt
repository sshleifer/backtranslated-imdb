The movie is incredible, has a soundtrack that sets the tone of the movie. The lines in the movie are great, such as "Nothing Good for Friends" and "Time to Collect Charlie's Time." I can watch this movie over and over and still laugh because the lines and actions are of a kind. I feel that when I watch this movie, I want to go out and shoot down the bad guys if there's a movie you don't want to miss out on. "They killed the Giggler, they killed Giggler." The lines continue in the film. Deff. Go out and don't rent, but buy this movie worth the money trust me.
