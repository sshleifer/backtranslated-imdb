This film has an outstanding performance, Marilia PÃªra and stunning dicretcion from Argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was made with a child from "favelas", Brazilian ghettos. The children were not actors and were imprisoned by Babenco in Rio de Janeiro. The story is about criminal children who are arrested in prison prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. Children are constantly raped and defeated by a police officer. Unfortunately it is not purely fiction, it is still happening in Brazil today. Must see for those who like violent movies. But take your mother out of the room because it's a hard movie.
