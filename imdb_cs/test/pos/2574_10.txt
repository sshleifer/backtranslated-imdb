If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beatings and rape of a child, this film will satisfy you. If you want a person to talk creatively about the revenge of a woman's treasure, she has it. You've heard amazing music that keeps raw emotions. The surprise is that in the story of violence, action and music, a moment of silence can culminate, without the pedantic language that turns the film. Look at the last scene, which is an unexpected proof that the injured person is healing. Maybe we, who are wondering why we abhor the profane profane, will learn that love can be placed above the loins in the heart. From pumping pounding, follow the rhythm where love is sacred.
