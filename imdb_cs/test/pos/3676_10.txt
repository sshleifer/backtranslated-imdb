I also joined the IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but to sing its praise. I've never heard of this movie (it's so wrapped up, it's easy to see why it could go), but a good friend suggested it to me and I'm so glad she did. It's a gem of film. The actors are great (especially Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton) and they look really fun. Of course it was a bit over the top, but I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard or so often in two hours. If you like laughter then you owe it to you to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
