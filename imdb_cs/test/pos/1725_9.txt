I am the next generation of a man ... I have never seen that he was an original doctor, but I have heard of a series that in the past has provoked a great fan base and still made its mark in the 21st century; a new "Doctor" that started in 2005, but for those who live here in states like me, we almost see it as new episodes on the science fiction channel or BBC America; From the first season we introduced the new player Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and quite a new doctor, played by Christopher Eccelson (sorry for the distorted surname). these two go on a lot of amazing and extremely dangerous missions to save the world ... now and then they have companions from former mickey rose friend to the now-present Jack Harkness (who can be seen on Torchwood's spin off). From season one to season, the pace is almost right ... the stories can be from a pointlessly strange to the most active pace, but no matter how hard it is on roller skates from the beginning of the theme song, which is very catchy. br /> <br /> in Season 2 becomes different and change, and now a new doctor (David Tennant) continues to fight for the world to save the rose, and from that moment there may be some who say some season was not as good but I have to disagree with it and it was sad to see how the rose and the doctor split, but leaves the role of the "introductory" companion to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman), who continues to fight to save mankind ... the third season is now rather on action / adventure level and sometimes emotional but not up to the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha fits, but the attraction can be rushed to occasionally and the appearance comes into play that is NOT from Tyler's being that you have experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it may have been a bit uncomfortable For me the cause that you get to use to ascend and her ways, and now see someone who sometimes doesn't really ask a doctor at the emotional level, but still makes the pace very exciting for the audience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. All in all it's one exciting ride on a TV show I would have given more, but there are some flaws in this show also that I can't mention to cause its sometimes hard to pick up, but only one is doing which is a doctor and Martha the relationship is rushed and not aligned to know you base; I saw a good show on British television, but it is by far one of the best sci-fi adventures for old and new generation to experience, but you don't have to take my world for it ... to enter the tardis and join the adventure.
