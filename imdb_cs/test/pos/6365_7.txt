Many people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This film proves otherwise. Aykroyd is brilliant in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that it wastes too much time near the end of jumping back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who watches him to prove he's a scam. The doctor goes nuts like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What Bob?". The scenes where the doctor desperately tries to get back to Los Angeles are stupid, unbelievable and rude. Otherwise, this aspect of the movie is really funny, especially the first half.
