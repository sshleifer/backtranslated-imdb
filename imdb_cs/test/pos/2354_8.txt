I remember seeing this movie when I was very young and on TV several times. I always liked it. I noticed how the local TV shows that one scene has a reversed film. It is a place where they hide behind a rocky outcrop (it looks like rocks of Vasquez near Los Angeles) and watch the Indians ride. If you look carefully, you will notice that all of the soldiers are left! It's just a short segment and I have to admit it took me years to notice it. As far as history is concerned, expeditions were often held to rescue the white prisoners of the Indians. The direct connection to the last battle scene is the Battle of Beecher Island. In this action, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines (Spencer Carbines Not Winchesters) were surprised by Indians and withdrew to the island and suspended several fees. In the last round, they killed Roman Nose, one of the more famous Indian chieftains. I have no idea if he wrote the script for the script, but it fits well. There are several Guy Madison movies that will come out on DVD once and that's one of them.
