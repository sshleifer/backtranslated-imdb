When commenting on this film, one has to realize that it is based on a true story and therefore has to be reviewed in terms of the quality and accuracy of its display of events as well as its fun values. It may be unlikely that Jack Shepherd should give up twice Wild Wild because Wild has captured Edgeworth Bess. Yet it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on proven techniques. There were cases when Clavell had no confidence in watching the script as written. The film would be better if it had. And yes, I had a copy of the script (a copy of Stanley Baker - one in five) that I recently returned to my father, writer Rafe Newhouse.
