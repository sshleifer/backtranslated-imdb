Wow! My mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap at some store in my city, and she knows I like scary movies. At first I looked at the cover and sighed when I thought it was some ordinary B-movie trying to be scary. I was so bad! I made a big big mistake when I watched it myself, my parents and brother slept and it was really late. After I saw the movie, I was so scared that I was shaking ... I didn't even dare go up and take the videotape from the VCR! I slept with lights ... <br /> <br /> This main movie story is about some teenagers riding on the road and having to spend the night in the woods, telling terrifying stories ... The first story is really scary and it does You hug a cushion really hard if you look at it yourself. The second story is also scary, but not the same way as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really scary. Most of the stories frightened me. It's the guy who drives on the ground on a motorcycle. One night, when there is a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door. The girl opens and she is muted. I could add that when I saw it, my heartbeats were really abnormal. The main story of the "Camp Story" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it was licked, but I, my friend and my friends, loved it and it was a long time since we got so scared .. rating: 10/10, oh by the way, it's not like Urban Legend it's so scarier for everything.
