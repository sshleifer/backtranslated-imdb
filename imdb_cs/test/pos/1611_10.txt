Are coastal resorts sad, gloomy places that are always portrayed as in movies and novels? Certainly this film, along with near-contemporary "Don't Look Now" depicts Venice as a particularly dirty and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-friendly approach, see "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). As soon as I was in Venice, I cannot say for sure, but it makes it the perfect setting for this dark but luxurious show by Luchin Visconti, one of the world's greatest stylists. When I saw the film I wish now, I got into reading Thomas Mann's novel, which is based on (which also inspired Sir Benjamin Britten's opera). Since I do not know the back story and the film has little in the way of conspiracy or exposure, I left thinking about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) obsession with young Tadzio. Is it gay? Pedofil? Or is his desire for beautiful youth something innocent? Tadzio might remind him of what he could be and now he knows he will never be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung fu: in 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long, and it moves in a leisurely but barely slow pace. The film benefits from the grandiose music of Gustave Mahler, on which the character of Aschenbach is clearly founded. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance and the film is decorated with the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of Italy's greatest beauties, as Tadzia's mother.
