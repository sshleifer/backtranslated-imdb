I am very impressed by the reviews I read about this film - generally well read, thoughtful and informed - apparently by people who like movies and think about them. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent work that IMDb members have already done. If I could, I would like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many reviews: Mr. Baseball was an American and he was ugly, but he was not an ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous novel of 1958 by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr. Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and an archetypal engineer - he traveled to Vietnam to work with people, respect and enjoy the people he met, use appropriate, sustainable technology in collaboration with his hosts, and enjoy and respect them. because it demonstrates democratic values ​​and American virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, only deep; his personality and his humanity were deep and true. Mr. Baseball illustrates all the hopeless, uncertain hobbies that we Europeans and Americans often expose to other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. I believe ugly Americans still outweigh Mr. Baseball; they are still our last, best hope.
