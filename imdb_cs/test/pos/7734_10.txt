I can't believe low scores for this movie. The probable reason is to do with a low number of votes, which is few people. This is just a fantastic movie! There are a lot of stories that intertwine inside, but it's not complicated. Each character grows with film and we experience life changes with them. The scenery is just amazing and the final credits are the best in every movie I've seen (just like Shakespeare's play). Yes, it is a bit dated (filmed in 1982), but the problems faced by the characters are very topical. It could have been filmed in 2002 without editing the storyline. Raul Julia is amazing, the best role in the film - it's his signature. Young Molly Ringwald is excellent when she matures on a girl. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman, and John Cassavetes is a force that puts it all together. Do yourself a favor, find this movie, watch it and enjoy it. Return to IMDb and upload this movie to the top 250 of all time it really belongs.
