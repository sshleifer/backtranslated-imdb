Van Damme has made some great movies over the years, and he hit a big ten in my books. From setting Mexico to the five stellar battle scenes, this film was amazing. The film is about border guards protecting the territory that is the border of Mexico. Ex Navy seals are smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances like a cop and villain. Although this film was not as good as it was until death, it still gave the action, gaming and film a five-person look. I am always looking forward to these b grade action movies and getting better. Watch this movie if you enjoyed movies like - To death, The hard corps, and the other in command.
