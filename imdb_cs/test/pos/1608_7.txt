In Luchin Visconti's Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty of the surrounding world that is decaying, but in the pursuit of the very beauty of Gustav von Aschenbach, it falls apart into the mantle of man. To understand the decline, we must recognize the beauty that enchants us, is best described and explained in the quotation of Socrata found in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice, "beauty itself is beautiful and visible at once? The only spiritual aspect we can perceive through our senses? Otherwise, if divine, if reason and virtue and truth are to speak to us through the senses? We see what happened in the film, a man craving a beauty that turns into a desire for a boy, Tadzio. Even though part of his mind tells him that worship of beauty can lead to sensuality and abandonment, he cannot keep himself. It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful movie; In the beginning we see the extravagance of the salon and we treated it as a perfect summary of life on a higher class, perfectly captured by cameraman Pasqualino De Santis. However, Visconti does not touch the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are put to the past. The city we know to have unique beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a recreation center with boring hotel staff. Streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting dirt and rot, the city falling apart with the protagonist. Just through flashes of memories, we could see why this famous composer is fragile and harmless. The death of his daughter, and probably his wife, along with the failure of his music, allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. Alfred, with whom Aschenbach talks deeply about the importance of beauty and who can create it; But Alfred is more than a friend, it is Aschenbach's alter-ego, and what Alfred is saying expresses the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip by Alfred, who tells him that he is weak, estranged and lacks feelings. Finally, we could conclude that these flashbacks are not a reality at all. It's a memory decline, rather than an objective representation of the past, these flashbacks becoming distorted memories. We can say that these are memories that have been spoiled because Aschenbach points out, declares, "reality disturbs and degrades us"; and after the scene in the travel agency's office, we see Aschenbach face Tadziom and his family and warn them - to leave Venice, but right after the meeting we see him sit back with the clerk and realize that it's all in his imagination, he's been busy for a long time without dialogue that is framed by the engaging music of Gustav Mahler. It allows the viewer to wander as we watch Aschenbach's life and respectable decline with the beauty around him. The viewer slowly realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by the exhaustion that is mixed with the growing awareness that the city is choking in dirt. The crumbling city is paving the way for a middle-aged man to be attracted to Tadzio, a romantic desire for something so idealized and ambiguous that he can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy in him will kindle the fire that lit him at first, then consumes him. The film concludes that von Aschenbach sat faintly in the beach chair and watched Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down his face and it looks like rotten blood. before his last breath. There was the last decline, the city was polluted all around him, and he became what he hated. Aschenbach dies that he has the same painted face at the beginning of the film as the old man on the ferry, the man who disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decline, in pursuit of artistic beauty he could not feel his own extinction and the extinction of the city around him; His sensuality is devoted while constantly being kept under the control of the presence of death and decline. These are the three motifs that combine buried and death in Venice together, beauty, death and decline, these themes of Visconti's art, the beauty of his work being in the disintegration of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this film, we are processed to deliquescence one big man. We see the revered composer Gustav von Aschenbach in pursuit of true and pure beauty, and this is in pursuit of this property that it extends all around him and leads him to an unhappy, lonely death pursuing the goal of his affection. I believe that through these films Visconti is trying to say that what is beautiful cannot last. Decay is the inner world around us, and when we are distracted, it can destroy splendor. In the film Death in Venice, it's because of culture and the pursuit of beauty that everything is erased. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together as thorns in Visconti's work, suddenly beautiful and destructive, that is these themes that define his art.
