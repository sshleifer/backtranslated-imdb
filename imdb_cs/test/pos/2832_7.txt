Overall, he wants it to be a better film, but it has enough flashes of intense strength to make it worth it. Peck made this film during the same period that he did the Gunfighter, before he apparently decided he was a memorial rather than an actor. Damage! He was a great actor, perfectly willing to solve characters that were not very sympathetic and to do them very well. The character he plays here is controlled and, if necessary, reckless. Given the mission assigned to the character and the "men" with whom they are to do it, these qualities are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this movie as an early, witty example of Dirty Dozen. The dialogue in this film is a bit of a ham, but it is atmospheric and intense, and it definitely tells a story worth telling. It includes the good work of all actors, and even Barbara Payton becomes credible. <br /> <br /> This is often not shown on TV, so a local video store can be the only place to find a copy. Go on! Give it to the evening. It's worth your time!
