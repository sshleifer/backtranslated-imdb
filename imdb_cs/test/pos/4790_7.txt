Nazarin is a recognized surrealistic Bunuel, apparently an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It's not a visual movie and I think it would be better on stage. Bunuel leads us through this man, the Nazarene, who lives like Christ; a true follower, ie in poverty, and without caring for property, and what he will bring next day. Some might call it a parallel to Christ's story, but every follower and practicing word, life should be like Christ. But basically, Bunuel also asks about the person's well-being and his need for sin and how good can save us. It's a bold statement that can revive or recite a movie for some. True, to say that Nazarene is also selfish because he gives, without asking in return, or asked for it. His selfishness is his folly, and the two women who follow him represent the sides of the coin, with the same face on each side. Lots of people present coin sides in this movie, all with the same faces. But the film is not exactly remembered as soon as it is over and one could attack many of his ethical perforations and effusions within the film's own doctrine. Not a top-notch Bunuel, but a "surrealistic" dream sequence that bunuel stages where the movie report is framed and worth mentioning is that it shows you the director's ability, Bunuel.
