In my personal opinion, I think it's the biggest video game ever created! The first time I played this game with my friends years ago, the next day I went out and got my own. Since I stopped playing seven years ago. I can't help it. I was addicted to other games on other, much newer systems, but I'm still coming back for more Goldeneyes. Each mission is amazingly fun and challenging, multiplayer mode was just like anyone else. I hope you can be as happy as I had to play four player multi-player mode because I had brothers and friends who would be together and play this game all the time.
