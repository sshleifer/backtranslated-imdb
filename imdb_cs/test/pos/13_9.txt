I work at a cinema and every Thursday night we have one movie screened the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I've seen trailers and advertisements, and I never expected much from her, and I never saw this movie before. It turned out that this movie was much more than I thought. Above all, it was a great story. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner have done amazing acting in this movie. Being a big fan of The 70's Show, I have always considered Kutcher to be no other than Kelso, despite the great acting at The Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this movie, I think I could look at him. Finally look like a serious player. actor. It was also a great tribute to the US Coast Guard's unmatched heroes.
