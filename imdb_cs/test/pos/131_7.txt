A fairly interesting look at some of the characters from the emerging middle class of India. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture does not hold. This film includes a patriarchal society where women are not really free citizens yet. The lands of marriages, men who dally with lovers with utter impunity, and women who are expected to endure it all eventually come short. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was quite attractive and played her character with utmost seriousness. But I was even more impressed by Shaban Azmi, whom I know is a Bollywood fix for many years. Her calm beauty and low mental suffering were excellent. The lesbian context of this film has never been particularly erotic and never titillating. (Darn!) It's worth looking at those who are interested in completely different cultures.
