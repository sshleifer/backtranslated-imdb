Okay, let's get out of the way first: Lifeforce is a waste of cinema. As a fun amusement for SF enthusiasts, she has a lot of merit. If you like watching old SFB black and white movies - giant mutated spiders / ants or strange monsters wandering in the desert - you really get a kick from Lifeforce. Bad Things: The story doesn't make sense and acting is pretty poor. Good things: Special effects are halfway; it has a pleasantly different British center story (that is set in London) which gives a different feeling to most SF films; and it has well-endowed Mathilda May (amused billed as "universe girl") wandering hot nude. <br /> <br /> In short: it's fun. I've seen it half a dozen times, and every time he comes on TV, I'll take the time to notice it - it's partly with the naked Mrs. May - but it's also to do with looking forward a little undemanding and silly SF.
