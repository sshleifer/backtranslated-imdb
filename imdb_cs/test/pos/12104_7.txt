Akin's 2004 winning film Head-On / Gegen die Wand from 2004 portrayed the attractively chaotic world of a self-destructing but dynamic Turkish-German rocker named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is an offshoot of Head-On and explores the range of music that we can find today in Istanbul if it were as energetic and curious as the German avant-rock musician Alexander Hacke of the Einstuerzende Neubauten (who arranged a soundtrack and performed some music for Head-On) ) and had the help of a film crew and Turkish speakers provided by director Akin. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop between them. It is such a chaotic and open world as Cahit, where the East is in the East and the West in the West, but twain? Somehow? They meet. Just like Istanbul itself, sitting on the edge between Europe and Asia, connecting the two worlds together while remaining sui generis, that is the rate that includes Turkish pop, Turkish traditional songs, Kurdish laments, Roma jazz Musicians and a group of street buskers (Siyasiyabend), live and unconventional footage of street life in Istanbul, and some talk about camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history singers and musicians. Working from the Grand Hotel de Londres in Beyoglu, Istanbul, where Cahit remained at the end of Head-On in search of his beloved, Hacke roams the city with crew and equipment, interviewing people and recording their music. Begins with some loud rock "neo-psychedelic" Baba Zula ?? they are the musicians he has teamed up with, while putting together a Head-On score and standing here for absent bassist - and Turkish (including brave women) rappers? which causes some old people to leave the theater early and leave out the mostly melodic and easy-to-listen sounds that make up the bulk of the film. (Head-On's narrative fluctuations were periodically alleviated by the musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra that sat outside on the other side of the Bosphorus.) Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and hear the performances of some of the most famous living Turkish singers, including Mueyyen Senar the 1980s, whose aging, elegant musicians remind one of the ways in which the Egyptian songwriter Umm Kulsoum played. Hacke gets songwriter-film star Orhan Gencebay to do a striking solo on the long-necked oud he wrote all his songs on, and convinces the now elusive big Sezen Aksu.to make a special performance of one of her most famous songs, "Memory of Istanbul." so is the lament of a beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar recorded in a bathtub whose acoustics are spectacular if they could just warm up the heat? singer and musician face the stream of sweat. There is also a young Canadian woman, Brenna MacCrimmon, fluent in Turkish, who sings Turkish traditional apes with expression and fervor. The sound mix is ​​of high quality. One would like to see the sequel; many great examples of Turkish popular and classical music were necessarily omitted. The film released summer 2005 and appeared at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York on June 9, 2006.
