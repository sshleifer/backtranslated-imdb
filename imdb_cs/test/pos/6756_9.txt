The words themselves cannot describe the sheer beauty and strength of this film. Do you think this is the Toy Toy story. Now, I think "Toy Story", circa 1934. Now imagine that animation looks alive, like fluid. Think of a movie not as something that adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a movie. Imagine doing something like that in 1934. In the story of toys coming to life and one of them trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner, Starewicz adds an unexpected level of animation. It's so fluid that you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really a stop-motion animation. The Comparison of "Toy Story" and "The Mascot" is a futility exercise, a conspiracy: while "Toy Story" is a children's story that adults can enjoy, to adults. That means you won't like it. One bit. <br /> <br /> Still, if you can. You may be able to find it along the "Vampyr" in DVD and LaserDisc. And get ready to be amazed at what Starewicz was able to do with several puppets in 1934.
