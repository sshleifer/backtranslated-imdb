Brilliant and sensitive film with intertwined lines. As a general warning, the film changes in the middle of the way. As suddenly, it's a change I found suitable for movie themes, especially for comparing Ishkanani with a dirty rich and (as Finn says at the end) how each person forms a tribe and how a whole tribe is reflected in each person. Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this film. He is probably best known as Chekov by Star Trek or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he has been in a number of films that you probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, another great performance on Yelcin's work, House of D, Heart in Atlantis) to name a few ...) The thing is, this guy really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other outstanding performances from Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what takes this film to a notch, from great to excellent.
