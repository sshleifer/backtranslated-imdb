James Cagney (Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) has just begun his career and was able to act as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys' school that is run by corrupt politicians. Reform school prisoners are underage minors from the streets of New York, such as "East Side Kids" who were poor and impartial at a time of great economic crisis. In the final stages, judicial reform boys are held with blazing torches and a barn that is set on fire and a great leap of corrupt guards. I noticed that they had finally left the barn. This movie is not often shown and I really understand WHY!
