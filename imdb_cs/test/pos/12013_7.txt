Real surprise. It's not just family fun from "Disney". Some violence, lots of tense moments and a great story based on reality. The theme "Night transition" is, determination wins. Two East German families risk not losing sight of their goal in their bold balloon that escapes freedom. The story is terrifying and gratifying. Time is not on their side. The East German police are closing and the result is far from certain, to the very end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment that contains no nudity and limited violence, then I highly recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure fun. - MERK
