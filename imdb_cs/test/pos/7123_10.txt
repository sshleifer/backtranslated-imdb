I saw the original rough display that he had seen four times on Gencon four years ago. I was pleased that I did, my daughter is in the movie. I stood in the back of the room watching the younger fans sit on the edge of the seats, dead calm and no skip line. Standing ovations then were like watching fans when the US hockey team beat the Russians at the Montreal Olympics. <br /> <br /> I like great comedy and gag sight. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows. The Lesser shows that I won't even watch. <br /> <br /> This movie will do what Animal House did for players for College Frat days, what Dodge Ball did for strange sports. Forget the lack of mega budget to support production. This is pure art, it's so good. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be happier for the entire manufacturing and manufacturing company.
