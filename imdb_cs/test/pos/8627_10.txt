Abbott and Costello live in this version of the classic story. In "Jack and Beanstalk" is all you can see, music, magic and comedy that are in one. Costello plays Jack after listening to a story one boy once said. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sells his "Dolly" cow for 5 magic beans. Well, he did the five beans, and they were really magic. He climbs into the sky, sees a large castle there, and sings an unknown song he meets with a giant (Buddy Baer). Not only he, he danced with a woman who was also a giant. She would wear Jack's elbows during the dance. That was funny! You have a harp game that knows how to lay a giant. A goose that puts golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He gets an ax and starts chopping on a beanstalk. Another fun is where the ax gets stuck during the chop and the last celebration happens when people dance around the imprint where the giant has fallen. Very recommended! 5 Stars!
