I can honestly say that this movie is the most amazing movie ever !!! If you're in the mood for comedy, I recommend this movie! Here's a summary. There's a girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and goes on vacation with her father (Andre), whom she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the vacation to be totally boring when she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than her. So, to impress him, he says he's not on vacation with his father, but her lover. This is a hysterical film from start to finish and I highly recommend it. So rent and enjoy !!!
