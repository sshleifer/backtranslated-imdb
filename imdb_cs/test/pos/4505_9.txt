KITE RUNNER is one of the modern epics we sometimes encounter. This film extends on two continents, in several generations of families and in many decades, and touches on countless items such as friendship, love, loss and ultimately redemption. The main draw is the young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with rental assistance; mainly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), Hazara boy who is family probably lower than the ruling Afghans. But these two forms form a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), closeness in Amir's house, and of course flying a dragon. But bad times are on their way to Kabul city. The Communists are invading, and Amir and Hassan have separated because of the incredibly brutal act of prejudicing the Afghan boy against Hassan. They never see each other again. Amir's father races to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan and finally find their way to America. Here two set up a gas station and live a hand to mouth selling in specialized markets. And when Amir's father gradually becomes sick, a new revelation hits Amir's heart; one who cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. Studying friendship, war and reconciliation, Kite Runner is a really fantastic piece of cinema. The story is never inappropriately spoken in English whenever we are in a foreign country and we divide English every time we are in America. It was refreshing and lent a sense of realism. Acting was on par with the best you see. Particular attention must be paid to Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Babu, Amir's sick father and powerful patriarch. Also lead Khalid Abdalla as an older Amir plays well, especially when returning to Kabul to find him in ruins; quite a contrast from when he left. Afghanistan's cinema during Amir's escape and his ultimate return is nothing short of breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks causing your mouth to relax. you don't know exactly which mountain range they used in the movie, but wherever it was, I want to go there and shoot it myself! "But it's not even cinematography, or playing one or two people, which makes this film a success. It is a simple story that is very well narrated and is worth watching all the movies you watch. Highly recommended.
