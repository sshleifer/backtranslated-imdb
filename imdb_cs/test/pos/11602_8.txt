The Hindi version of the movie is 121 minutes. The film (based on the Tagore novel), which takes place in Bengal in the early 20th century, draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodin, becomes a widow within one year of her marriage, but does not accept the restrictions imposed on her by her widow. The film has a beautiful look at it, but maybe Aishwarya Rai is from her depth in portraying the strong character of Binodini with his subtle combination of idealism and piety. Binodini's idealism does not, and as a result, the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried.
