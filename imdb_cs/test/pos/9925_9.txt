I consider myself an occasional fan of Darius Argento. For every really good movie from him (such as "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), there seems to be one that is equally uninspired (his output from "Opera" tended to disappoint). However, there is still no denial that when it is the best, there are few horror directors who can put it on top. I consider "Opera" to be the best Argento work. This is definitely a movie where all of its trademarks are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot has very little meaning as soon as you begin to explore. Think of Argento as the European equivalent of Brian DePalma - that style is what matters. Typical for Argento, there are some beautifully filmed murder sequences. Those who are unfamiliar with male work can perceive it as a sadistic remark (and because they often encounter it), it is really true. Argento lists murder with intricate visual detail. She really does graphic violence in an artistic way. Moreover, his direction and the appearance of his films is impeccable. Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its scariest products. Argento is the only director I believe booming rock music works well for horror sequences (when others try to pull it out, it's like cheesy). Acting is different, Cristina Marsillach plays beautiful and reasonably sympathetic, but never extremely animated. The rest of the actors are hardworking and doing their job, but again, with Argento, acting is never a goal. Its beautiful colors, frightening violence and total fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)
