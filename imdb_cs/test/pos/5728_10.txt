I myself am a physics student and I must say that this is one of the best "popular" introductions to the string theory out there. The sleek Universe is able to access the entire theme of the string (though it is actually M) theory to a wider audience. Some "popular science" programs believe that the best approach is just to move the audience to a deep end, throw technical jargon at them, without just explaining it, and present the theory in a boring, outdated style. This program explores concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be solved between the two, so we have a comprehensive theory that can be applied to the universe, both large and small. I think some might say it's slow and takes too long to get to interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's against the point. It is almost impossible to explain the string theory from the beginning without at least mentioning the physics in its base, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is bright and fun. Whether you like this program really depends on whether you are willing to be initially justified by some of the ideas Greene introduces: the next dimension and the distortion of space-time are not widespread in everyday life, are they? But if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this program, you will find it allows you to look into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you are studying physics, well, it's great fun as well as you'll probably be able to watch and appreciate it even more!
