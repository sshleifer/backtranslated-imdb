Errol Flynn had enough gifts for a comedy that was unfortunately rarely exploited. Given the right material, this film demonstrates that he could have been happy at home in the style of Cary Grant, a subtle comedy. It's definitely the best of his various genre invasions. Patti Brady takes great care of the children's work and Eleanor Parker looks stunning all over the movie. Another bonus is the beautiful Hattie McDaniel, which is unfortunately underestimated in this film - yet a welcome presence. Flynn performs his comedy duties with the same simple style he has brought to his swashbuckling roles. The fact that it seems easy is not that it is. Super small family comedy, great for Christmas or any other time when you feel happy to have fun.
