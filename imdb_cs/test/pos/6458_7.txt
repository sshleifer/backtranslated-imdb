Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears at New York shipyards and is looking for a job but with a hidden past. He gets one under the condition that he pays the kick back to the raw boss Jack Warden. While there, he strikes a friendship with the black Sydney Poitier, which unfortunately leads to a gut-cruel moral dilemma for a man, which, we learn, typically runs from his problems. The movie looks like an Oscar winner On the waterfront, he feels like the waterfront, and most importantly, plays like in 1954 Kazan. But his racial theme is breakthrough over time. Black Poitier and White Cassavetes are considered equivalent in every respect. It could even be called the first of black and white "friends" that would later dominate so many action movies. However, the central error of the film is unable to show why the crew-chief Poitier is pushing friendship with dour Cassavetes in the first place. He really is out of the way to make friends with the newcomer. But why would he do that it would never have occurred to him. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with the other crew members of the Warden, but then he really acts like that guy. It is a hint that in some of Cassavetes' suspicious reactions, but in addition, the relationship seems unmotivated. Everything is happening in a dirty location in New York, without the usual movie accessories. In this sense, it's anti-Hollywood production, carefully deglamorized even down to a night scene that looks like a real crowd after an hour. I believe that sociologists would see this rather raw slice of life "poor workers". Kazan film for comfort. Here, the gentle unknown actress Kathleen Maguire gets the role of a friend's redeemer, guardian of the role of corrupt working boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, has to suffer a bloody beating before regaining moral status and doing the right thing. Yet, despite the derived nature, the harsh urban drama leaves enough original strength to deserve a look.
