Very pleasant 50 years. I have it in my collection and I recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Mostly Victor Mature's movie and, in my opinion, quite well done. He is a hunter who joins the scout border post. Red Cloud grabbed three of them on their land and took their property. They all joined as scouts after their loss. Victor looked at the Colonel's wife and lives on a post without any regulations. An action that is totally convincing but no great depth or many feelings for other characters. 50 years Westerns are my favorite and it is easy to move to satisfaction. The West of this kind is on the pages of the past and may never do it again. One who enjoys it. It gave 7 reviews. Probably 6.8 worthy, but movies like these are more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For movie noir fans ... "The Big Steal" "The Side By Side" are the most beautiful movies to be enjoyed. Bought and viewed. Noir seems to resemble a western way. Sometimes long ago and never forever.
