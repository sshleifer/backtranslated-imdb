I have seen this movie since I was a little girl, and to be from New York and remember how people lived back, brought back a lot of good memories. This film is not just about wanting a fairy tale, but understanding the struggles to become a better man, woman, and provider of Claudine. It was about the social system that committed women to a binding situation. It was the injustice of the system that attacked and placed demands on the family to stay above water. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role and it was well-deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but beautiful ties, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a viewer is to maintain an open mind and understand the overall frustration.
