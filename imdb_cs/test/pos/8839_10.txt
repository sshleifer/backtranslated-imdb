When John Carpenter's masterpiece "Thing" was released in the summer of 1982, it was dotted with critics and bombing at the box office. Viewers couldn't handle another "bad" alien, they wanted ET. Their loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I'd kill to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was ahead of us; now it has affected a new generation of filmmakers, showing it is a way on things like "Se7en", "Alien 3", and even "X Files", which unceremoniously ripped it aside by page. A structure that avoids the development of characters in favor of the incredible SFX is commonplace in today's commonplace blockbusters. The carpenter shows the same skills he chased in "Halloween", using a camera to create a disturbing and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are fine and the end is amazing - unique today. A Paranoid Masterpiece.
