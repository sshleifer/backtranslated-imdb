I feel like I saw this movie inadvertently. Actually, I ran through this movie by accident. One night I recorded another movie on Showtime, overnight and this movie appeared later. I sat down and watched as I threw him out. Acting is absolutely excellent. Kathy Bates ... who was my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes performed amazing performance as the dominant mother who desperately tries to stick to her old school values ​​(religion, family) at the risk of her family being stolen. Martin Sheen is great as a "hard" patriarch who has nothing to control in his life or family. One thing I really loved about this movie is how it happens when heroes return home. It shows the real damage that is caused to our soldiers after fighting against senseless wars for political and financial gain. This movie blew me away and I feel blessed to have filmed and seen this movie by mistake. This is a must-see for anyone who wants a real drama, it's not too melodramatic and preaching, but it pulls on your heart like no one else.
