Before the film, there were heist films, probably influenced by Rififi. thinking. Being cool is an equally important feature of a modern crime movie like weapons and gangsters, and Melville adds it to this film in droves; The film's tone is also very relaxed and Melville allows a large part of the film to come under the cool exterior. The story has many angles, but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the infamous murderer Vogel, who slipped from the nose of Commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does after the release is to steal some money from his former boss Ric, and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and sharpshooter to help him pull out the gem robbery. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The film is combined with four outstanding performances. Alain Delon is calm and counts as an anti-hero of the film, while Gian Maria Volontè looks impressive in his role as an escaped killer. François Périer is also good as a dubious club owner, while the real standout performance comes from André Bourvil as a police commissioner. The film runs for almost two and a half hours and it is not exactly as exciting a ride. However, the director keeps things interesting by focusing on important elements. The film presents criminal film shapes, such as shooting, but is kept to a minimum. The first two thirds of the film are really just building up to the thrilling scene of robbery to the end. Rififi was best known for his heist succession - a intricately designed scene in which no one speaks a word. Heist in this film is similar in that he is also without words, and I must say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in the direction and the calm and composed way he plays are doing well. The film is reduced to an exciting peak that envelopes everything. Overall, it might not reach all movie crime fans because the action is more than a little slow; but the Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
