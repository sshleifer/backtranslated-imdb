Being from the Buffalo area, I was well aware of the film, which read many articles in local publications. The film impressed me most, especially his clever plot, acting and local scenes. I like to see so many older, quality stars in different roles. I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the film superb and you can leave the theatrical feeling that your time was well spent.
