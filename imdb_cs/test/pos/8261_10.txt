Please let me know about all the versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth on a video that people may be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books with all my heart and would be very grateful if I had any information about VHS or DVD. I've read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorite Mary Webb, many times, and she has also collected other novels. I was lucky enough to find "Springs of Joy" poetry and essays, but I was never able to see the version of Precious Bane that was on the Masterpiece Theater, or the full version of Gone to Earth, even though there was the American movie The Classic Wild Heart Ventilation, that was a chopped-down version of Gone to Earth. <br /> <br /> If anyone can help me get copies of one or both of these movies (full version), I'd be grateful!
