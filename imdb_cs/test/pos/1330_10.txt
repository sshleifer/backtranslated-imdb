With such a cast I knew it would be amazing. Still, I was careful because I was always continuing. Would it keep the feeling of the first movie? Could they replicate the tensions and excitement of the 11th Ocean Master Robbery? We'll never know because they didn't. At least not as I expected. Instead, they made light and truly humorous parody of the heist genre. If you want to keep your logical robbery, don't look at it. If you want a good laugh, with a funny dialogue, unpredictable characters, and an absolutely brilliant scene where Julia Roberts has to pass herself, then you'll love 12 Ocean.
