Ida Lupino is imprisoned in her own house by crazy Robert Ryan in the 1952 film "Beware, My Lovely," by RKO. Lupino and Ryan were doing three films and working as a team, both being perfect professionals and powerful artists. In this film, based on a Broadway game called "Man," Lupino is a World War I widow who rents a room in her home. She is very active and happy in her community, though her husband has been dead for two years and is not ready to go on. The man who rents her room goes on vacation and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with the house cleaning. He is friendly enough to start, but later terrorizes her, locks her in the house, and doesn't let her answer the phone or the door because it develops violently and touches reality. The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of a movie that runs away when he finds a dead body in another house he works in. It is not clear whether he is a murderer or not because he seems surprised to see the body. It could be a divided personality, because when his personality turns to Lupine badly, he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it. He doesn't know that he has the keys to Lupine's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to the party he bought from the little kids who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Beware, My Lovely," is a very exciting movie, and both drivers are performing amazingly. "Tensions are developing to a very high level and ending in a way you don't expect.
