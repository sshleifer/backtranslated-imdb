Somehow, somewhere, somewhere ... GOTTA to see this movie. Breath with antennas and incredible excellent performances from highly talented actors. Do you think Cirque du Soleil is blowing your mind, wait until you see what these two women are doing - most importantly, the emotional journey and the fights of Jane's face (Dreya Weber) are universal in many women's motives. A superbly directed film that deals with the complexity of relationships and keeps you until you're ready to let go. This masterpiece touches both men and women. Ned Far (director / writer) and the ridiculously talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) just said honestly and honestly that he should say it. This movie hits a big one - see how you can - or you won't be "in the loop" when it becomes one of the most spoken movies.
