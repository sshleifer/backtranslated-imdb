Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the only directors in American film history who could accurately portray the frightening experiences of her in the form of a film. His pessimism and idealism, if it sounds somewhat strange to be mixed together, work as a narrator for him, and at the same time he is always outside to tell the truth, whether brutal (or embedded in melodramatic constructs) he can get. However, Verboten is concerned with the post-war experience, because in the opening scenes we are only getting into a great boom of war that is bold. The opening shot is like one big exclamation mark that seems to go on to the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera moves up, we see another soldier shot down in a war-torn terrain. Simple, straightforward language. Then Fuller interrupts the intensity with something interesting: the title song played over the introductory credits with both irony and sincerity, as well as Beethoven's music through firing between Americans and Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle continues and then passes to him to deal with his wounds. It could lead to the belief that it will be a somewhat conventional World War II film (rather in that one usually would not find Beethoven and, later to scale, Wagner put in these images), but this is not case. Instead, Fuller is a 'Coming Home' kind of movie, though not at all in the sense that 'this soldier comes home wounded and so on and so on'. Instead of going home, Brent will stay in Germany as he falls over his heel for Helga's wife (Susan Cummings, pretty good at getting rid of the German accent) and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the army so she can marry her. . What he does not realize is that a) he wants it more for money to get food for himself and his brother, but it becomes emotionally complicated at the moment of revelation slightly naive but sincere Brent, and b) there is the underground Hitler Youth Sect she called werewolves wishing to collect where Hitler ended - despite the arguments inside the group - attacking a government that is now in Germany to give them, as Brent describes, "blood transfusions". "With this, plus shots of the Nuremberg trials, and (as I said, I think Fuller himself), a quick, non-punch-pulled history of Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multifaceted view of society in the evil pitfalls of the immediate post-war environment. While Rossellini managed to do it with his own German Year Zero, Fuller can handle it with layers: first it's a love story, or what a tragic fall of a man who sees nothing around what he thinks should be reasonable, it's his the wife and child on the road they can't leave until the revelation that is (partially) deceived Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Day as the young, confused brother of Helga, appear with the utmost detail of emotion, not very easy parts of B-movie even though they may be, then it is another political layer, the struggle of society to cope with conquest, and the mentality that is sensational, certainly Full erem when it comes to making the Nazi a totally greyish place.: they are evil, especially when they cancel the reason for meeting their goals. Finally, there is a layer of style that is strangely absorbing. This is probably one of Fuller's "most sensible" films, which is not a bad thing because it is one of his best written scripts because characters do not speak simply or in too many phrases (except for a small scene where two characters talk about Hitler's youth as juvenile delinquents, which is, according to Fuller's autobiography, probably another layer to be considered in overtones and 50 years of movies). And Fuller shoots almost in real European style when he doesn't go into battle scenes or battles because editing isn't always very fast and sometimes it won't happen for minutes or longer. It is the strange tension that grows out of it, especially when there is something that says a character who gets more wild eyes or suspects; Fuller could easily go for great detail, but there's more ominous, cold quality to keep them from moving two people in the conversation without it being easy. But when it takes, as well as a great battle outside the US military office, or Nuremburg shots, which are associated with Franz's memories of werewolves, Fuller can be as a stunning stylist as ever. Very hard to find, but extremely worthwhile if you are a fan of director or World War II films that are taking place in Germany - or even a historical Verboten fan! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional experience with a cast that is better than expected from film B, and an attitude towards "another" that is just as damning and provocative.
