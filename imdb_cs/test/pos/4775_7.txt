'Steamboat Willie (1928)' is often misspelled as the first Mickey Mouse movie, although this title actually goes to 'Plane Crazy (1928)'. The source to power this common misconception is probably the episode "The Simpsons," which places the origin of Itchy Mouse in 1928 a short called 'The Steamer of Itchy,' apparently a parody of this cartoon. Interestingly, "Steamboat Willie" was itself a parody, the spoofing of the latest Buster Keaton release, "Steamboat Bill, Jr (1928)," although the link stretches little behind the title and general story setting. In this short Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse takes the river steamboat, much to Captain Pete's naughty cat, who angrily throws him aside. But Mickey shouldn't be ugly. Far from the pleasant, healthy Mickey, who enjoyed the newer generations, this little mouse cares only about numero uno, causing pain and resentment to a series of livestock to provide music for its own amusement. First of all, it's a laughing parrot who puts a bucket and big potatoes on his head. Then the goat is wrapped in its tail to provide the music ("Turkey in the straw") from the guitar she swallowed. A cat was swinging around his tail, a goose stumbled over her throat, and a piggy bank burned. For the children's drawing, 'Steamboat Willie', directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has some reasonable humor, though I also noticed similar elements (though not quite to this extent) in some later Disney shorts, like 'Gulliver Mickey' \ t (1934). Let's not forget Minnie Mouse, of course, who suffers from a treatment she could sue for sexual harassment today! Jokes can be rough and animation even more, but this cartoon brings a bucket full of laughter and it's easy to see why this little rodent has become one of the most popular characters in cinema history. If you are a fan of Mickey Mouse or Disney in general, this is one steamer you can't miss.
