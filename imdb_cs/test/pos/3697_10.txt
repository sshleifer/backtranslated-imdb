This movie is great The passion between Jade & Billy is unforgettable and the acting was great, that's why you don't leave 16 years old and a young man like this alone! It shows why a single mother shouldn't have a younger man with a teenage daughter in the house because he looked young enough to be Jesse's son. I give her ten out of ten, acting It was amazing and the movements between the actors were right. The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good because they were similar in age. Overall, it's a fun movie, but I think no one under 13 should watch this movie because of the sex scene.
