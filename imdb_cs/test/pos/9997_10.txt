Wow, here's another great golf movie. This is at least three in the last few years that I really enjoyed, it was well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend of Bagger Vance". This is the true story of a loser if ever one. To have an amateur defeat of all the pros and win a tournament in the United States, it's an unprecedented performance. I believe this is the only time in the last 100 years that it has been completed. How much of this film is fiction decorated with a dramatic effect, I don't know. I know I plan to read the book, and I know that in real life Francis Ouimet had a triple lead in the playoff with just two holes apart from what we saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anything. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's a wonderful story and filmmakers presented it great. It's not just for golf fans; This is a funny movie. Kudso for the director Billy Paxton for his outstanding work. Yes, much of it is just plain golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and a beautiful young woman who is obviously interested in him. It is also a moving story of someone who gives a small child a chance. The film also discusses Vardon's demons, who come from the wrong side of the track and try to make it an elitist sport that was at the time for Europeans and Americans. Shia LaBeouf is amazing as Ouimet, just like Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon as Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more invincible. In the movie, Vardon is portrayed as a warm, nice guy; a real human being. another major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a somewhat brutal ugly guy. The fourth main character of this golf story could be the most amazing person in the film: the fifth boy who ended up with Ouimet's caddy in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and magic to the movie. If all this - playoff with a huge loser against two powerful pros and after descending to the last hole - wasn't true, you think, "Oh, man, this is so hockey. Who could believe it?" This is what makes this story with a cheerful story finally captured on the film. Just like with another sports movie from 2005 - "Cinderella Man" - here's another excellent movie that has been unfairly ignored when it comes to the award. I think nice movies don't win awards ..... just the hearts of their audience.
