I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of this film is unmistakable, but the immense and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films as re-make 1998's Psycho. While it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and Connery's latest) Bond film is one of the worst of the series, the film itself is still standing alone, despite many other weaknesses. In addition, even a weak title song is made to fit nicely with the final film dialogue. Certainly, Sean Connery was at the age when this movie was filmed (at least James Bond standards), but there is a lot of evidence in the story that clearly shows that it wasn't entirely unknown to the creator. James Bond is not doing before retiring before his task, which has spent most of his time teaching, and there is a tongue on his face that insists on M paying more attention to his health, diet and training and more and more exercises. and what not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This guy is supposed to be a super man and all his fans are upset because he has some gray hair. When this boy leaves at the end of the movie, M sends the poor "Small-Fawcett" (in Rowan Atkinson's hilarious portrait) to tell Bond that he is worried about the security of the free world and you all without him. he cannot survive the fact that he is no longer a young man. Come on, Sean Connery could play James Bond as well as he could, or at least better than anyone else was able to. Most of the film deals with a sophisticated plan. steal nuclear missiles and hold hostages in the world (as Dr. Evil would say: "Oh, damn, let's just do what we always do?") so there aren't many new ones, but this is one of Bond's movies better liners. Is there a fun scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample? `If ​​you could fill this beaker for me? '' From here? ' There are plenty of good lines, but sexual insights on Mr. Bond are particularly prevalent in this installment. But then it happens later that the urine specimen fits into the face of the villain, so he screams like his face is firing. It's not a very good comic relief attempt, especially since this guy kicked Bond's ass with some kind of super-armor that could cut through anything. And of course, Kim Basinger plays in this film as one of the best Bond girls in the series. Isn't it a secret that he never says he never goes wrong again, and one of the things that has the worst date is special effects? with the only exception of flying rockets, which were apparently false but still impressive for 1982. Color contact lenses at the beginning of the film were totally ineffective, and laser watches were one of the worst things in the film. only to those damn sharks. Obviously, Fatima Blush put some kind of device on his diving tank that attracted sharks (assuming they had their own strange mechanisms), in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line, "I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN laser beams attached to their heads! And then, of course, there is an exploding scene of a hotel room that has been redesigned in The Simpsons episode, followed by another compulsory and overly informal one-component player from James. The dominance of the video game created by Largo, the villain of the film, is a particularly unforgettable scene, and the film also boasts of what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the series (far better than the funny in Tomorrow Never Dies) . But in spite of many strengths, the film's weaknesses at the end of the film are more pronounced in the mind of the audience, largely on the basis of the anti-Muslim submarine conclusion (one of the most obvious parts borrowed by Thunderball and less well-formed). It doesn't matter that Largo gave Bond some important information when he left him alive in the tower (Dr. Evil's brilliance, once again: "I'll leave him without witnessing his death and I suppose everything was going to be planned. What?" ), The culmination of what is expected to be a fast action film should never take place in a submerged underwater atmosphere. All in all, never say never Again, it ranks very high on the James Bond scale, and Connery's blink at the end of the movie (as well as the two closing lines) suggested at the time he could still return for the next round as Bond. It is clear that this is not very likely, so we can only hope.
