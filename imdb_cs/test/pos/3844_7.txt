The Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying a high life with their devoted human mistress, until the evil servant Edgar, with her eyes on the great inheritance, decides to make them and pull them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope with the unknown landscape and the smaller streets of Paris? Only by meeting the incompressible O'Malley cat, the rough diamond with romance in the heart. After getting the taste of a wide, dangerous world, he leads them home, and Edgar only gets his desserts at the wrong end of the horse. As always, it's more like voices than animations that are at the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant like O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is ... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most memorable turns are Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn old chases of Napoleon and Lafayette into a pair of bumbling Southern-fried rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar and the music numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-dude band are classic. The most notable point of view of the Aristocats is now how profoundly Disney's animation style has changed because it was at the cutting edge in 1970. Perhaps a nostalgic, dated feeling is merely the result of being lost in Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are fussier (pity) and animation and overall pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in a recent effort like Aladdin.
