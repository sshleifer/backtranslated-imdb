I watched it for the first time in black and white, around Christmas in the early 1960s, when it was featured on British television. I was totally addicted and I watched him again whenever it happened on TV (maybe only two or three times as it happens - if we had only VCRs!). As outlined by other contributors, the plot describes the return of the Hoppity Grasshopper, after a period spent away, to the American city of Forties. He learns that everything is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the "lowlands" outside the garden belonging to the composer and his wife) are now threatened by "human" people who are pedaling over a broken fence, which determines the property, using it as an acronym. Insect homes are flattened by their feet, and are also often burned by cigar butts casts and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his lovely daughter Honey (the Hoppity childhood darling) are in serious danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat. <br /> <br /> To complicate their problems, it is the sinister insect "property tycoon" of C. Bagley Beetle. Romantic designs for Honey Bee himself, and hopes with the help of his followers Swat Fly and Slap Mosquitoes, forcing Bumble to give him a hand in marriage. Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win the day and manage to save the community of mistakes from their terrible fate, and especially its precious honey from it? Enjoy classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy No" is a great, swinging, positive example), and color visual effects as the story unfolds. Time did not stop my fascination for this Masterpiece animation and storytelling, and I was very happy that it was released on video, although I later found it to be in NTSC PAL format. Never mind, I immediately posted on the video and then I bought a portable TV / video combination (supplemented with NTSC playback). Since then, I have enjoyed a lot of nostalgic views and even found out that TV rights passed from the BBC (who informed me that it is unlikely to ever show a movie at one of their stations) on FilmFour , who (at last!) showed him at his digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was absolutely excited when we watched her together - and that's a child who was affected digital age and resulting computer generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would like to thoroughly recommend this film for all ages, and especially for the youngest viewers. Give Max Fleischer a Posthumous Oscar!
