I'd like to give this movie 8.5 or 9. I thought it was just a straight up cheerful I don't know how you couldn't think this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was alittle a little bit a lot of stuff because I personally think that when they leave the bike and this is much more fun, but I'm sure there are people who think other things are very funny, so it's not my desicion, but so great movie they are going to see and after that it should definitely go buy it also if you don't like this movie that's okay because i'm sure there are many people who think this movie shows how to reduce our company Or what is my personal opinion and yours. Also, the Jackass box set is definitely something worth downloading or buying, or what you do to get your videos
