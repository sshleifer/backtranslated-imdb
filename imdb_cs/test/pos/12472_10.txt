Greystoke is undoubtedly the best tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert portrays a very believable man who is trying to return to the world of humanity alongside fantastic Ian Holm. John's fight to leave the jungle and the apes that resurrected him is quite mixed. Some very memorable scenes, including where Lambert makes jungle sounds to a romantic interest, and a scene where he witnesses the death of his monkey father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and you really feel it. <br /> <br /> Excellent and underrated film.
