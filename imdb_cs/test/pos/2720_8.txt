excellent!! Simply put, both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other, or maybe both are too good. This could be just her best performance as actor and best director Aparna. Yeah, maybe better than Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's (Konkona Sen's) older sister. Shabana Azmi of Anjali's character has done their utmost because she had to play a strong, responsible and arrogant role as an older sister who had full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen beautifully created Anjali's character, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. Mithi's behavior wasn't at all juvenile, because you can expect it from most Indian directors look at this role as if a lot of research has been done to understand the role of schizophrenics Mithi. When occasionally Mithi is a normal, sweet college little girl, she also scares you when she is shown sick .. as the parties were beautifully judged and played .. believe me sometimes reminds a girl in Exorcist .. not Total ..Marvellous Work Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
