At first I really loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I have to say that I was expecting more comedy than I actually got. But it was nice to see him in a role with greater depth and emotion. His depiction of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly done and unique. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was excellent in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on the spot, his world is turned upside down. He never expected to find a man who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving and sometimes funny. Plus, a place in the Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful. I must say that this dramatic comedy made me feel different emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to everyone and everyone.
