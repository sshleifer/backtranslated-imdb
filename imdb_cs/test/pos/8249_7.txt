When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, an officer of his release found he was working in a large city bank. When some of the underworld crimes of his past learn about their status, they plan to use it and rob the bank. Pinky is horrified at first because she really wants to go straight, but when she becomes a destiny fate, Pinky thinks she shouldn't look into a gift horse in her mouth. Also known as The Mayfair Bank Band (among others!), This is an extremely enjoyable piece that is the foundation of the 1970s. London and all his very dubious fashion are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes. If the viewer accepts David Niven as an eternal criminal of some anger (it's not easy, I can tell you), then Nightingale Sang at Berkeley Square can surprise you. The actors aren't sure to pull out trees, but they really don't hurt at all, they have a real fun that is never less than fun. Perhaps the score and soundtrack are guilty of being jolted during dramatic criminal moments, but it's a minor complaint that I'll let me think it's a British gem under the auspices of. Richard Jordan takes the lead role of Pinky (apparently hoping to be attracted to American audiences), the heart of the 70's heart Oliver Tobias is there to keep ladies interested while the guys are happy a look at Elke Sommer and her wonderful legs for the company - a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale, Nightingale singing at Berkeley Square deserves much better than a miserable 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but how many people have seen that I wonder? it good
