I saw this movie in 1954 on a two-bill with "Valley of the Kings." These films helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (I visited Egypt in 1975!) Today "Egyptian" is suffering from a flat dialogue and a few small touches, but it's a great movie we're watching - something that Hollywood, unfortunately, won't do anymore - and has a great story. not only the usual girl who meets the boy, but also the vengeance-is-mine. Too bad 20. will not reload the restored prints that will be visible on the Big Screen.
