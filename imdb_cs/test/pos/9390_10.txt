This film plunges into the realm of surrealistic La Lynch and Jodorowsky - with an atmosphere that is strangely captivating and that combines the intensity of its dreams. Narration is to be savored - the narrator is caught behind the image (adjacent to the bed), who often speaks for vocalizing his desires and reasoning. Yes, Beardsley will sound like that. There are some shortcomings, but its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The succession with the woman who was pulling out of bed and crawling on the floor trying to escape will leave you breathless. The film has fin-de-siecle air around it; and should be read as a disarming scream from the bowels of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bathe in it.
