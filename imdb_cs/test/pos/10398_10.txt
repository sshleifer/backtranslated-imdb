Here's another Antonioni that will be rediscovered as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it first (even in the metropolitan metropolis LA!) He ran for weeks and then disappeared (viewers from the art house chose their own special territory where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosity ). At first I was disappointed, I thought that the pace was unbearably boring, and that the man had lost his chance (Antonioni had been hard to find funding after years) to add another masterpiece to his canon; but when I knew that Antonioni was what he was and how I first responded to Blow-Up and Passenger, I refused to judge until I saw the movie yet. I came back the next day and I wasn't to be surprised that the movie was still dragging me in to realize the things I thought about and lost track of my life. for the first time, about forty years ago in 'L'Aventurra', creating a moody atmosphere in a characteristically and fascinating way alienated in tone (and quite comedic actually) that I couldn't get enough. The scene with Malkovich, who was sitting on fantastic colorful swings on the wind beach, with beautiful silver weather, and the Eno / U2 background track, which was just rhythm, was my favorite; it was still, but now the whole movie was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, a complicated simplicity, or an invisible complex that Antonioni's eye himself can lift and communicate with. The strange thing is that although it looks like some erotic pornography at first glance and has a lot of sex and crazy beautiful Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to distract you, this movie is undoubtedly the core of Antonioni. but you will not feel what a deep measure is until you have seen it several times and become accustomed to its rhythm. For example, it's a pretty funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something I didn't notice at first, but it was turned on by another critic, and he noticed that he was looking forward to the next glances (4 before they pulled him out and could) I came back for another one). If this movie was promoted correctly and people were to some extent guided by how to approach it, I have no doubt that it would be on the art circuit as most Antonioni films of the 1960s. But the 1960s are no longer and the film will have to find its audience on a small screen where half of its beauty is lost in the DVD version with the mailbox (if and when it will be released). I appeal to all general or esoteric film matrices to see "Beyond the Clouds" and add the magic of tragic.
