While researching Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) in connection with the Bonanza episode, I was alerted to this gem. This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably one of his best), one of his best. So this episode is responsible for some 'bests' - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. But that's "The Twilight Zone". More comments on the series are useless. <br /> <br /> "5 characters" is a typical Serling. Intense, dramatic, barreling towards the end, which is equally inevitable in retrospect, because it is surprising when you first see it. This episode is spoiled by one sentence and is too good to spoil anyone who is not seen. But you will feel ambushed. And you'll never listen to Hendrix with the same ears.
