A sweet, rich girl from the valley develops into punk from the alley and when his snobber friends disagree, she is forced to choose between heart and popularity. A very funny romantic comedy mixes with the elements of black comedy and 80's cheese, making it even more fun to watch. The film not only tracks the life of a girl in the valley and her punk; But her friends too, when they shop, party, hang out and go to the mall. If the weekly dialogue won't laugh at you, the music will be. Songs like "Johnny, are you Queer?" are located in the whole area. Elizabeth Daily is also a funny, existential character and Prom Prom and Queen at the end is cheerful!
