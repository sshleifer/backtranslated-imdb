I saw this version about ten years ago and since then I have been looking for it. I recently found the original version of VHS and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if, like me, you consider it one of the best Broadway music stages you've ever made, you wouldn't think twice. Why, it's just a little more than paying for a Broadway ticket. I really hope they will release it soon in DVD format. It's a piece of music theater that screams to see everyone!
