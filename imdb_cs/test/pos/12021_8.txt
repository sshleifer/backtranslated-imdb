Even though I saw this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd, who escaped from Newgate prison. In addition to freedom at the end, the film follows the true story more or less faithfully. The temptation to bend the facts, which are the hallmark of so many so-called historical films, is resisted in this film and filmmakers must be praised for that. The performance of Barely Poor Performance and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good is Stanley Baker as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as ever. <br /> <br /> Since the film is a fact, it is suitable for watching the whole family.
