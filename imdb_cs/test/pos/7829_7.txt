Snakes on the plane was such a well hyped movie that it was both inevitable and a little crazy to try to release another movie with almost the same name in the same year let alone in the same week. Reading the other comments I see the results here. A lot of people are upset. Crazy because it doesn't have the best special effects. Crazy because he doesn't have a star cast. Mad, because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say, "I'm sick of these M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes on this M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, that's definitely not Samuel Jackson's version. And maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> Snakes got lost between ponytail and horror, family action movie and a bloody bloody movie of death, Saturday night's artists laughed, while Jackson laughed so much that his grandmother covered her ears and would be traumatized by violence when it comes to children. , it was a cheaply produced horror movie on the train, of course it had snakes and certainly many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes with false sound effects. herself from the first scene. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the best fun Snakes had to offer, and I know that "... the Train version was a bit dry. But hey, it was a cold and unexpected story in the store. This little horror movie could be a lot worse than it did. <br /> <br /> For this purpose, he gets 7 out of 10.
