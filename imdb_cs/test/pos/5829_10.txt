One of the best TV shows out there, if not the best. Why? Simple: He has the courage to show us real life in prison, without clich√©s and predictable twists. This is not a Prison Break or any other show, in fact, compared to the Oz show Sopranos look like a children's story. Madness, curse, shots of explicit violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male genitalia and rape ... all this and more in Oz. But that's not the best part of Oz; the characters are the strongest point in this show; They are all excellent and uncomfortable, despite the fact that we are looking at brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorite are actors who play Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are so unique and change their behavior completely. And most of all they have no remorse. Overall, Oz is an amazing show, the best. Forget about CSI and showing about stupid doctors ... this is the deal ... OZ!
