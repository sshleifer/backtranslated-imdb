When I saw this movie at the age of 6, he was in the CHILDREN section of Erols Video because it was an animation. We watched it and it was a completely different game! Very violent storyline and graphic deaths are very fun and convincing, but not for children. Avoid family tracking, Mum almost had a heart attack and tore the video apart!
