This film moved me more than I expected, and I was fully ready to cry. Acting mainly carried this film, with excellent performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they stayed with me for the rest of the night, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. Costumes and cinematography were also magical, but they didn't end with each other. They didn't focus, but they added the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never have become my favorite movie because this title will always belong to an English patient but is in the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained quite unpredictable. I couldn't guess what line came. A heartbreaking story of humanity and war. In fact, this film was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable that it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to be true for all times.
