In my opinion, a vampire of "madness" has proven its worth of such infamous categorization. There were many sub-genre films from many countries last year. I've reviewed a lot and I've had a few more. Forgive me for your indulgence, but because I have recognized this trend as a phenomenon (which is, and is, my favorite horror). I'm going to move a little out of North America now, and I'll show you that it will mean movies you've never seen before. Of the many Twilight effects, the emergence of "boy" and "girl" is vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which results in the polarization of a whole generation of fans into "parties". I think men are prone to hate Stephenie Meyer's work (and her offspring) to some extent because they feel a sense of betrayal that the archetype that has always been is now freed. It is unlikely that women can enjoy future "neutral" photos because they have grown up with unexpected expectations that have been forced four times. We need more directors to create vampire films that are both able to use (unevenly) if vampires survive madness and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy Fame. There are two ways to disassemble it. Either it straddles the expectations of women and men and is generally only marginally pleasant, or it is a fake mess that does not determine which target audience it prefers, and therefore no one should perceive it. Do not let me convince you that the film has no inclination. Her director is a man whose fame is story-driven action movies. His protagonist is a man and has a passive aggressive interest in his lover (more on that later). But his desire for a woman he recognized before and after his mortal life is not neglected and his attention returns. There is a male tendency to this image, but it is not so one-sided that women cannot enjoy it. The same cannot be said about Daybreakers or New Moon. The story follows Emile Zola's novel Thérèse Raquin, which I didn't read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about an issue that develops between a married woman and one man. He kills her husband during a fishing trip and starts walking. Both of them are incapable of having sex because they represent a dead man's body. They are so mad to drive, but they care for a sick mother. At the end of the novel, he tries to kill, reveal his plans, and commit suicide. Now rewrite this almost 150-year-old French novel to modern South Korea and you are thirsty. Chan-Wook doesn't make that story enough to raise him. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are torn out by the story. His use of mother-in-law as a foil for their bad romance is just perfect. You see it. The protagonist is originally a devoted Christian who becomes a vampire after a bad blood transfusion after his volunteering for a new cure. It becomes a god he once struck. People flock to him and see him as a great healer. OK. This is really great and could be a great foundation for his relationship. Yet, little time is devoted to transforming it into a realistic figure of Christ trying to maintain his virtue, even if his lifestyle requires him to give up. Instead of confronting vicious people, he sipped blood from hospital hospitals in a coma instead. Let's continue the Christian allusion. A woman deceives a vampire man to kill her husband. Her overweight mother-in-law suffers from a stroke and eventually warns family friends of her daughter's betrayal (shaking her fingers). The man kills her, but resurrects her. Both of them invite former friends, and the woman mercilessly harasses people. The man says he's enough and decided to go to the beach and force her to wait for him to sunrise. They both die, but for their crimes (and their own, but the film embodies her more prominently) atones. The character of a woman is a cartoon and her profession offers an explanation of her behavior. She is a housewife without education, while a man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism increases their properties. It becomes a monster that one would expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists look at themselves and her life is how religious people see those who do not have God's intervention.
