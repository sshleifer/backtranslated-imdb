Now it's the type of movie we used weekly. Today-and-days is rare to see drama that depends on casting talk to each other. There are no explosions, car chases or chases, there are supposed sexual situations. This is not a movie for the younger crowd, it's for those who appreciate people who talk to each other, a lot of argue because we spouses who have middle life problems. Emily Watson & Tom Wilkinson are a seemingly very happy middle aged loving man & woman. Living in this small London suburb, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his wealthy father. Of course she would meet Emily Watson, it would be easy for everyone to beat him. I will say nothing more except that the credits start with a fatal accident, the rest of the movie is about the consequences of this accident and all the lies that individual characters tell. <br /> <br /> This trio and the others are excellent. Julien Fellows wrote a screenplay based on Nigel Balchin's novel. He also directed, this was his first directorial attempt and he did very well. All production is the first speed. The film had a few months of theater run at the end of 2005, it is under 80 theaters. This is a pity for me, silly comedies open up to a minimum of 2000 screens, but really good dramas because it and many others open up in just a few. By the way, there are some very funny lines about certain situations. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 (of 4) 95 points (of 100) IMDb 9 (of 10)
