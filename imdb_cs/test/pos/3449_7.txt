This film has something to recommend. David Hewlett's paintings, music and naked ass are wonderful! The story, the story of redemption, forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and moving - and it is not predictable, which is much said about the film today. But it is mediocre, the direction is confusing and the scenario is just strange. He often seemed to be a parody, but I never figured out what he was trying to be a parody * *. And if it is not a parody, it will remain a movie with great potential that it does not live.
