Frozen Limits is a big canvas for artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British entertainers who formed in the early 1930s. The main band was six men Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. The lovers of the then royal family were also very popular in the variety halls. The plot is seen here as the Wonder Boys, who went on to search for their wealth in Alaska after reading about the newspaper's gold rush. The only problem is that when they finally reach Red Gulch, they turn out to be 40 years late! Often, when I see the statement "it's very British", I often cringe because it means that those who are not the British Isles can try to get it. The reason I'm worried about me is that at this age of www / internet I got a collection of celestial movie loving friends known to divide their parties into the best of Ealing, Will Hay and imperial Terry-Thomas. So is it true that something like The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by any British audience? Yes, it is true, so much is the current British here, but it really needs to be said that the classic film fan is quite well versed in history, and when everything is said and done, the visual merriment is universal here. With the anarchist "no" so wild west is the absolute winner. A winner who has every chance to be more appreciated by an American audience than a British audience. Not all comedy works, and in fact "big 6" are trumps of great time movie stealing Moore Marriott. But there are parodies and parodies that deserve respect and nod to the more famous comedy acts. It is unlikely that you would crash from your chair as if I did it because of the Ottoman gag, but if you are a fan of the classic comedy? I'm sure the worst recognition is that very talented people work here. 8/10
