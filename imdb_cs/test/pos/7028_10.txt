I first saw this movie with my fianc√©e many years after it came out. I thought I'd hate it, but to my surprise, it's so cheap, it's great. We spent many hours reenacting parts of the movie ("Sylvia? Yes Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you had to see that baby. Sometimes in this world we see things we don't want.") Every time I imitate Neil, my finances break up. Also music is classic and fun to sing with, especially on the roads. Of course, I do not admit anything to my friends. It's like guilt. I'm really watching Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's always just as good. Jennifer Gray is also cute in this movie. It's too bad that her career never went.
