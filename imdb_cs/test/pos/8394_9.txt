I'm Big Gone With The Wind nut, but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind movie and Scarlett mini series are so different from books. Away with the wind, he left so many things in the film that were in the book and did the same with Scarlett. Both movies were good, but I liked both books better. Scarlet left so many characters, and the age of some characters didn't seem to be in line with the book. Time lines do not match. Scarlett realizes she is pregnant on a boat in Ireland, but she realizes that she is throwing in Savahanna. Also, Sally is made like an ugly monkey like a woman in a book, and the film cast Jean Smart to play it, which of course is not an ugly woman. Scarlett is a good movie and helps anyone who has been disappointed by how Gone With the Wind ended up to see what might happen if Margaret Mitchell lived alone.
