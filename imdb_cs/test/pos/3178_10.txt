Up and coming was a very positive sitcom who brought the instrument / and the channel that opened the young mind to black culture. Focus and outlook was a message of positivity and hope for change for our people. I recommend this selection for every American household to experience wrestling and reward. The show never gave a chance to flourish into the middle class of blacks who are the owners of businesses. This matter was so compatible with the real life situation that affected the lives of so many people. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored, and put on DVD for Americans to enjoy with their families. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
