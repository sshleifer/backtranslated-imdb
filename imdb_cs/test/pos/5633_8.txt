I enjoyed this one because I can apply to it. Suddenly in my life I tried to make movies and experienced many of the same problems that Mark Borchardt did in an effort to create an HIS movie. And I also went through a lengthy period of suicidal halt where I refused to grow. But then I miraculously married and had children. I realized that being a film director would most likely not feed my family. So I got a decent job and I did what I needed to make it happen. That's what a mature, responsible adult does. Mark has not yet encountered this reality and so is an adolescent retarded in this sense. For this reason, there is hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems to be so impolite and self-deceiving that he doesn't realize how bad he is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and compassion for him and his circle. Mark has children and ex-wife and bills to pay for, but the film captures him basically just about his "artistic vision". Despite this, Mark appears in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many things that are necessary to succeed both in life and in career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial influence, and so on. any appearance. I think we should feel encouraged by the viewer's attitude of this "noble individual" of this noble individual who fights against the chance. And to man, what are the odds! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are descendants of large film or television people; no doubt everyone will want to drive a day if they are not. How much space is there for an independent Mark? It's like watching a guy hit in the head with a board over and over. Think about it, it's pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen doors, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in every movie. Despite these doubts and seeming criticism, I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and told me that in real life these guys are just as they appeared in the movie.
