1. I saw Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks often with a high voice (reluctantly funny!) - not convincing Hamlet and his directorial qualities - poor! (see also much of what is too little about Branagh - the humorous parts of the dialogues were mostly cut out when directors 'talks were not about directors' mistakes!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the script is an interesting idea - but so miserable Actors - All 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - he seems to be a little crazy - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - beautiful and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe the actors they say - I think it's the best compliment.
