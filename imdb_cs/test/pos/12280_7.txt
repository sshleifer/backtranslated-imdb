The copy of this movie I saw is not very good. It is grainy and in some parts has almost no color. Toggles back and forth between English and French, often in the middle of a sentence and sometimes in the middle of a word! To make things worse, there are no English subtitles in the French language parts, which I think is at least a quarter of the film. It is amazing, however, that the film is still very understandable and entertaining, even in this state, and I think it says a lot about how well this movie is made. <br /> <br /> This is a top Western spaghetti great actor, an interesting story and an excellent musical score. She also has a great hero, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and a general feeling of melancholy. This film has "Euro" written all over it. <br /> <br /> I hope there is an untouched negative or print this movie somewhere because it deserves a quality DVD release and when it comes out, I'll be one of the first in line to enjoy it!
