I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leaders, Miller and Carlisle, is amazing, sparkling so well and creating an unlikely Duo comedy. Alan Cumming is cheerful, his enthusiasm for this role is evident when he camps. Acting is excellent and it is a really entertaining and moving movie. It's not the biggest movie he's ever made, I admit, but it's a huge amount of fun, and I would recommend to those who like other brave British. It includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go far wrong. Watch out for portraits by David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: Profile Fame.
