For some reason I always like movies that people hate when they don't really think they're so bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this movie, I think it's too overly criticized, I'm not really that bad of a movie. In fact, I think it's one of the better sequels. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally murdered Jamie Lloyd (who was captured by a "black man" in Part 5) after giving birth to her baby. Then we are introduced to the Strode family, which now lives in the old Myers House (which changes in every movie). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, now an adult boy who has survived the original murders. They have to fight together to save Jamie's child from an evil cult that takes care of Michael while Michael himself is driven to kill an old Celtic ritual where he has to sacrifice the whole family in Haddonfield. This is definitely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I don't understand all the hate that got. It had some nice tension, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I confess), some frightening moments here and there, and lots of gore and knife cuts to keep you all calm. Not all the acting was great, but it was pretty convincing for me. Marianne Hagan is a leading lady and is very sympathetic. Paul Rudd plays adult Tommy Doyle and is also very talented and plays his role nicely. The rest of the support cast (except for the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much praise, but it was not bad, all things were taken into account. I'm still not sure if the explanation for why Michael was killed was absolutely necessary, but in the end it turned out to be all right and I wasn't upset about how they tied everything together. The open conclusion was also a kind of fright, but it could have been more. I also saw the infamous "Producer's Cut" of this movie, its original cut, and I think in some ways it's better. This further explains the curse of Thorn, which drives Michael and has some other scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was much better in my opinion. It was more natural than the conclusion we got in the studio. I wish Dimension to release this alternative version of the movie because I think it's better. Chances are they are very slim though. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will delight all fans of the series. This movie isn't the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth it to rent it if you want to see Michael. Do not wait brilliance and enjoy it. 7/10.
