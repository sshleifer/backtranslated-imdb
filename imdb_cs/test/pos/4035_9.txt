"D.O.A" is an engaging and fun little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is best at his caustic; and Quaid is unfortunately one of the most untapped talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, he really doesn't do much of the impact. The film is styled through, drawing on a variety of influences to capture its "sea" feel. Could you appreciate that it is actually controlled by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is great, from innovative cameraman to incredible use of black and white photography. All these elements help keep the steering fresh. Indeed, the greatest excitement here is to be with dialogue, it's elegant but complex, it doesn't lose a word and yet it is fun to be. The scenario for this is like a pocket art work. I hadn't noticed this for ages before I finally caught him late at night. If it's the first thing you heard about it, don't leave it like me! Catch it soon, it's a really top-notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid genre movie that will surprise every step, it really fits the bill. /> <br />
