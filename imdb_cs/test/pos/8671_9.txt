Andreas comes in a strange, inhuman place where everything seems perfect. He gives a good job, everyone is kind to him and everyone, and he doesn't even find much in finding a beautiful girlfriend. But in this unnamed city, Andreas will soon discover that the perfect world of commercial types is not really a paradise. I really saw one of the better films this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a clever direction, where each individual component (cool desaturated photo, cool symmetrical design, unmistakable gameplay, slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps to create a unique strange atmosphere that keeps viewers to the end. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh, I think they can only do the best movies. Nothing new, probably in the analysis of a modern civilization of a de-humanist, but a really clever work with big, surprising ideas that are hard to forget, from which he was lucky to see it. Just a beautiful scene in the subway.
