After a very unsatisfactory part 3, I wondered if I should bother with The Next Karate Kid while I saw why this saga should not go on and I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most of the second and third Karate Kid movies. While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very nice and the story is catchy and warm one. Hilary Swank, is this girl coming too far or what? She plays a rebellious girl who has lost her parents in a car accident and when Miaugi "watches" she says she has karate skills. It offers more lessons if it becomes more serious in life. Of course there is a boy who loves her and average tyrants that are quite similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br/> 7/10
