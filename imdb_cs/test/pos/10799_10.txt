From the shift I knew it would be an amazing movie, pace, cinematography, Dallas personalities, character diversification, not to mention director Oliver Stone and, of course, Eric Bogasian ... The film starts on Friday (firstly suggestively occult) and begins with radio station in Dallas, where their talk shows, Barry Champlain Show (based on Talk Radio Host Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric Bogasian) is an abrasive radio host and his work is that it is mandatory to pontify all the sensational nuances of the radio audience that feeds on his show ... Trying to confuse himself with a lot of social deviations that have become lonely, vulnerable, obscene phone callers who have a masochistic desire to be publicly defamed, Barry Champlain is effective in dealing with this insecure ilk, by debating them socially rather than simply subjecting them to a mere admonition ... New techno logs it serves a stigmatic purpose for a radio audience in Dallas and the most important concepts go back to perversion, talking about "baseball scores, orgasms and folk pets !!" The whole thing is cacophony of drug induced diatribes and potpourri for psychopathic paranoia! This high-profile cannon feed is something Barry Champlain is doing !!! Swirly pathos, scattered moods that have emerged from the insanity and perpetrators of pornography and the overall pop culture, serve as an unstable ammo for Barry Champlain's battlefield! The setting of this film is perfect in that it is two thousand feet down in terms of ideology. In central Dallas, the prevailing sense of cosmopolitan consciousness is 20 miles away in a major chapter in Ku Klux Klan !! ... The game is based in Denver, this is where the real story takes place, other small theatrical plays depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film takes place. I thought it was a great choice! ... This film illustrates how people have a horrible and misleading and deadly misconception about the Jewish people in America, where they control banks, their agenda. it is different from each other and their intellectual literature leads to perversion! These prejudices represented the overall dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal atonement is that he is incomprehensible and unresponsive to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate distrust, that's what makes the film so credible !! The characters in the movie were well portrayed, Dan, a tailor tailored for middle man hatchet management (played by Alec Baldwin) who was constantly watching Barry Champlain's every move !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will constantly feel Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is the recipient of Barry's anxiety and selfishness, but he cannot completely give up his feelings for Barry, regardless of the path of personal destruction he closes. The radio audience in Dallas is a melting pot of socially poorly placed retro-bates who are demented by their own real flaws !!! ... Partially, everyone who has a suspension, including Barry Champlain's own suspension, is what Barry Champlain does! ! His audience ogles corruption, encourages improvement and eventually becomes a Barry Champlain pet project for prescribed sinners !! Social culture conflicts have become the fall of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> This movie is excellent! In my opinion, the best picture of Oliver Stone, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers .. This statement will tell you how spectacular Talk Radio is ... The story of counseling and playing and co-production of Eric Bogosian is just convincing !! Camera angles, dialogue, spooky figure depiction, all the top notches .. The camera is amazing at the end of the movie! Dallas has a dubious distinction for being considered a mega metropolis ... So now, like Los Angeles and New York, there are cracks cases too many to count, cheap housing neighborhoods from hell and budget cuts that will mean that will be. a significant number of people who will be dead next year !!! The city has its lynch radio listeners who have put a pejorative spin into the wonders of nationwide air traffic! These are the culprits in the movie! Ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet a big evil wolf and their decadent curiosity morally destroyed "The Last Neighborhood in America"
