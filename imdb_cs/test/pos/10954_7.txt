17/01 All I can do with this film is improvisation on my impressions. I wasn't given "changes", I don't know "scores", and I'm not trained in the genre. I've always had trouble with chord changes (trumpeter, you know), so I was pretty limited to doing basic "keep the melody in mind" and ad lib around it. What stuck to me about this incredibly whimsical black and white blues figurine was the knot he gave me in his head and heart as I tried to figure out whether to go with the set or choose a path along the tune (story). went with the melody as usual; I've been lost to the changes - too deep, big, probably over my head. Yet he tried to keep up. I admired acting actors on the theme and story. I didn't see any things or things that others would look like: I didn't feel the light skin trying to "pass through" as many times as she had forgotten the color problem or tried to ignore it - first: later she returned to the fight. The distraught pale complexion of a young man (his trumpet bored the ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent, and - perhaps his best feature - distant. What, I thought, after the shadow curtain closed on this provocative song - is it the basis of such a thing? Is it a way to find "reality" by setting up a stage, peopling it with distinctive characters and giving them a tune and theme? Is it more real or truer than a well-designed scenario - without benefiting from editing and revision? Is improvisation heroic, "artier"? - moreso than created work? Where is the greater or brighter truth: in retrospective art / craft or in production and reformation? I am still lost on this issue. I loved the movie; I lost myself in the cool blue misty evening where I had to go home and go to the corner. Guess what? I broke out in the twelve bar blues riff, tried and true - I couldn't say goodbye to the melody. Reality is just too scary. jaime says to give them 7 or more. I'm at a break.
