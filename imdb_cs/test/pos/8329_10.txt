Walking with Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses amazing visual graphics to display live dinosaurs. The information provided here is astonishing. The mood in the series is changing to keep your attention, things like dramatic music when fighting breaks out. There is clear evidence of one cracked document! The greatest predecessor of writers, directors and producers, and don't forget the others involved. If you come across this video in stores, I suggest you buy it not only for graphics, but it offers for the extreme efforts and productive work of the series. 10/10
