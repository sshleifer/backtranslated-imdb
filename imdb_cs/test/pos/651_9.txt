I remember watching this film over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Although I haven't seen it recently, I'm sure I would enjoy it as well. His very light funny movie ensures that someone laughs. The situation with each of the characters was so fun and imaginative! I especially liked the girl who traveled with her mother's ashes (who eventually picks them out on the highway after the blast), robbers and nuns. This nice humorous style is much neglected these days. Also this film showed that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of Our Lives) was on a great start. I recommend it to anyone who is lucky enough to find him in his local video store.
