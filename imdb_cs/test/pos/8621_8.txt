It is very hard to come up with new information about JFK Jr. Casting was very good and the script, though a bit like a documentary, was also good. The only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. Perhaps the two-part film could tell us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationships with his mother, sister and other relatives. Some material in the book, "American Son," Richard Blow would increase the film much. WTBS should be appreciated for producing such a fun movie.
