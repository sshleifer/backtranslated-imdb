One of the best teen comedies I've ever seen has been accepted. He has an original script, a talented cast, and brings an hour and a half of pure, undisturbed experience. It tells the story of Bartleby's high school graduate "B" Gains (Justin Long), who has not accepted a fictional collage in one of the collages he asked to avoid parents' disappointment. In an attempt to deceive his parents, he will completely create a fake website and turn the old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until many more "hired" students appear on his doorstep. Now he and his friend must find out that the collage is not only for themselves but for others. Justin Long as lead man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and supportive acts are excellent - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh and simple, and most importantly funny, right from the start to the credits. The story goes so easily that when you stop laughing at the last joke, you start giggling at the next one. Along with the whole entertainment movie brings a very common theme of our attention, ie Collage Education. Usually, if filmmakers join a school government, they are united by the desire to go to school and learn. Yet this film does not mark all the other schools as bad, but only shows that there is another way. Those Who Say "If There Is A Way There.And Sometimes Kids Can Know Better What They Need Than Their Parents. <br /> <br /> This movie is an unacceptable little story about a great life opportunity packed in the best possible format.
