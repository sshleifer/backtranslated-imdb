There's only one racist joke in this short Daffy Duck that's basically when Daffy rides on Black Beauty, he's a black woman. I understand in part why this joke was included because at that time few people knew how crude it was to be racist, not even illegal to discriminate against blacks yet. Besides, the point, "Coy Decoy" is basically a fun, interesting little moment when Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I really liked this short (despite the other reviewers here). The way Daffy is so in love with the clock duck is vaguely disturbing but at the same time very entertaining. Porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not important for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people in those days thought of wolves, bloodthirsty, horrible animals, which of course were never (if not hungry). I also liked the animation style used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are completely at Daffy Duck and for people who don't mind occasional racist joke in cartoons, enjoy "Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
