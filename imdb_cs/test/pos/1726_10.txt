Unlike most people who commented on it, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester McCoy and I couldn't compare a two-century doctor who initially. I really enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and continued the series. Since then, I've seen old Doctor Who episodes and some who were great, but like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate. A 21st-century doctor who is great, I thought Martha was great, almost for a doctor, and if Jack's appearance is something going on, he'll be brilliant when he appears on series 4 or 5. <br /> <br Speaking of Jack, spin, Torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programs (though it's definitely more appropriate for kids). But if you insist it's not the same and it's not just Doctor Who, please stay in the cellar. <br /> <br /> 10/10
