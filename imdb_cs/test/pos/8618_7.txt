Catherine Brreillat is a French director who likes to provoke her audience. It will lead us to see how the film is performed on the spot. The film in production seems to be based on itself because Jeanne, a female director, is in the center of the story, just like Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts like an alter ego of a real director. At the beginning of filming, Jeanne reaches a dead end. Not only did she choose the wrong time to make this movie during a cold spell, because it is a beach place that is too cold for actors and compars. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially the male lead, who has trouble with the director's decision to show him in the film; the main actress is not even an angel. Making a movie, Mrs. Breillat tells us it's a process like no other art piece. First, it is a period of writing in which, in this case, Jeanne, he wrote the game on the screen that when he goes into production he reveals the problems that the writer / director did not think. There is a problem as he wants to photograph a love scene in which a young woman has her first sexual contact. What seemed clever on the written page does not necessarily translate into easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a fake penis and has a lot of trouble accepting the touch that must touch him in ways that never occurred to another person. Illuminated Anne Parillaud is great as director Jeanne. It gives production observations, actors and crews that fit well into the narrated story. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play major actors, with all the uncertainties some actors bring to the film. Jeanne has to massage her egos to get what she wants. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, assistant Jeanne. "Sex Is Comedy" allows Mrs. Breillet to give us her own film. This is a great view of how films are made in the typical Breillat style.
