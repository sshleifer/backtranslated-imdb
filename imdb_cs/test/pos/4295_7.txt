Well written script. A moving story depicting the middle class of English at its best. Some great actors Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be gentle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress with whom I was unfamiliar, but she does a great job of awarding her to play with his wife ******. Director Julian Fellowes was not subjected to typical Hollywood tricks to get the film a foul story. It's not too dramatic, it's an image of an English middle class. The movie's pace doesn't hesitate even if it's not facing the pace of the movie. A good twist on the property, it is not predictable Beautiful English rural village setting. I enjoyed this film very much. Places were also very well chosen. If you love relationships, it's one of them. It's better to have some tissues ready!
