Universal Studios "Flipper" (1996) is a great fun movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentiment. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle Porter Rick in the Bahamas. This eventually changes the lives of teenagers and grows up in the process. They learn to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the '60s and the NBC "Flipper" TV show was my favorite children's show. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as the Sandy Ricks of the 1990s and provides excellent performance. Just as I liked the NBC TV show and the MGM theatrical feature films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature best! I feel that Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. With regard to Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more gaming talents and more acting as an actor, making his performance outstanding and credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and did an excellent job as a writer and director of the film. Paul Hogan gives a comic and sympathetic performance like Sandy's uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly compensates Elijah's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 UA) was. The director of the photo was Bill Butler A.S.C. who in 1975 directed the film "Jaws". Mr. Butler is a very talented cameraman. The underwater director of the photo was Pete Romano. He did a great job with underwater cinema. I enjoyed the movie score by Joel McNeely. This good film score featured Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This film was shot in Panavision as "Thunderball" in a 2.35: 1 aspect. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the "original" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small role in this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. That was a very kind gesture on Mr Shapiro's side! As you can say, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this beautiful film met with the harsh words of most film critics. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, May 31, 1996, at the cinema. That meant a lot to me. I have it on many video versions. VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD at 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong that is "letterboxed". But my most valuable asset is the "original" 16mm theatrical feature that I will be a treasure for the rest of my life! I thank Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and all those involved for making this an unforgettable movie for me. <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the universal DVD is excellent! It's the best DVD I've seen. The color and resolution is spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal had to use the same DVD conversion he did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm print is a "mint" and Alan's movie has a really beautiful look. Great tribute to the wonderful movie! DVD resolution is even better than laser quality! It's just spectacular! Thank you for being a universal home video for quality control and transmission. Many thanks for doing a great job on this wonderful family movie. Also, many thanks to Alan for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It's a real honor to know you !!! (Review revised / updated on 27 June 2005)
