The movie is really cool, I thought. It keeps on the original game pretty well, and some of the battle scenes are displayed in such high detail, it's incredible. I thought the movie might be a little better if you gave us a little more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what's going on on this movie. CG is beautiful, I don't think they could do a better job of wise graphics. Every little detail, the way they move, how their swords look, everything is perfect. The way the characters look is almost the same as if they were real people. <br /> <br /> Music was great and I found it fun to listen to how much of it was remixed from the original game, new tools and effects. Everything and all, I recommend this movie to anyone looking forward to a quick action and a good story. I would definitely play the game before I watch the movie.
