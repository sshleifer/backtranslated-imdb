"The Cure" is a very moving and moving drama. The film focuses on two neighbor boys who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. In spite of Erik's fears, boys become good friends. The film shows the way boys find the "cure", which is in Ohio by "National Investigator", and how it affects their relationship. Acting is amazing (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra do better), and the movie is just moving. I couldn't stop crying with my shoe. That's a good tearjerker. Keep kleenex nearby. 8/10
