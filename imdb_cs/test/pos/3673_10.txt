I totally adore this movie! I've never heard of it when I saw it in a video store. I saw that Kathy Bates was in it, so I thought it must be worth it, you know? I saw it for the first time when I shook my head. . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I smiled so hard. I clicked "play movie" and I watched the whole thing again. It's no doubt a movie I've ever seen. The more I watch him, the more I love him. It is absurd and crazy and sweet and expensive. Kathy Bates is great, but the rest of the cast is also wonderful. What special characters are all! The idea is too fun for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a funny movie. I want to see it again. Whoever is watching it for the first time, please hold it to the end. It's worth it!
