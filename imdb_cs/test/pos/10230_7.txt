I enjoyed this movie. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. In addition, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! I wonder if his real-life personality is exactly the same (with the exception of killing of course). Creation for this movie amazed me, though this movie probably had a somewhat low budget. , mutants / creatures / monsters look great, especially since 1990. This is definitely a unique movie and not crap. That's for me wanting to go find a novella it's out. This is an interesting movie because it shows how people can be monsters and "monsters" are the only ones with humanity.
