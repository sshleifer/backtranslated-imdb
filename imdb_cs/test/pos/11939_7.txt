- The Best Bit: When a blunt gangster (Nicholas Turturro) calls a fugitive (Matthew Modine) "Shan! .. Come back, Shane!" and when the older wise man asks him, "What are you doing ?!" he plays simply "enjoy my time!" Actually like me at the moment! Worst part: I've been thinking all the time of the observation: Where did I see the girl before? where? where? Until I found out while the final credits .. OHH MY GOD! She's (Elizabeth Berkley) .. From fiasco showgirls! But I couldn't make out with clothes! To tell you the truth, I felt a short tremor. She is really cute and pretty, but maybe Hollywood doesn't love at all! - The most sexy bit: When (Berkley) says, "Do you think things that Boner gives you ?!". <br /> <br /> - The Hardest Thing: A retarded assistant after day and night at the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !! In addition, Mexican smuggler took 3 shots (in the same car!) and is not dead either !! - The Most Ugly Thing: All of those murdered people, as well as numerous (F) departments in a dull range! The Most Beautiful Thing: A crazy smart script with all the funny characters and stormy situations, acting looks sweet, especially from (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show (as he had the best dialogue!). The Most Disappointed Thing: Although the direction did not mention the story of his witty at the same time, he did not give him a unique touch, an unrivaled signature, some crazy merriment like the one in the story itself. However, maybe low production did it well! And, of course, easy-to-taste music that could be such because even cheap production! The Most Confusing Part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what did he do just to be out of the Hollywood star list? What could be what he did (or didn't!) To end up in a light independent joke like (The Shipment)? The Most Dangerous Scene: Where (Jose) the Mexican smuggler finally went? I thought we'd see him again at the end, smuggling once more as a surviving little criminal who could, in such a short trick, materialize the continuous failure of such a world. <br /> <br /> - The most questions I had after the end: When do we see (shipment - 2)? As I am so eager to see that fine little comic hurly-burly atmosphere again! These were my own answers.
