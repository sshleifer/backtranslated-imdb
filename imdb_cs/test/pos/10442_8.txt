When I watched this movie in my teenage years, I tried the soundtrack. Some bands from the soundtrack I didn't know yet. However, during the film I noticed its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. Quincy Jones, Commodores .Sensational Soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, this film has been on TV for a long time. Today, he passed on cable television and I remembered accessing the web to make a comment. The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but it's what's going on in real life. Not always what he thought was ideal is what happens. Life brings us a lot of surprises.
