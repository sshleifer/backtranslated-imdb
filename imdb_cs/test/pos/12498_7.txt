I'm torn about this show. While most of the parts I found are HILARIOUS, the other parts that I found are silly and just a shock to the shock. The parody of the walls of some cartoons is brilliant, as well as many scenes with children. However, I don't think it's smart to get the little kids to say rude things. It's not that I think they are "poor children, they're being exploited" - it's just that it's not really smart! It's something ANYONE could do, so it's as simple and meaningless as making a paper plane. For this exhibition to be better, they would have to adhere to the children's natural reactions, which I think could be more fun than time written. By far the funniest part of the Wonder Showzen is Clarence, a blue puppet who wonders about the streets where he talks and harasses strangers. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. When I saw him on the long scene of the importance of patience, test the patience of an extremely patient man. You should, however, watch this show though, because in all it's very funny, though it is stupid at times.
