Ray is one of those movies that makes you stop. In fact, you are thinking about what you have heard or thought about what you have read about this man, and that has not come close. In my first observation Ray, I forgot that I was watching a movie I felt peering about watching this man's life through the window. This film is so convincing that it pulls you in and includes all your emotions that you go after the emotional ride on the roller coaster, and when you quit, you don't want to do it so soon because it has such a kind of emotional punch that other movies are missing. Jamie Foxx deserves his Oscar and quite rightly so his performance is spectacular and should act as a standard for anyone who wants to make a bio pic soon. This film is as good as the subject that deserves both classic and legend.
