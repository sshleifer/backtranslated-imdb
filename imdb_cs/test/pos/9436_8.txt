Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) opens the story in disguise, helping to smuggle the famous physician "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the Nazis who want his bomb plans. Of course, the Allies also want it, and Sherlock is here to help you. Dr. Tobel invented a tool that greatly enhances the accuracy of bombing. Holmes and Dr. Tobel arrives safely back at Baker Street, but the scientist would rather be alone, for some mysterious reason, though he promised the English to help them, not the Germans. He remains true to this promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and English along the way. It's a fun movie and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can get when he stands up against his opponent, "Professor Morita." One complaint: if it were evil, he should get rid of Holmes without firing his eyelash instead of escaping him. It is quite sad even if the ordinary fool Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) several times to save his boss from a certain death! Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story, but if you manage to hold your brain several times, it's a fun movie you're looking at. . This makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals, especially night shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: the one who made the English subtitles here misinterpreted or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy job and not the first time I've seen this whole series watching on a restored DVD set.
