When I first saw this movie in a department store video ... I was intrigued. Since I thought I was in love and I was at the same age as the youth in this film at that time (though I realized they were old enough to be my parents now), and the sound an escort written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before they "made a big one" in North America ... I thought I had nothing to lose when buying. I wasn't disappointed. So far I have shown it to many of the people I have been with since then, and to my current friend ... apparently they did not find it as beautiful as I did. .. prefer to call it "cat" movie ... but i still laugh and cry. This movie has been overlooked tremendously. It's good to see that it's available for rent at one of the local video stores, so others can share magic. So maybe it's a little far more appealing ... but it gives you a slight sense of innocence ... and a renewed belief in love.
