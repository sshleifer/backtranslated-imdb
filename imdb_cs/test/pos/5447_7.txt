Leno speaks through her punching lines. It spoils the joke, for those of you who came to it. His show takes place in a micro studio for some reason, or for two reasons - a small amount of laughter will be amplified and a few want to see it. Letterman's set is a polar opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. NBC, cheap NBC, never gets it. The founder David Sarnoff's megalomaniac is still about money. At least CBS has some family feelings about it. Leno collects cars, or it's a stamp, while Letterman is racing with cars. The difference is informative. When I talked, I used to ask other chatters to send me an email if Leno _ever_ said something that was fun. I've never received a single email. Letterman has excellent timing. He also can re-use the most infallible joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night show. Letterman has built another career. Paul is now well known and respected in his own music law. Even the rest of Paul's band members gain recognition and career advancement. Biff Henderson has become America's name he knows. Even businesses in the same block as Ed Sullivan Theater get support. What did Leno ever do for anyone else? Personally, I am glad Dave moved and Leno got a Carson concert. I had never seen NBC before and had no reason for it. <br /> <br /> The Top Ten list is an American icon. So is Letterman. Leno is a cartoon dream, nothing more.
