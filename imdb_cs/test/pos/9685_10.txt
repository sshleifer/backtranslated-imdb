This film was bordering on humor. I can't believe these people can get rid of it. Johnny Knoxville didn't cross the line ... he stomped it all! That was better than the first ... EVERYTHING ALSO! On the first film, I found that the shenanigans are somewhat like the t.v. show. TENTOKR√ÅT NE !!! they completely did 180 degree flip ... the whole cast is so great at what they do and not stunts ... but the music basically fits into every situation ... GOOD WORK !!!! When you go see it do not forget to use the bathroom before going to the theater, keep a strong stomach and rememba to make your nose spray.
