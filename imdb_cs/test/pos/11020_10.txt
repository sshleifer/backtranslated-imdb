I like movies about unpredictable people. "One fly over the cuckoo's nest" is perhaps my favorite time, so one can imagine I was with this one. Certainly not the one who would watch if you want to leave with a smile. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright scary, even after multiple views (because this kind of thing can really happen). He will certainly keep you at the edge of your seat for the duration of your journey. And after you see the end, if you are not deeply disturbed, you should really look at the pulse. Acting was phenomenal. With his extremely extreme touret case, Marcy goes from unpredictable to utterly frightening, occasionally appearing out of control that he looks undead. Seth was also great. The focus of the film is not nearly the same as he is on Marcy, even though he is the one who gets the most momentum as a flowering figure. It's a classic love story with some unusual twists and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance". There are two bad reviews for this here, but one of the people who gave such a review did not have his facts straight and admitted he did not see the whole movie while the other was just looking for some Hollywood excitement without deep characters (and maybe it was a little thrown away by an apparent shallow nature, because the ultimate goal is to steal the black bobbi head from the toy shop). The point is that this film is not for those who want to see something "normal" or "light". This one is broken and india how it can be, and won't let you go to a heavy peak.
