Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but I was interested in BREAK UP. It is true that the story lacks critical details in several places, but I was still researching the Fund for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she did not let me go. The look in her eyes in the last scene of courage, literally putting one foot in front of the other towards her uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and significant examples face to face. I believed her completely, perhaps because I knew and admired several "harsh bullying" survivors of similar offensive situations. And they did it without becoming men, but this is my own promising projection of Fonda on BREAK UP.
