A low-budget but unforgettable by-shock shock, which instead arises as a bizarre theater. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a separate psychiatric hospital and is not fully aware that the only reasonable people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly hovering around her. The lack of a decent budget really gives filmmakers a little more than a sense of style, as well as casting ugly characters. The pleasure of this film does not come from film shocks, which are quite tame, but from a strange atmosphere. First we have a deceitful woman who thinks her baby doll is real. There's also a judge murdering an ax, a war veteran who is shocked by shock, and old Mrs. Callahan is like anyone who is an older grandmother. A young patient named Allyson gives a new meaning to "nymphomaniac". Big guy named Sam is only a little slow after a slow lobotomy and Jennifer suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts. The only other sentient person on the spot seems to be Dr. Masters, but has a secret? <br /> <br /> "Don't look into the basement" is a great example of low budget movies. There is not much plot going on, but cheapness works for the movie. Several cast members will play an unforgettable performance, especially Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds some strange details to the movie can really keep up with you. The scene between Allyson and "The Phone" is a classic for all times, and Dr. Masters' facial expressions are especially excellent when she starts to go over the edge near the movie finale. the cues that evoke the characters they accompany, my favorite cue is a "crazy" cue, a sitar that always jerks when one of the patients does something pathological. <br /> <br /> The way Charlotte is alone casts on hysteria at the climax that Dr. Masters is just another prisoner, and then suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to act on her delusions (she certainly has a soft grip on reality, why she would not otherwise question the ominous lack of telephone service or external contact) The scene where Charlotte will be able to finish barely a live Dr. Stephens with a toy must be one of the biggest low-budget moments Yes, "Don't Look Into The Basement" Could Be Very Well "American Beauty" Grade Of Garbage.
