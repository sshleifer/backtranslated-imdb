I just got back from Santa Fe. NM. I visited Loretto Chapel. Looking around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I looked again at the film version of the staircase. This is a stunning mystic that occupies this building. It's about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a story on the subject that is a staircase story. I read the whole story. I was immersed in the atmosphere of the people in it. It was as if we were completely locked in a timeline, all with the same thoughts and horror. When we left, silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. NM.
