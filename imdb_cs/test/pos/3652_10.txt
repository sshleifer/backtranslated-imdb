I saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most beautiful movie - the best I saw in a while. The tempting character of Isy is open, exploring and (as stated in the film) loving person - helplessly portrayed by beautiful Camille Natta. Accompanying music is soothing and transporting, balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Every character seems to be in conflict in some way - and their interactions (w / conflicts) create a great story. The Story of A.K. Hangal as an old man was most magically done - I wanted him to go on and on. The fact that Hari seemed to remember his "place" during the added strength to address the story - a refreshing change of bubble - the headline of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> Everything, great movie. Go look.
