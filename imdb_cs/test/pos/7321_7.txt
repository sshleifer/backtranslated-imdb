Director Leo McCarey's younger brother is quite a bit of the three Stoogs nominated for an Oscar. Here are the goddess doctors named Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine and Dr. Howard. They are not the brightest doctors, but they benefit from doubts if they handle duty and humanity. I liked this short. It's not one of their best, but some moments are merry. One joke that repeats more than once works every time. The part where the hospital chief has to run is amazing. Telling more would spoil some jokes, so you have to see it yourself. Just another great piece from three Stoogs.
