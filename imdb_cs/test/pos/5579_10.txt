How can I categorize Farscape without resorting to superlative blasting? Okay, here we go! The scripts are fantastic, with each episode offering so much fun, drama, humor and utter attention. The cast is perfect, especially the fact that Zhaan (Blue Lady) plays Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that just isn't in Star Trek. I think it has an Australian spin show it's for me, Australia has been knock out quality movies for years and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first four episodes okay in the UK and have the quality that makes every 45 minute show (in the UK) stand out more like a movie than a weekly TV series. The episode that really means to me is "I, ET", which transforms the extraterrestrial concept around Moya (a live ship, even a spacecraft has a great character), is forced to land on the planet, who has not yet done "First Contact" and is surprisingly similar to the country, and Crichton meets the radio telescope operator and is a "little green man" to them. Gripping things. <br /> <br /> In short, the effects are great, the scripts are top quality and the main characters (not one of them really gave more importance than others) are interesting, not always 'good' and well done. <br /> <br /> Take the second season!
