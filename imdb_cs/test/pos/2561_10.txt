I decided to watch this movie for one reason and one reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I love him a lot. I didn't see any previews or trailers for this overlooked movie, so I entered it without real expectations. Jackson did not disappoint when Lazarus, who is in a maze that is on the South, and perhaps added his strongest performance ever, including playing and singing a lot of great blues tunes. The real surprise, however, was Christina Ricci, at least a real-life vampire head that took over the role of sexually abused urban hiker Rae and made her credible, almost even sympathetic. Watching a non-sexual relationship between Lazarus and Rae was just amazing. Justin Timberlake, a pop star, wanted to become an actor, he should go back to causing "wardrobe faults" and popping up the pop scene. His predominantly forced performance was, at best, distracting from the real story. <br /> <br /> This film is raw, rough, and sometimes quite "on the face". Not everyone will like it. However, those who do this will quickly move to the top of the favorites list.
