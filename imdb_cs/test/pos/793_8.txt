Not everyone, but most of this story is Buster mistakenly considered "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. There really is no story, just a series of adventures that showcases Buster's physical talent, which is amazing and his comedic timing. The 27-minute film is basically one adventure at a time, which usually involves someone chasing our hero. Roberts, a nasty cop - and Father Girl Buster is interested - who's chasing him. These last scenes were the best I thought, with many clever gags involving a hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton in his best sense. It's just a half-hour madcap that makes sense, but cares? It is Buster with his best slapstick, or near her, and so serves its purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie was made, people (like me) are still discovering and enjoying these quiet comedy classics! Cold!
