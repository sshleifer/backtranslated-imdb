I was looking at this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things that I remember very well are introductory sequences and the theme song. In addition, everyone was ideally occupied. Writing was also very strong. Also the performances were excellent. I hope a network returns it, so I see every episode. Before I wrapped it up, I'd like to say I'll always remember this show in my memory, even though I haven't seen an episode. Finally, if a network ever brings back, I hope you catch it one day before it looks good.
