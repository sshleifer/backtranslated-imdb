I watched The Dresser this evening when I saw him once, about ten years ago. It's not a "big" movie and it's not trying to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of two conductors is just leaving me without speech. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing but amazing in this movie. Dresser is the story of Mr., an aging actor Shakespeare (Finney) and his chest of drawers, Norman (Courtenay), a valet. , giving on production King Lear during London Lightning in World War II. These are two men, each of whom is dependent on others: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman to stand in the cabin, whispering and bullying him to get to the scene for his 227th Lear show. And Norman lives his life indirectly through the Lord; without Sir needing him, there is nothing or he thinks he is, anyway. <br /> <br /> It's a character-driven movie; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires the highest caliber actors to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is absolutely believable as a very old, very sick, offensive, bullying but brilliant theater actor. He hissed and smoked at his teammates, even when they took their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as a coin dresser who must sometimes act more like a mother than a valet to his older employer. However, the employer is in fact an incorrect term for use. But even if their relationship is technically an employer and employee, most of the time they treat Mr. Norman and Norman like an old couple. Yes, there are others in this movie. But there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay and Ronald Harwood's amazing script. However, this does not mean that there are no other good performances, especially Eileen Atkins, a long-standing manager of Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old pity, and what could be. Although it is not talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nomination for Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates) and best adapted scenario. I remembered that this was a good movie, but I wasn't ready to be as fascinated as I was from start to finish. If you want to see an example of what is great, and have fun all the time, then I urge you to see The Dresser.
