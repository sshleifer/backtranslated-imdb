I give the whole film 8/10. Visually, much of it is nothing less than stunning: the artistic director's dream mix of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid testimony to the power of film as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, form, images, environment - and fabulous decoration of sets, combined with the latest computer graphics. So, 10/10 to do it! Wow! The rendering line is, well, more predictable. You know she'll save the girl and ultimately the killer, but the story is still interesting and enough to pull you in and keep it there. 6/10 for that. Pick up the factor ... I'm not gonna give this rating, but the movie must have narrowed me, and I watched it on the video on the TV screen. Of course, this would have a much larger impact on the big screen. The graphic violence of a twisted erotic nature in a surrealistic landscape - albeit beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world inside the killer's head isn't - thank God - my world. Since I watched this movie on video, I could play several sequences and for the second time I noticed that I was admiring when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene could go, and I think the whole movie is worth seeing again, just for "visual art". General Suggestion: Do not take children or conservative grandparents to this, but if you are interested in the visual appearance of movies, like surreal art, don't mind a little eccentric gore, and just want to make a little "mind trip" this one is the winner. Yeah, and if you're interested in girls, Jennifer Lopez is pretty hot. <br /> <br />
