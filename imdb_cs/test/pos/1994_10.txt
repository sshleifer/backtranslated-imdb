David Cronenberg, like David Lynch, is an acquired taste. The director, who plays topics such as reality, perversion, sex, madness and death, is required to get the most extreme audience response. He has made films like Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (Major X, Major Z) and recently Spider. It is best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try to read too much about the plot, or it will be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg will take you to a world of video games that act as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behavior. Living a fantasy is something that people always dream of, but how far can you go before reality becomes blurred and the imagination takes over and turns into a nightmare? These are topics that touch eXistenZ, exploring identity, the human psyche, the physical bodies that are attacked by the disease, and most importantly, the reality itself. The story and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows his business very well and successfully revives the artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s associated with stories like this. The film shows some disgusting things, but is unusually low in the gore department compared to other Cronenberg works. The shock effects on which they play are never on top and the course of events is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intelligent movie ever, but let you think about it, think and quite confused. The actor gets two inches up. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their games perfectly and cleverly portray their moods and identities. Dialogue may seem somewhat outdated and occasionally clinical, but this is part of the effect that Cronenberg intended, creating a dishonest and extraterrestrial atmosphere that embarrasses you. Supporting actors like Ian Holm, Don McKellar and especially the fearsome Willem Dafoe are raising the film even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances. blood-curdeling frames and existentially deforming story, you will love it.
