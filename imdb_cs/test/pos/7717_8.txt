How exactly homosexuals dominate homosexuals in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gay Hindus and Muslims, there is little hope of ever leading a life that they accept and support their otherwise very close families. This is the main point examined in Chicken Tikka Masala - probably named after Western Spicy Food including menus bits of young chicken! Jimmy is a typical young Asian girl raised in Britain by her traditional parents with common narrow and selfish views of marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led into a structured marriage that seems inevitable, even though he is clearly gay and deeply involved with the very attractive young man he lives with. He knows the truth must be said, but he is worried about the consequences, especially because his father seems to be terminally ill. So he becomes involved in a fraud network that becomes wider and wider as conspiracy develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and not judging or promoted to any group. Acting is generally excellent, although it may seem a bit of ham in places where the director is rather looking for humor than letting it bloom naturally. There are no prizes for photography or script, but the film is all made up of amazing sentiment expressed at the very end - sentiment that all fathers around the world could learn from it.
