I have to admit to this film that I'm afraid of dummies now. hahaha. but yes, first of all, the games in this movie are quite swollen, at least according to my standard. Most actors are pretty decent in their roles. The script also seems pretty good, there are some kitschy things as well, and some decent writing and some damn scary scenes. I'm still going to tremble to think that one scene with a guy and a dummy. brrr. Yeah, I'll say you should check this movie, it's pretty good and very fun. good watch. 8/10
