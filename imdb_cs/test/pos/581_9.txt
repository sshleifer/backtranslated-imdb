As Muppet movies go, it is easy and clear the best. It features a lot of portraits of great named comedic age stars, a solid script, and some great Disneyesque songs, and mixes them together in the culmination of Henson's best talent display. The story is basic and jokes are multilayered to entertain both adults and children who have been marketed without being exposed to ideologies that their parents may not find desirable. <br /> <br /> This is just fun, but it's also a well done, well written, beautifully persistent classic. <br /> <br /> Rated 8.9 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
