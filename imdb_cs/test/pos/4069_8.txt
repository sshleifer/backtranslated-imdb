I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many of them are probably missing. I've noticed that many reviewers call this typical "buddy" movie. De Niro is by no means Murphy's friend for most of this film. In fact, part of this movie's comedy is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with someone. Murphy really shines in this one. She is back in what she does best, behaves like a complete ham. He's a cop who wants to be so much an actor and looks forward to a reality show. De Niro is perfect as a direct man who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought they both had great chemistry and are the perfect casting option. Rene Russo is also great as a television producer. Of course he loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro as well. Many reviewers touched the cheerful scene with William Shatner, which brought him his role as TJ Hooker trains Murhpy & De Niro to act as cops. But my favorite scene includes Murphy in "confession," hoping he could get a policeman Wesly Snipes-Like to get in touch with De Niro. Man, that was merry! Often, comedy depends on your personal taste. Of course you could talk about holes in the plot, most often with comedy. I was nervous to see Murphy and De Niro pairing ... I think it brought the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him again at the top of his game. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
