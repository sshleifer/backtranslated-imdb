If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this movie. This is given. Why would no one want his films to be unfamiliar to me, but for those who do not see the light, they simply avoid it. <br /> <br /> Everyone else: This is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a lively, clever, BRITISH Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck acts like Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual diffuse, angry man, Roger Rees is a great combination of fluster and violence like "Mervyn" Sheriff of Rottingham and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield, and unfortunately underestimated Matthew Poretta are perfect cheerful men. There are similarities to Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why would he want to change his style when it works so damn well? The links to pop culture in this movie are old enough to be funny again ... at least from a 16-year-old perspective. It's a complete and complete parody, a game of laughter every second. Some of them don't work, but mostly and well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the movie! Of course, if you didn't barraged to your style with constant visual and verbal gags, you wouldn't like it. It's not the Academy winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is to get into it. If you want nonstop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters and catchphrases last a lifetime, watch it.
