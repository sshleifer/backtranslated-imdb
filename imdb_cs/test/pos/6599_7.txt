That's a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I don't like skateboarding or skateboarding. But some 2 hours later I was interested in this film. I wouldn't call it the most interesting movie of all time, but for some reason, when the guys talked about how their skateboarding clubs and skating started in those empty Southern California pools, I was interested. I should also add that the music in this movie was also pretty good. I do not sit around the desire to hear more of the 70s rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what he was talking about.
