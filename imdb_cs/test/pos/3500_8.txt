By persuading the prime minister to support the totally unsuitable Ali G as a Staines candidate in local elections, ugly Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, allowing him to seize power. But to his surprise, the plan is declining, Ali is accepted by the nation and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to guarantee his political future. Pensive, rude, misogynistic and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, a large-scale debut drive for Berchashire Saxony's Baron Cohen, is all these things and much more - which is my kind of movie !! there are those who just will not joke, and certainly there will be people who find risqu√© jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography and attacking queens in the regions (it is unnecessary to say, should Stay Well Away!) But if you find such youthful humor party-generous hilarious, they are a fan of Baron Cohen in general, or just want to see Rhon Mitra's hottie in her underwear (and you shud, cuz she fit well!) then I highly recommend spend an hour and a half at Ali G and West S taines Massive. <br /> <br /> They are bad!
