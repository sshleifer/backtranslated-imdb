Yes. Bam called several times and Englund. And most likely, too. The entire cast is back in action, and Knoxville has intensified to become the true leader of this gang of botched retards (I mean the best way possible). At first I thought Bam or Steve-O were the main guys ... well, the main man is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everyone, and I think everyone is great in this movie! You are laughing right from arrival and believe me, do not plan to rest your smile. Personally, I think the movie definitely has better moments than the first one. You know when you go to the theater, and you don't want to have high expectations for it ..... well, this movie blows all the expectations away. If you love Jackass, you can go with great expectations. No matter what you laugh at. If you don't laugh, the reason is most likely someone who has a gun in your face that tells you when you laugh, you're dying, or you're embarrassed about the sound of your laughter or the highest probability you ate Jack Sh! for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is prepare for a film after the movie. :)
