Hi I think this movie was great and had great graphics and I was glad they used the final fantasy 7 I think the game was the best I've ever played, it's a great movie and I loved it. they should use the final fantasy 7 again or the final fantasy 10 there both quite scary from: Tyler Sheena hope you can email me back if you have any details if there is another one .people for anyone else read this I recommend you see This movie is animated, but it looks pretty realistic and has amazing fighting scenes I haven't seen in the movie for so long. The final fantasy game 7 is also really great, not good graphics, but its really fun and challenging game
