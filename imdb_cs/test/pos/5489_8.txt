Wolfgang Peterson's In the Line of Fire is a cunning and sometimes truly white knuckle ride, though one or two times we might feel like we were on similar paths before. How could one not, when Clint Eastwood, just after (supposedly) closing a book on his Western heritage, has probably closed the one on his brave detective images (don't count the blood work there). But there's more to it than that of Eastwood's character, here, the mysterious, demon-ridden and hard as nails of the secret service agent, has a slightly charming side to him, even a more romantic side that one never sees in pictures where he knocked out his trademarks. There is some complexity going on here that does not rely solely on a common swagger, and it is a note-worthy for how such a possibly resourceful back story (not rescued by Kennedy from being murdered in 63) is made somewhat believable amidst the rest. his personality, who is more than likely hiding his wounds - most of the time. Eastwood goes to the city to become a great presence in the film, and under these circumstances, the character seems to be tailor-made. However, there would be a risk that his part in the film would be slightly conventional (we still get scenes of "Harry type" that they are smarter - and as a clever ass for everyone else in the room who are excited and told to give up the top brass, here the Chief of Staff), including here to protect the president, who (wisely) never really sees or does not know at all. Even a romantic sub-story that is somewhat subverted, if there is some machismo laughing there, would subdue the picture a little if the second quasi-Dirty Harry aspect didn't come out: indelible villain. This time there is some extra Hollywood tension, but intelligently intelligent tension (almost smarter than the rest of the film deserves), with the character "John Booth", playing Oscar nominated John Malkovich, as someone who is described as a predator rather than a killer. It's the way it could be wrong with Eastwood's character, but Malkovich might top some of his former villains' counterparts by being extremely cold and non-assembled (there's a devastating scene where he kills a banker and her roommate). as his past is revealed, there is still the "what the hell is with this guy" element that keeps the audience and agent Eastwood estimates and moreover paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance, gently fearsome and always measured at the level of madness and professionalism. In addition to conventional points, it's also an elegant picture from Peterson and the company, and it's close enough to Don Siegl's realism. But Peterson also has a couple of movie tricks up his sleeve, which sometimes grimaced me; whenever someone puts such a shameful but exciting tribute to Vertigo - jumping from the roof to the roof, the hero hanging from the ledge, 'twist' - that still gives me some trembling. There are also telephone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depth of the game of cats and mice, probably another kick in the ribs to Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal dangers and crisp formalism at the top, it is also a character in some ways, and everything is fairly done to give viewers a fine, at least a sense of tension-film. Eastwod's a great leader, Russo plays a woman's possible love-interest honest and mature, and Malkovich's upstairs. There are also some notable supporting roles too, and a fine studio score out there. One of the best films of 1993.
