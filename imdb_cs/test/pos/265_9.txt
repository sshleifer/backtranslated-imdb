Vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on copy. Unpredictable and often surprising, it's not the best of Brady's movies (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), even though it has a unique charm. The well-written story covers several dead ends, but mostly surfaces with a new chart high. You know from the beginning how it will end, but when it comes, it is a sincere and very open end, a realistic and plausible ending, the end looked like a start, a pleasant one and let me want more.
