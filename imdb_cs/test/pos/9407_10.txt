I thought this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Skakel. I found everything about it to be great, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, scripts and music, etc. You have already been warned! Micheal did this from his brother Tommy's jealousy when Martha refused him and instead took Tommy. Fortunately, however, he was captured a few years later and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although I think he should be sentenced to "natural life" without the possibility of being released. Kudos to cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
