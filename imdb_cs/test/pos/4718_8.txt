It was high time a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar had to be made and Beyond Rangoon's Hollywood response. Initially, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the 8888 rebellion events and would add traditionally the Titanic-style Hollywood spice to the leading heroine and Burmese male leadership that became old. Fortunately, there was no such thing - which can also explain why the film was not financially successful. But the film was sincere to God and I was glad to dedicate the accuracy of the events I described. . Aside from being shot outside Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand, and having missed an exotic Burmese country, I can't find many mistakes in the movie. <br /> <br /> For despair, you can't blame the film and the resulting stunning actions. It's over, the real events of the Civil War. Hans Zimmer's music is definitely USP's otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection with her. I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this turbulent time. When I heard a movie that was written on the basis of my experience that I was too young to absorb, I had to buy a DVD and I wouldn't have to say that I could hardly struggle with it because it was overwhelming to me surprise.
