The brain of blood begins as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country called Kahlid approaches death due to cancer, but if he dies, Kahlid tears without being led, so Dr. Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) & one of Amir's devotees Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) devised a plan to take Amir's dead body to America, where the mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body and with a little plastic surgery that no one will ever know was even dead. Things don't go as planned, even when it comes time to transplant Amir's brain Trenton's crazy assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body to someone who has fallen off the balcony, Trenton needed a strong body and because he no longer decided to use Gore's body as a temporary gap until he found more appropriate. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in her new body, she's not very happy with what she sees, I think you would be if you found out that your brain is inside a badly burned madman? Also Known as Brain Damage, Brain, The Revenege & The Undying Brain, this left-handed film was created and controlled by the only Al Adamason and, frankly, I am offended by the pathetic 1.5 Brain rating of Blood on IMDb, personally I think it's amazing fun in so bad it's a good way. Kane W. Lynn & Joe Van Rodgers's Highly Fun Screen is as stupid and stupid as it comes from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazy mad scientists, ranging from 7 feet of high scarred freaks who play with toy cars to a 4 foot tall dwarf medical assistant, from cellar basements to roof chase, from car crashes to assassination, kidnapping to screaming terribly clad women, from Regina Carrol's hairstyles, who should get their own mention during the opening credits for teenage girls trapped in the basement of the laughter -out-loud merry end which contains some profound meaningful speech! It's all here and the blood brain has quality cheese embossed throughout it, if your bad fan low in budget flicks with a sense of fun then this movie should be right at the top of the list 'must see' movies. Despite the fact that it is only a tiny 1.5 reviews I am proud to admit that I liked Brain of Blood a lot, I thought it was an absolute horror that looks, slows down a bit at the end, except for a few shots of people roaming around doing nothing. Specifically, but until it was like a rocket, for just 85 minutes it's pretty short, it's hard to guess the Burmese plot, and I think it's a lot of fun in the camp. This is the director Adamson's masterpiece when it comes to me, along with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971), which he shot a year ago. Those who have seen the Adamson movie before knowing about any existing production values, cheap special effects & cardboard sets & all this makes fun, this movie handles that subtle between incompetence and seriousness to create an unforgettable viewing experience. I love the opening film of Kahlid, which is probably just a photograph of the Taj Mahal in India complete with statues of people in the foreground! Regina Carroll's hair seems to be a separate entity on her own, she seems to change styles between shots and is frankly horrible, don't get me to start her makeup work, no matter what she needs to use a spray gun! There is another cheerful moment when we see Amir's body being transported to America wrapped in what looks like an ordinary tin foil, why I ask myself why!? The effects are variable, there is a horrible-looking false spider, Gor's burnt make-up work is pretty bad, though it is surprisingly bloody removal of the brain, which is actually quite impressive. The budget for the blood brain must have to admit that I thought Trenton's lab was pretty good with different computers and medical devices, though the rest of the movie looks cheap and ugly. The production values ​​are low, the music has been taken from another Beast of Blood (1971) and the acting is terrible, but in a camping fun form. The blood brain can have the best title for exploitation film at all and, as far as I'm concerned, it's a very funny piece of nonsense that I had a great time to watch and laugh. They just don't have / can't / will not make them like this anymore, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I liked it, but then I'm weird again.
