The film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day), who is a former stage singer, and their young son - my guess is about 10 years who travel through Morroco for leisure. On the bus, blow to the French government agent, and they're a little too nice to him. After finding out the information he was looking for, he is killed in the market. He wants to communicate this information to someone, so he goes to the only person he knows to be James James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say that when he says something about what the agent said, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London because that is where his son is. The film is very exciting. There are many twists (a typical Hitchcock film). It also has the right amount of comic relief. In addition, she won an Oscar for Doris Day "Que sara, sara." This movie is very good. It's hard to find a problem. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all the thrilling fans. I just give this movie "A" just because it's a bit predictable.
