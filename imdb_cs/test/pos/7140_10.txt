this is more than Sat. special afternoon. Very well written if there is a very low key here is a lot if you look at it. For example, catch a cat companion / scout. Not only could it be a comic book that was supposed to be a comic book. The comics industry (as well as the film's publicists) missed the boat. One of the least known really great movies. John Sayles's great script is a strong point, but also a good one. Probably the best "super hero" movie I've ever seen. Short for special effects, but long for credibility. This is a breeder. I've never seen a DVD of this movie, but I used my own version of VHS. Good hunt
