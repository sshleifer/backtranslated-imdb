Michael Kehoe has done a pretty good job, especially given that it's just his second start as a writer, producer and director. In general, the "first timers" lack vision and direction when "Dominion" proves in production of the main production that Mr. Kehoe is in Hollywood! The Dominion boasts beautiful scenery and boasts experienced members (especially Thomerson and James) who, with extraordinary clarity, communicate Kehoe's extensive vision. Few movies can combine a slasher / horror genre with a real action / adventure feel, but the Dominion has finished it. This film will certainly qualify as one of the best films in both of these categories. If you're looking for a quick action action with more than moderate tension, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. Great!!!
