Sometimes the Academy does not recognize or suggest the potential of some films because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated but they do not win anything (I hope this will not happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened to "Boogie Nights", which was the best 1997 movie. The Academy preferred the best Oscar "Titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and an award-winning "Good Will Hunting". "and irritating" Full Monty. "Other images that were nominated in the main category were" LA Confidential "and" As Good as it Gets ", great movies, but" Boogie Nights "are getting better and should be remembered in more categories This amazing film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly large performance), a 17-year-old bartender who catches the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, acting actor), a porn director. to help him get into the world of pornographic films, change his name to Dirk Diggler and start making a huge success, but fame ... does not last forever, and other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, Perfect), Buck ( Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who accepts anything but has to wear roller shoes. <br /> <br /> What could be a trivial, trivial movie transforms into a perfect, unforgettable film in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson.What makes "Boogie Nights" such a great movie is its performance, added to a clever, well-written script, a great soundtrack, and so on. it has its meaning in the context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of modern American film. "Boogie Nights" is a powerful, impinging image that should be seen by anyone who really likes cinema. Under the plot, which seems to be trivial in the first impression, is the amazing story of the heights and falls, the things we face in our lives. It is an amazing portrait of the late 70s and early 80s, exactly at the age of heights and falls. That's what makes this movie so special and real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
