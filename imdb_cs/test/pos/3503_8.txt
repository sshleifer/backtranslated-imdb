Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Though the film is almost not in the quality of TV-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously bad moments! I liked Ali G since I saw the show material. I think it's one of the best comedy characters of all time ... there with it, say, Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this movie was that they really have some serious actors (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will absolutely respect them even more because I have a good sense to accept this chance. I have nothing wrong to say about this movie, it's very funny. Very youthful, but hey, so what?! One more thing to Mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
