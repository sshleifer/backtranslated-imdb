So much I enjoyed this little musical fantasy and bought a copy to share with my friends. It's a nice and diverted change from our secular lives ... I believe we can all benefit from an active life of fantasy, from joy and forgiveness, I highly recommend it! Performance is excellent and music uplifting!
