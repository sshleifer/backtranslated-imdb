The film begins almost painfully slowly, "romance" (yawning), which seems to be going off course (all parts of the plan ...) Then about an hour into this festive movie is a holiday. It's worth paying attention to the first hour. The holiday is still festive but funny. Suddenly downloaded and slightly petty characters come to life, and everyone (you and characters) leaves a sense of experience. Women will love it. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the deep faith shown by the characters. It's not my favorite movie of all time - after all - without the dinosaurs OR laser beams - but certainly the movie I liked to see. Do not miss. Jim
