"Out to Sea" is an entertaining movie that features the wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as funny as their "Grumpy Old Men" comedy, but there is a lot of laughter. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-law sailing together. Once they reach the ship, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau signed them as a dance host, so he doesn't have to pay for the cruise. This annoys Lemmons, who has no mood to dance. Worse, Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. However, they go along with it and that process they encounter some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there is cruise director Gil Godwyn, playing the handle of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" veteran Brent Spiner, who acts like a bad dictator. There are two fellow dance hosts, played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran musical music star Donald O'Connor. There's a shipowner, Mrs. Carruthers, playing "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As far as passengers are concerned: Vivian, the widow, played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz playing one of my favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, mother Liz, starring actress Elaine Stritch. They also meet others. All these actors are pleased to watch Lemmon and Matthau play. It's great to see Cannon here, see them as beautiful as ever; Stritch is hooves; Spiner is a funny comic criminal who plays deadly straight; De Haven is amazing; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are as normal as usual. Nice little gemstone comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (of four)
