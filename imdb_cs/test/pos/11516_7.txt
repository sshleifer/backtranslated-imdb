The "Lights of New York" originally started as an experimental two reel Vitaphone Short, which eventually rolled into the first feature film. Helene Costelle was reportedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and a sister (in my opinion, the real beauty) of Dolores Costello, who seemed to have all the breaks. Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this grim movie that has revolutionized Hollywood. Broadway. Hairdressers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that their barbershop is soon covered by illegal smuggling activities. Soon they will realize it and regret the day they left their small town. All they hold is the loan Eddie's mother gave them and they want to go back. Eddie will meet Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello) again, a girl from his hometown, who has made good progress on Broadway. Kitty is worried about Miller's "Hawk" (Wheeler Oakman), who is still around her, but Eddie, innocently, thinks she is exaggerated because "Hawk" already has girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to assure her that give her a small gun to scare unwanted admirers. The "Hawk" who killed a policeman and closed "Feds" decides to build Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is pretty good with the "Hawks" handling her and after clearing where she tells her she is after the chicken, and not the old hen's scene is set to - Murder !!! The fact is, it's not completely horrible, besides gangsters and showgirls alike talk in their best elocution voices and that is still going on in movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (if he is a diminutive melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were fine and were the most seasoned actors in the cast. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore to see - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the darkness they came from. I also didn't notice much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects ie a phone or sitting on a couch before they could engage in a conversation. The people who saw it in the cinema probably began to think that all the policemen were talking in this flat monotone because this trend continued in many early interviews, ie "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of everything - with singing and dancing - a film in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
