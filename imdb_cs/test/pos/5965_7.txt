Many animation enthusiasts consider Wladyslaw Starewics to be a great forgotten genius of one particular field of art, a puppet animation he invented almost without help. . . and, as it happened, almost randomly. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than in cinematography, but his unsuccessful attempt to shoot two deer bugs led to an unexpected breakthrough in filmmaking when he realized that he could simulate the movement of manipulating beetle bodies and photographing them on one. an image. Time. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz's incredibly complicated classic short THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he shot in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation of all kinds was in its infancy. The Russian Revolution's political storm caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - coincidentally? - was a dark political satire known as "frog" or "frog who wanted a king". The tension of black comedy can be found in almost all Starewicz films, but here it is really very dark, focusing more on adults who can appreciate satirical aspects than children who would most likely find the climax of the climax. (I'm middle-aged and I find it quite upset, alone.) And indeed, the prints for the English-speaking audience of the 1920s were given cover cards filled with puns and fringes to help soften the sharp stings. final. Our story takes place in a swamp, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and called a special session to find out what they can do to improve matters. They decide to ask Jupiter for the king. Crowds are extremely animated in this introductory sequence - it couldn't have been so easy for so many frog puppets to look alive at the same time - while Jupiter is portrayed as a crazy white man in the clouds who seem to prefer to slash. When Jupiter sends them a tree god who unreservedly considers them, the frogs decide it is no improvement and ask another king. Jupiter is irritated and sent by a stork. Delighted by this stunning new king standing over them, the frogs greet him with a delegation of formally dressed dignitaries. The mayor takes a step forward to give him the key to the community because the recording cameras record the event. To all the horror, the stork quickly eat the mayor and then continues with a cheerful fury and accidentally swallows the citizens. The drought cover card reads: "The news of the king spreads throughout the kingdom." Now that the frightened frogs ask Jupiter once more for help, they are losing their temper and exaggerating their community with lightning. The morale of our story, published by an unfortunate frog just before it is eaten, is "Leave yourself alone." <br /> With regard to the time when this surprising little film was created, and given that that it was made by a Russian emigrant at the height of this troubled civil war in the country, it would be easy to see it as a parable of these events. Starewicz may or may not have the Russian confusion when he did "Frogland", but anything prompted his choice of material that the film stands as a warning story about universal use. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of some era that leaves its guard down and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It is a fascinating film, even enchanting in its terrible way, but its message is not a joke.
