Despite his age, this film retains its unquestionable charm and attraction and is a great, surviving example of early British cinema. It has a basic air of oddity, scattered with a shaft of humor that is not in place, and is used to demonstrate the guaranteed direction and production value. So many episodic films are disjointed and disordered, but it's not one of them. Standard acting helps a lot, and various different characters come across as interesting and believable. All in all, this long-forgotten little gemstone is worth the attention of someone else, despite the fact that in a movie that surprisingly escaped the attention of the censor!
