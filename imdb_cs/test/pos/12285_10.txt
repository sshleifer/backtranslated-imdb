It is clear that the value of this film goes well beyond the cost that the format (mini-dv) suggests. In fact, the filmmaker adopts the format and incorporates it so crafted into the story that I forgot the fact that I didn't see a typical 35 millimeter film. This has the main attraction of independent films such as Clerks and Robert Rodriguez's work combined with fantastic "new" in the romantic comedy genre. "It's not a movie" is an honest film with sincere images and it's a great story. There is no point in this movie where I felt that the scene could be (or should be) dropped. On the contrary, the director pulls out amazing performances from truly talented actors and does so under extremely restrictive conditions. The film from page to screen is a worthy and relevant story that will hit as many levels (creative, technical, and other). I highly recommend for everyone who likes cinema or those who are looking for a little magic in an otherwise extraordinary environment.
