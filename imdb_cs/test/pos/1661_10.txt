There are not many movies that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely does. No other film of robbery approached him before or after him. The storyline is simple, but it will carry you. It never ceases to amaze me how totally grasping a movie is every time you view it. You care for all characters, even if they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and shortcomings. It's hard to imagine being a different actor besides Jean Servaise in the role of Tony le St√©phanois. When crew members talk about what they're going to do with their money and finally get to Tony, his answer and expression on his face will all say it. While the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the film (and rightly so) the film actually gets better after director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout, but instead put a big one climate score during Tony's last ride to his fate. To think that if Dassin, an American director, was not blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this masterpiece of cinema would never be as it was. Surely it wouldn't have been so good if he had been made as an American film at that time. It was absolutely terrible what Dassin had to go through, but that made him his greatest job for the benefit of all of us. I just crouch at the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake. Most of the films of indifference from Rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another. There is no reason to redo this masterpiece other than money. Leave the classics alone!
