Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: The Domination" mixes martial arts with "The Exorcist" as a horror movie. Horror elements thrown on the screen are just ridiculous, but the movie works like mindless action / flick martial arts. Fighting scenes are well choreographic and exciting, and the movie will never get bored.
