Aaah ... The thing. <br /> <br /> To see a horror movie, where not only every character over thirty, but clearly unattractive, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of the distant times when actors were chosen for their talent and their ability to play realistic Characters rather than because of their teen appeal on the magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and cameraman who can create a realistic environment rather than an overly stylized parody. And there is no striking "twist" end, or the appearance of a celebrity, or a lame pseudo-romantic subplot. And I really miss the on-set physical effects; with all those 20-year-olds trying to try crazy new ideas with blood and latex cadres and early animatronics. In 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, The American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, Nightmare on Elm Street ... what an era of horror effects! And don't let me start with the death of a dull painting. Dull work in this film is beautiful and hassle free. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? The third CGI course, former music video directors and professional stylists who also do 'brave' horror movies, look like shiny MTV videos. <br /> <br /> I'm on Netflix 'The Howling' now.
