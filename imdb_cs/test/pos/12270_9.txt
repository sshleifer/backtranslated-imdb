That was a really nice surprise. I was upstairs last night and couldn't sleep. He didn't think twice, I turned on the TV and HBO was in place, and this movie was just starting. Luckily I saw the whole thing and I am very happy to have done it. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well occupied and doing a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson performed a solid performance with a lot of stuff behind his lines. This film made me realize he's a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, as was Trey Wilson playing Colonel (this was Trey Wilson's last role before his untimely death. Too bad he was a good actor and he looked like a nice guy). Jobeth Williams also did a nice job as American wife Kristofferson. As for direction, I had no idea that Franklin J. Schaffner was a director until I read a review in the Leonard Maltin Movie Guide (that was the last movie he ever made). Now I understand why this film was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really great movie (I haven't seen his next great movie Papillon). When I watched "Welcome home", I told myself, "this director really knows what he's doing," he didn't know Schaffner was driving. There is one really beautiful scene in Thai Orphanage, enough to bring tears in my eyes. Not only was it sensitively directed, but it was directed in an economical and tense way. There is nothing unnecessary in Schaffner's efforts. The script was one of the reasons why this movie is so good. The writer does not weigh the actor with too many lines. It was written very simply but very efficiently. It just shows that you can say a lot with a few words. This film also praised me for being an American, while showing you how beautiful all people are.
