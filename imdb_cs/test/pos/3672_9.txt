My partner and I have never heard of this movie and decided to do it with the choice of a title from the cable list without knowing one thing about it. When he opened and revealed the cast, we thought how bad it could be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and others. As the story unfolded, we became more and more tickled with our choices and the movie soon made us laugh. This is not a "big" movie, but it's one of those rare movies that have such a great combination of unforgettable characters that have been gained through "truth is stranger than fiction", a surreal event that I couldn't help but love. I had no problem "suspending my mistrust" with some elements of the Wacker story, because the intentions of the filmmakers are so cordial that they still manage to joke everyone involved. As others said on IMDb, this is a movie about convenience and I wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult classic.
