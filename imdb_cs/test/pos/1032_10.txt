President Harry S. Truman once said that the only news in the world is history you don't know. Seven Years Before the Excellent Pulitzer Award by Richard Rhodes "Making the Atomic Bomb" ", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries," Oppenheimer ", it was a character study of people who designed and built a weapon that heralded the atomic age , permanently linking science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the army), not just making history, but changing the world forever. <br /> <br /> Production is perfect, casting nothing less than miraculous; not only the main characters, but also the secondary characters carry a miraculous resemblance to the people depicted. Especially Sam Waterston is in the title role of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, research director of the Manhattan Project, which was based in Los Alamos, NM, where he personally decided; Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District; David Suchet as a physicist, and the ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, almost forty years later, whispered in Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniformly consistent throughout the text. Part of a thriller, a partial love story - and finally a tragedy, this series faithfully renews the chapter in world history - and science - that we must not forget. Highest recommendations. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who like this series will also have a Jacob Bronowski 13-part "The Ascent of Man" series and Michael Frayn's "Copenhagen" BBC movie.
