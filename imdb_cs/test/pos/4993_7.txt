Anyone who wants Duvalla and Jones, come on! Viewers say things like Zahn and Urban aren't that deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That's the whole thing: they have something to learn. Zahn and Urban kick off the shallow innocence they were aiming for, and they have an excellent determination to maintain the nuances of Duvalle and Jones' entrances to the characters. Zahn is absolutely perfect as early Gus and Urban is finely perfect as the earlier Woodrow. What a bold step must be for them to be in such a place in the entertainment industry. They had to know that they should all descend on them, because in fact they are not beloved originals, but they clearly make the best efforts forward. I gave it 7 because the adjustments were torn in places and the time series were superficial, but acting was a pleasure to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. One more thing: I expect viewers to accept more of the mystique that the jaguar and blue and gold parrot shows, if more effort is made on the way they appear, and they simply accept the characters.
