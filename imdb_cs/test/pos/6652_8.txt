It's been a while since I saw Cold Mountain, I knew a little that I enjoyed it. Although it takes place during the last days of the American Civil War, it's not actually more of a war movie. and it works mainly for performances. I usually don't like Nicole Kidman, but I liked it here. I thought she was very convincing in her role. Rene Zelwegger also liked who I usually am not a fan. Jude Law is good as usual. Binding cast.there are some great supporting performances of her, too much too mentioning.This is also some breathtaking scenery in the movie. musical pieces as well. The story is sad and saddened by the tragedy, but it is a beautifully told story.
