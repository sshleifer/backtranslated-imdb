I gave it 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... good old-fashioned T&A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw it with a similar movie "Swap Meet" and both were good of their kind ... a great way to spend Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this film than one can imagine for an R-rated movie. Also, a memorable kiss (kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to have a good time in their roles (several Playboy Playmates, Danny Bonaduce, several well-known TV and movie actors, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa London's name is her surname "O'Hara" and not the 70's reputation as "Olivia" (or even Ora or She or O ... ??.). I saw it again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (pretty well endowed) and she couldn't believe I was actually enjoying the movie! Probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend Saturday afternoon ... just don't think too hard!
