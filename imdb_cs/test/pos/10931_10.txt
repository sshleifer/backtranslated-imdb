I just read what I think is an analysis of this film by a lyrical Irishman. Nice reading. However, a brief analysis of this film is that it is a blending of seven deadly sins with four types of justice. Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc., and justice in retributive, distributional, blind and divine forms. I could show three examples of each one, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it is much more fun to write to them. It's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
