I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it just set the mood and built the action. I thought this movie was very educational, taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louis Arbor and I can say that he has a big influence on me. In April 2004 Time named Louise Arbor, one of the 100 most influential people in the world. I recommend this movie to people who like historical films (of course). This film was very dramatic, but it kept telling the truth about the events in former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero, and I'm glad they made her a tribute. If you see a movie, I hope you like it.
