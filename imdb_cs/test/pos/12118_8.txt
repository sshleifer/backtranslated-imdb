I enjoyed this for several reasons. The emotional tangle was sometimes confusing and imperfectly resolved, but a mixture of intelligence records with the film's story was often persuasive. Another element I appreciated was the depiction of werewolves, fanatical Nazis, who continued to fight for formal surrender. I don't know about another movie that would deal with them. For example, Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen was murdered on Palm Sunday in 1945 and created problems for the occupation. The film then challenges the disinfected version of victory and occupation with some brave realities. "Human questions" are not presented so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that captivated those who survived Hitler - both conquered and the winner.
