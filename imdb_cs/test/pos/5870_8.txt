It is a thoughtful film that reveals the inequalities of the so-called upper class and those who work for them, ruins and the poor. Robert Shaw performs in this role as a binding, right chauffeur, with decent work, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) overcome her mental depression at the beginning. However, Steven has many mixed feelings about this high-class lady. She inevitably falls in love with her, which of course transcends the social boundaries that separate them. Before that I didn't read anything and only judged the movie as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of everyday life and the conflict of what we might want or expect from life and what we receive. It's a great drama worth seeing again.
