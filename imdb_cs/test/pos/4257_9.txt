I can't say how many times a line made me laugh or how often I described the scene to people who don't know this movie. I saw it in the year he was released, I was 19. I don't think there were about a dozen people that night. For years, I thought we were the only ones who saw it. I would like to see here that others consider it hysterical as I had, and I see that it has been a long time. Rent it, buy it or steal it.
