I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. Maybe I'll say what's coming. I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed and it wasn't a bitter laugh. it wasn't a cynical laugh. it was a laugh that was created by real joy. <br /> <br /> pleasure. this is a foreign word for me. I don't feel the word often, but I'm watching this movie. Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He's a great human being. "Smile on my face and a flash in my eyes." The line in one of Will's songs describes him perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a happy, happy boy who has Daddy as Will. Jada is a happy, happy woman who has a husband like Will. It's someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. In fact, I feel happy. It's a strange feeling. I don't feel so often. It's so nice to see, see ... other people really happy. I mean really happy. I did it in this movie. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with" gentle ", maybe I want" extraordinary ". You know, watching this movie thought me: so do I. Entertainment. Being yourself. we should be ourselves, but we feel as if we are punished if we do, maybe it has to be earned, maybe it's something we're showing after we haven't been for a long time, that's why I loved that end. Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann will all be dancing at the wedding, no restraint, NO DON'T DRUNK, except she is really happy I can at least think I can (at least I was looking forward to I saw them happy, really happy). <br /> <br /> Women and men. I know nothing about relationships, but I feel. I watch this movie and feel like connecting with someone, trying, pushing, wanting to be with It seems life ... something completely different. I guess, but I felt something and watched this movie, and I felt that this connection must be ... it must be a life worth it. That's the kind of movie. It is funny. It's CLEVER. It's TENDER. It evokes a feeling. It made me think maybe, maybe just, life is, really, a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Want LAUGH? You want to feel really good! Want to learn about GIRLS (and girls' answers about boys)? Watch Hitch. YOU-WILL-GET-IT-ALL !!! GO WILL !!! You are a great human being.
