I see that the ratings of this film for this film are not so high, so I have to be in a minority because I like the movie very much. Well, I'm right, and everyone else is bad (just kidding). I think I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and I really liked the stupid character played by Ryan. Although it is really dangerous, as well as very threatening, you cannot exactly hate it because it is clearly mentally ill and probably has some sort of brain trauma. And Wow Ryan did a really good job of showing this man! You really feel for Ida Lupino when she destroys her life. So with such intense acting and threat, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it's not exactly believable, but the boy is fun and creative. Try it and don't believe it scores 6.4 - it's much better!
