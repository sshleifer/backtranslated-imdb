I can't believe this movie has only 7.4! It certainly belongs to the best of Hitchcock's films like VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think about why the score is so low is that most of the people give up violence and will definitely not get a degree in "sex and crime". What stems from tension is not violence, it is the reckless energy of these criminals who take the child from their parents and are ready to kill the child if the operation fails. Today, when I have seen many hardboiled kidnapping movies like Mel Gibson's RANSOM, it seems normal, but in the fifties, when the family was whole in contemporary America, the idea of ​​such a crime certainly aroused a lot of emotion. And this tension is still working for me today. Yeah, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, worrying about how they act: It's an agreement for them and they want to be "good traders", no matter what the store kidnapped the kids and murdered the politicians in the opera !! But what makes the film great is the creative aspects, the idiosyncratic thoughts of Hitchcock, the blatantly disturbing scene in the church (which brings it to the attention of the viewer, how alone they left the protagonists), no one cares, no one helps, people in the church just go home ...), meet the owner of this store, stuff and prepare dead animals (which underlines the somewhat "oriental" atmosphere the film has from the opening scenes abroad), not least the role of MUSIC in this movie. Music is a key principle here, since *** SPOILER *** assassination of targeted politics needs to be done at this very moment of loud orchestra tutti / gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera watch the orchestral score and now it happens in the second *** BANG *** And then, of course, DORIS DEN sings Que sera, which became more famous than the film itself; She sings it to announce his parent's baby being on the embassy ... <br /> <br /> Everyone in All: Classic!
