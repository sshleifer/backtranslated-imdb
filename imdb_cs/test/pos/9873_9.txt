This movie is pretty good as it is, but the unreleased Producer's Cut is my favorite film in the series after the original. Jamie's story is processed differently, death scenes are done 10 times better, there are more ritual-type shots that give more story about Micheal, Jamie and her child. There is also an alternative ending that is also better. Why didn't they release this version instead, I have no idea. If you find this version, read it.
