I just saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was my favorite festival. A gymnast is a film that SHOULD NOT be missed. It's an honest story about relationships, self-learning, aging and the courage to change and move forward. Not only is it a good story, but the famous aerialist performance Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take you away! Check out this movie! He will be at the festival soon. This film deserves to be picked up immediately by the main network or studio. I'm sure I'll buy it when it's available on DVD.
