It's not bad MOW. I was expecting another film based on women's questions, but I was pleasantly surprised by the tension element. Sure, parts of the plot were pretty hokey, but for the most part the movie quarreled. Was the matrix associated with a former husband, someone in the pub, or was it the man (man) who cut off? Daniel Magder was excellent. I saw him in Strike's mom and in the Guilt by Association, both MOW and he are very nice, especially the way he challenges his mother the way a preteen would behave. Laura Leighton also played a typical mother (ex-wife) who can be covered by both men and women. She was frustrated enough to seem real. <br /> <br /> See if you've missed it. It's worth it.
