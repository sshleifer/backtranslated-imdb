OK, first to all who hate: Get Life! I don't see why you're bothering on these records when you know you don't know anything about film, robots, or people. This film has all the important information for us to learn about sex, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINA. We are indeed all robots, programmed to respond to certain paths to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen the sunset and made some comments without thinking about it? I say thank you Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) for stopping me and thinking about the amazing power of Mother Nature. It is only when Val and Aqua reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire to find love and flee the factory in search of creative life. This film should be viewed in prisons - just imagine dreams and hopes that could inspire prisoners. perhaps they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a crime-free world. We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person for Heartbeeps.
