Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of Western spaghetti during the 1960s and early 1970s; usually he was cast in secondary parts as ugly villains. Kooky Klaus lands himself with a succulent starring role as crazy Johnny Laster, a foul, sneaky and disheveled sex maniac who comes up with a plan to kidnap a beautiful heiress to earn her considerable inheritance. Johnny and his gang are becoming wanted refugees after the plan becomes disastrous. Writer / director Mario Costa is a cleverly captivating portrait of a seriously ill and twisted piece of low-life torture: the story is developing at a steady pace, the tone is reasonably bold and serious, and exciting action scenes are staged with real scenes. skills and brio (shooting in rock quarries are particularly breathtaking and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, leaking oily charisma from every rotten pore and jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets, Kinski Johnny makes for a fascinating scary and monstrous brutal. Kinski is simply spectacular because of this brilliantly repellent character; He receives subtle support from the kind Gabriella Giorgelli as a sweet, fire-saloon girl Juanita, Steven Tedd as a cheerful Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as a reckless leader of the gang group of Machete, Giuliano Raffaella as a clever lawyer Gary Pinkerton, and Paolo Casella as Johnny's reasonable parter Glen. Kudos are also fine for Stelvio Cipriani's whimsical and temperamental score. Worth seeing for Kinski fans.
