Many IMDB patrons seem to have come across this little movie when it appeared in the Canadian Showcase Network. I was, like many of you, also sucked in and watched the whole movie. At first I was dependent on a literal dialogue and a moral sense of humor with which the film is rich. I was running around comfortably on a wave "Kevin Smith meets Killer Films" until the middle when the movie really broke up and explored his motives in more detail ... with a definitely darker and sharper edge. Far from being excluded from this experience, I was brought on. This is not the best film of this kind and will certainly not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought it and enjoyed it immensely. The "flash back" movement in chronology was effective, the characters were well implemented, and the questions raised were human, available (in my experience as well) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to stay sweet, fun, and entertaining without avoiding the controversial theme and raw emotional language, dynamics, and situations. This film is a great antidote to a lot of schlock that has penetrated a witty / clever romantic genre. Some male Brigitte Jones for literal sect. Take 2 hours of your busy schedule and jump into the Wirey world ... or you could go rent out "You have the mail" because if you appeal to it, you don't like it anyway! Those of us who did it will be fine without you on our side ...
