One of the most famous movie series! Still interesting today, though it has an "old movie" look at it. The second series looks better, but simply does not match. Actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great editing by the Universal Expert team. The music score was tracked from Universal's 'Destination Unknown', 'Invisible Man', 'Black Cat' and 'Werewolf from London'. And what a great action music! If there is a choice for the best time series, it should be (probably) number 1.
