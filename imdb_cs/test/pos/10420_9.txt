Director Ramin Niami delivers goods somewhere in the city. I believe this cheerful farce is in the tradition of Mel Brooks comedy. Niami tries to have fun in New York City by creating credible, eccentric and tragic characters from a tenement apartment building that brings them to life from the very beginning of the one that represents them. The performance of Peter Stormare as a gay Shakespeare actor is totally appreciated and the film generally does a good job of pointing to the hopelessness and laughter of self-confident ambition. Sandra Bernhard is perfectly cast as a straight, confident therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance, especially since I haven't been a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete the international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiotic criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives mattered. With a portrait of Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance of Paul Anthony Stewart, a revolutionary mom's boy, he'll have some fun in the city without losing his rhythm.
