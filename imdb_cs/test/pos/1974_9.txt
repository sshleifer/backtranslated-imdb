Yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think it's a good sign for the movie, though some are negative. I've seen this movie 2 and a half times. I adore it and will watch it again. it's very clever, but I understand why some people hate it. they have no appeal. Yes, I have weird taste in movies, but this is a great movie. Some lines are as fast as the whole scene in a Chinese restaurant. I started dying. and when he was on the assembly line, he talked to the contact. Judaic law was amazing, though it was funny, trying to cover up his amazing accent. anyway, i don't consider myself a movie goddess like some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to write pseudo-intellectual movie comments about movies you hate online, I'm sorry Why don't you write about movies you like, like me. I just love how everything connects, keeps you guessing, even if you guess wrong. the end was interesting and not exaggerated. it was purely clever. I would compare it with a nut because I think people will get a bad idea. I went to this movie and waited nothing but jude law and science fiction. I was blown away. I have no idea about other cronenburg movies, but I love it for my own merits. another smart thing was a harbinger with the dog. definitely watch this movie.
