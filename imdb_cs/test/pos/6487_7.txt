Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are concerned that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) live in Greenwich Village with their uncle John (Milland) Czech lifestyle . after the death of his parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon gave up trying to convince John to allow Susan to take care of the children and resort to using private detectives to catch him either in unpleasant behavior or unemployed, so they couldn't take care of the kids properly. Finally, Susan decides to take things into her own hands and herself goes to Greenwich Village, where she acts as an actress to try to get information and / or convince him to see the reason. But what she finds is that she likes not only the free and artistic lifestyle that John and his friends live and that the girls are raised well, but that she has fallen in love with John quickly. Her true identity is inevitably revealed, and she is confronted with the challenge of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong to whom. I really enjoyed this movie and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to make this simple but cute story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the greatest actresses of the 1940s, is pleased in this film. Its energy, style and healthy beauty are truly suited to creating a cute character, even if you know that it attracts people with whom it quickly becomes fast. This is the oldest movie I saw Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patrician. (And apparently three years younger than his star) His energy and carefree way in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change in the behavior he affects in his usual darker films. Frankly, although I am usually not a fan of children's actors, I really liked two young girls who played niece Susan. They were very excited and were really the gems of the film. Unfortunately, I can't dig any other movies that would then appear after one of them, which is a shame because they both exhibited a great deal of natural talent. "The Wise Girl" was a movie that was made three years after the Hollywood code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and pie in heaven of grandeur and lightness with which characters they lived. In fact, the alleged Czech association was a beautiful dead end where artists lived freely or for the sake of trade and everything was very nicely tied. Fortunately, it was such a light film and the characters were charming enough to contribute to his inhalation and short arrivals and I was able to take "Wise Girl" for what it was; A good old fashioned love story that was as fun as it was cute. Unfortunately, the movies of today's romantic comedy / dramatic genre are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or I would keep coming back to the class. 7/10
