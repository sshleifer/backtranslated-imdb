Being a freshman in college, this movie reminded me of my relationship with mom. Of course, my situation is not parallel to the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon; But Mom and I grew up with a typical mother and daughter fighting. There is always a mother saying what to do or not to be the kind of mother you want to be. At the end of this movie, I was watching my eyes. The reaction of her daughter on the East Coast, miles away, after all they had, reminded me of how I felt when I was from a small town on the West Coast to New York. The film is for women who have children who have now grown up. It is very moving, the film moved me. Every character feeling in this movie was absolutely real, you didn't get any false sentiment. I sat alone through the credits to screen this movie, I wish my mother would sit beside me to hug her and thank her for everything. Of course, this movie is a bit frantic, but it's all really important. It is what mum can learn from her child; and what the child learns from his mother. 8/10
