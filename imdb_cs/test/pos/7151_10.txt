I saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it didn't bring more attention because it was not only powerful and beautifully created but very original. The audience was totally committed and the biggest part of this film at the festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and then participate in the Q&A session. They literally had to throw us out of the screening room for another movie - we could have gone much longer. The film is both provocative and cheerful. It will be a shame if this movie is not picked up for wider distribution - I hope it will be at least available on DVD because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
