Visconti's "Death in Venice", which mainly takes place in Venice, is a triumph of filmmaking that combines the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterization with the resort's professional photography in all its daily moods. For those who love Venice, it's a movie that they have to respect. Mahler's music has often heard throughout the film and raises drama. The mood he creates is not always happy. But what else would you expect with such a title? There are not many dialogues in the movie. In fact, it is rather sparse. It is mainly the sound of the background and the trembling and laughter among the hotel guests. An interesting part is the interpretation of the exchange of views between Gustav von Aschenbach, the composer of some renown and slim youthful youth Tadzio, who from time to time look at the tables of the hotel dining room, the beach and the unpredictable places. around Venice. They seem to recognize each other's shy presence initially with a little more than a smile suggestion, but later with a strong and impressive look. <br /> <br /> Each viewer will have their own interpretation. The composer lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of the desire for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction to this fragile young man with his dazed, somewhat gorgeous look? Could he discover some new inspiration for the still unwritten musical masterpiece? Who knows? From the beginning to the end, this film captures the true spirit of Venice in the 19th century. Ladies' elegance, sun loungers, children spreading their throats to their knees, swimsuits, glare of sunsets and a general sense of satisfaction with the world. While some may think that the pace is sometimes quite slow, the film is generally subtle in quality, but with a warm indecision between two repressed people. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.
