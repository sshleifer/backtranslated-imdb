Will Smith be perfect as a "Relationship Doctor" to heal all your relationships here. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a standard RomCom with a little fun. I'm glad to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is kind and unexpectedly "fresh" in this Andy Tennant. Surrounded by great support, an interesting story and a lively witty dialogue, I was thoroughly employed. We found one cute, unpredictable and inspiring one without preaching. <br /> <br /> Rated 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
