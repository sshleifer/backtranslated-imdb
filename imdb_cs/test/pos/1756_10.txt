Hi again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story about how to be one another, kindness and love. You will forget that these are related errors. It was as if they were people. I love this movie as well as my adult children. Such beautiful colors in this movie. I need to see this movie again. There is a story about the cover in the movie that I just can't remember "why" it. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
