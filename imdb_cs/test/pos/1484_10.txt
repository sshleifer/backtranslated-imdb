This is one of my favorite T.V shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is simply a genius!, And it's just a montage that I chose it to be my 1000 review!. I can't tell you how much I love Mr. Bean, he's a man, and what amazes me is how he gets out of these incredibly difficult situations and is always so creative, and Robyn Driscoll also deserves credit! . My favorite piece he did is Amazing Adventures of Mr. Bean and while all the others are amazing, it will remain my favorite plus I wish the show didn't stop so soon! Each episode is brilliantly written and all masterfully controlled, and every episode is classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and I can definitely see why because it's perhaps the funniest show ever. All the actors played really well here, especially Robyn Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (as Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time Rowan Atkinso is just giving a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (maybe the best!), And it's just a montage that I chose to make it my 1000 reviews What you are doing right now and go look at it, you will not regret believing that it is one of the best TV shows ever!, and I will continue to watch the show over and over again, I never tire it! Mr. Bean's rules! ***** of 5
