For the first time I saw it in syndicated television in the 1970s and admired its production values, which were high technology at the time. The reconstructed video is rich and colorful, far more intense than the pale 35mm TV prints. This film deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFOs, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with detailed miniatures and cleverly designed aids. The story of the alternative planet Earth is recycled hundreds of times from Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its confident European design spirit: from Rolls Royce to Euro Sec. Letterhead business paper, JFSS or Dopplegangers, as it was called in Europe, is pleasing to the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the great powers. The ambitious epic of Gerry and Sylvie Anderson is a bit boring when the American astronaut finally realizes he is on Earth's doppleganger, and everything is literally downhill after a poetically tuned shuttle. The average story is aided along with a large and lyrical classic score by the late Big Barry Gray, John Williams of Britain.
