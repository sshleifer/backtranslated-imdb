I saw this movie in the early 1990s when it was on VHS for a while. At that time, I found it interesting, and was particularly hit by the Ken Russell segment, with the vision of the accident victim in sorting and surgery. Last night, during the second run from the last Indiana Jones movie, John Hurt's vision, it sparked an unexpected memory of "Arii" that I hadn't thought of in years, and the sudden memory of Russell himself was enough to cause tears to erupt. bit. If I can do this observation, I note with interest the love and hate reaction people have expressed to the Russell segment, and I found this interesting difference in other films that delve into deep trauma. and its consequences. Some of it GET, others NE, interesting. <br /> <br /> According to comments and ratings, I can see that overall work has hit people in different ways. It affected and influenced me.
