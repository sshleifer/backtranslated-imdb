For those who still prefer human-centered films, Birch Street needs to be seen. It explores the common but often unspoken dynamics of the family, without resorting to exaggeration or sensation. In fact, the film is a deceptively low key at the beginning. Besides looking at one family - and, of course, each family - the block also recorded a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if it was intentional but inevitable because of the contents of the archive. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
