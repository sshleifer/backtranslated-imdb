"Hollywood Cavalry" is a slightly amusing 1939 movie starring two 20th century staples Fox List, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a couple in jokes. Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings the actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a great silent comedy that eventually turns her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he is utterly shocked when she and her leading man (Alan Curtis) run and get married. He's so shocked he'll be fired. She and her husband are leaving and are becoming more popular, while Connors' studio is starting to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, it will pass. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to direct his next film. There's a lot of Keystone Kick shots, which is pretty funny, and some fantastic Buster Keaton grotesque that's amazing. The film also has a scene from "jazz singer" when interviews take over. In-joke, of course, has to do with Rin Tin-Tin, for which Zanuck wrote. In one scene, Rinny's coach brings him as a potential contract player to Connors studio. Connors throws both out of the office. Several scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin is shown to be the # 1 box office. The role of the famous German Shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr., a dad who died in the arms of Jean Harlow in 1932, one month of shy 14th birthday. Fortune smiled at him at the end. Alice Faye is very nice and does a great job, just like Ameche, who is turning to power. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide very good support. Unfortunately, this movie is not entirely sure what it is - history, comedy, romance, or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite observable.
