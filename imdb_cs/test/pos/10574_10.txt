It's always hard to bring a book of 450 pages up to three hours. I read the book before, and I found BBC production dealing with this problem in the best possible way. The quality of the book has not been lost: the dense and vivid depiction of the patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of various social groups in different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film does viewers look different in the same scenes when told first from Sue's perspective, then from Maud's view. The main actors do very well, and in particular the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with the first climax in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil that they are ready to do and mutually mutually because they still love each other. For each of her books, Sarah Waters thoroughly explored what life was in the British 19th century. While in Tilting Velvet it was the world of theaters vaudeville and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the horrific reality of women believers and fashion ghost evocations, in Fingersmith she depicts a public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons presumed or declared disrupted by institutions sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vibrant emotions and tension.
