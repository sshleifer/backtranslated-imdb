This show is absolutely fantastic. It provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like OC and Dawsons, but it's a lot more fun. It is a show with morality and values, without anything that is sugar coated and disinfected (ala 7th Heaven). In Australia we have neither sorority nor fraternity, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how exactly Greek life is. displayed. But I don't care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can love me as a racist, homophobic Confederate flag must be a genius. And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry Josh Jackson, you were arrested!
