This movie is the biggest ninja movie ever made in my opinion, and if you haven't seen it, it's worth watching. This movie I would rate 10/10 if you want to see more and then check out http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence, where the evil ninja kills everyone who is in the way is excellent, his character is the best. Then he must have a woman who dies him. Then they must take revenge on the cops who killed him, which means there is more killing and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her friend, who is also one of her goals, get help from Yamad (Sho Kosugi) to release the evil ninja spirit and destroy it.
