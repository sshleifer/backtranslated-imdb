I went to see ITALIAN WORK with mixed reviews in my head. I was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment close to 2 hours. I thought the cast was just great, as were the special effects, with safety and a truck that fell out of sight. If you like action movies at a fast pace, it's the one you see.
