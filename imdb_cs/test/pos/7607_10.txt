I love this movie. it focuses on both questions: reality and imagination. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that favorite guy, Billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, have we? be honest! Another real problem is because of the pain people get from teasing. and whoa, high school life. Remember it? Fantasy is to find your true love when you are 25 years old and you are in high school. not really fancy, but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was amazing. Drew Barrymore did a wonderful job, just like the cheerful David Arquette. the people who worked in the movie are amazing. Did I never repeat it? Never Was Kissing is one of the movies that should follow later generations. It shows reality and some no-problems for people like you and me.
