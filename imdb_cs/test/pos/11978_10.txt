All the people who voted in this movie for skinny 1 is all I have to say: You didn't have enough to enjoy a movie of this kind. Achieving this level of recognition requires some effort. And this is the segment of the people that this film was focused on. You are not average movie visitors by chance! . Back to the movie. This one was a gem of fine and certainly included in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I would like to give him all time series no. 2, surpassed only by the legendary Gundou Kanti Shah. This film had a perfect story and created a wonderful blend of fantasy and science fiction. In fact, Pan's labyrinth would be ashamed of the balance between parallel stories. And now I really have to mention the star cast and even the star er (that is the word from NOW) showing them (special mention is made to Mr. Nigam for the best debut ever in every movie on this country). Every actor in this film has been very carefully selected and the role has been adapted for them (and I also have to add for their age). Manisha Koirala still seems to be 18 and wow, with this character I would also rap her. Are you wondering where the rape thing suddenly appeared? Yes, rape is what the space of this film is based on. And that's not like your average Bollywood movie. If you happen to be an atheist or an agnostic, this film is a must for you again. Because this movie can heal your faith. I don't think it too far to say that this film can cure cancer. Only the people who need it do not appreciate their power, magic and undying beauty. Oh, so unhappy! Only the bug in this movie: In your dreams, baby! That was flawless. Only a minor complainant: The director could not play Mithuna Da anyway. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin it. Go and watch it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some other recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, Old Ramsay Brothers Horror Movies, Loha, Indra Tiger and Sivaji.
