I'm not sure what version of the movie I saw, but it was very fun. I didn't know who the "Twins" (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) were before I saw this movie and I think the English name is a bit misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I especially liked it because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was shot very nicely. Donnie Yen (see him in Hero, great performance) as a director is great because he knows how to shoot these scenes. Everything seemed to me, except for one scene where the girls are. roof fight with bamboo sticks. It really has nothing to do with the chart, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the better (modern) HK action moves I have seen in a while. Though in some ways cheesy, it still pulls him. Definitely 9/10
