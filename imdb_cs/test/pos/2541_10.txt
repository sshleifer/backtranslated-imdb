The three things you can say about Spalding Gray are: definitely marching to the rhythm of your own "drummer"; never been lost by words; and apparently he felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in all aspects of his life, experiences, and thoughts - no matter how occasionally they were trivial. Most of us are not as far away from the wall as they were. Most of us don't care to share most of the minutes with others, whether it's someone else or in small groups, let alone on stage. Less interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, unusual man. And after seeing one of his performances, on reflection, we can find that many of his articular musings may have been more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we might have thought for the first time. New York / avant-garde personality type and undeniably a little "strange." I give him "10" for the talent he represents in this genre, which is his specialty.
