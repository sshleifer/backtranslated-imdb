Even with all the cinemas dealing with the Vietnam War trauma (Jacob's Ladder, Deer Hunter, Apocalypse, and Taxi Driver to some extent), you don't even know what half happened. Even contemplation of horror feels inhuman. And the procedure - or retreat? - to the inhumanity it requires is a key part of the Apocalypse, Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, "The Heart of Darkness", which records the loss of common sense and corruption of morality, which comes at a distance from civilization - the surface of the bestial nature, as it was, the Lord of the Flies and psychological trips to Vietnam. The story is Willard, a general commissioned by a special mission to Cambodia after his first trip to service in Vietnam is served. Willard was stuck in Saigon at the beginning of the movie, psychologically incapable of returning home - an eerie echo of Nicky in a deer hunter. So he is contacted: his job is to assassinate a Green Beret apostate who has isolated himself at a remote base on the Nung River, and who has reportedly disappeared completely mad - venerated as a god and killing indiscriminately. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role in his career (best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard travels up the army boat with some escort soldiers, his testimony of horror and madness - and the immense absurdity of it all - leads to a frightening sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they meet. In fact, by the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't seem to be as bad as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or extraordinary. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality, a base at the end of the world. Loss of civilization, loss of judgment, self. Kurtz's monologue of the atrocity he witnessed as the Green Beret, and his later revelation, is one of the most frosty and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, the human spirit and its break - here's a lot like a deer hunter and just as well. However, the apocalypse goes beyond what we can endure at a global level - Coppola's vast shots from the damp, murky jungles of Cambodia and the initial sequence of helicopters amidst exploding forests and orange skies - set on the oddly tuned Doors soundtrack - as well as the chilly scenes on the river a Wagner-blasting village speaker (a scene that has become one of the most frosty, dark-witty and strikingly absurd war scenes of all time) - all that makes sense for the apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, but the Apocalypse now and forever. The deer hunter is much more up close and personal, you can even say by name, and shows the overall effect of the trauma he has on the individual psyche, the breakup of the human soul, and his ability to either surrender completely to the forces of darkness, or limp on. Therefore, both films are the same - they are two parts of the same thing. In "The Heart of Darkness", Kurtz is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz left all the conflicts behind him. He is beyond good and evil. He let go of morale, as if a drowned man is going to rescue his hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz is really just waiting for death, citing T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words and words that were reflected at the end of the film are: "Horror ... horror." It refers to the infinite emptiness of existence, to the human psyche and the black emptiness of the playground in its own mind, where atrocities are reborn. It is impossible to express, in words, the experience one watches by watching this film - in short, the experience Willard is experiencing on his journey. The final part, at the base, almost actually comparable to her brother's deer scene, is one of the deepest, calm and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen.
