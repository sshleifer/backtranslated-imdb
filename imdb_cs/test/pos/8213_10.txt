Eventually!! Sandra Bullock is a really beautiful woman, but I finally found a movie she gets for an actress! Forget the predictable food Keanu with SPEED, forget the predictable food Kleenex where you were SAVING - it tests! <br /> <br /> And it's great! A techno-feminist role that really works well on the screen, on a theme that's very close to the bone. The problems raised do not seem too attractive and the whole experience, which has helped us with the great accompaniment, is unpleasant for a few hours. You must never enter another chat -room again, in fact I am pretty nervous just writing this review ... er ... bye!
