Although this film looks like a criminal thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and has very few surprising twists or turns - and those that appear are not exactly shocking. But if you slip out of "intense action thriller" and into "mindless fun," it's a really fun movie with a few funny moments. Most of them can be attributed to the witty dialogue between Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson - but that said, Sadie said it in her cheerful opening greeting to Friedman and left very little else to develop something else between the two. I did not consider these esteemed versions of the British South accents actors to be bad (Ok, Thompson sounded like balls were rolling in her mouth as she tried to speak south, but Rickman was surprisingly good enough, with very small minor blackouts in his usual English accent - if you want to criticize the accents - discuss it Coco - just spoke in the south! <br /> <br />
