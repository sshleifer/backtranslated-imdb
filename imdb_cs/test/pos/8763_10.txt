It's hard to put the devastating beauty of Traffik on words, partly because I still understand to understand it myself, a few hours after my second observation. First of all, Traffik contains some of the incomparably most unpleasant and unpleasant scenes I have seen in film or television production. Acting is excellent, especially Bill Paterson as a British minister struggling with his heroin addict and help with Pakistan, which depends on drug issues. Another plot describes these drug-related problems at the ground level in Pakistan and revolves around the fighting opium poppy poppy and its interaction with the successful heroin smuggler. The third major plot involves the prosecution of a drug importer in Hamburg and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two German detectives when he is in the process. It is a profound success that the interaction between these stories feels natural, beyond the forced confusion of conspiracy often found in Hollywood movies. It is even more successful that work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and fascinating without being overly simplified. It's devastating - bleak and brutal, but never hostile. In short, Traffik is a rare piece of film that handles challenging items with unmatched compassion and clarity.
