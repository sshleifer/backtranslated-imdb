Some critics compared the Chop shop with the theatrical releases of God City and Pixote. I've seen both of them, just like the Chop Shop, and as in many cases I don't feel like it was a comparison. The city of God and Pixote certainly had a much higher budget. The Chop Shop is a low-budget, independent film about survival and hope, disappointment and continuation of life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open, and either the filmmakers had incredible connections, or they shot the scene at a different time, and US open footage was added. I say that because I live in an area where the film was filmed and security is crazy while tennis matches are taking place. It is also noteworthy that the actors' real names were the names of their characters in the film. Back to the movie. It's a pleasant survival story. However, it ended up getting 7 because ... sometimes the actors acted very well. At other times, they seemed to be reciting their lines. If the actors were less competent (for example, in the low budget "The Big Dis"), I would be more forgiving. In several scenes, however, each of these actors gave an exemplary performance. At other times, he seemed bored. The director might be to blame. I also had problems with the end. This is one of those films that "ends". Maybe part 2 will be there? Definitely worth getting on DVD. I wont bother to summarize the story because this information is already available on IMDb.
