A film that deserves a theatrical release. This film made for television is a movie gem that illustrates Michael Mann's technique with a constant blend of contemporary music with visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, the intensification of the influence of music is almost the same as if there was an invisible actor in the academy who was added to the ensemble of actors, writers, directors and cameramen. This movie is definitely one of my favorite favorites. While nothing is perfect, this movie comes very, very close. Along with an excellent script, great lead and masterful performance by Richard Strauss, in their most beautiful performance is a set of star actors: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize names, but you will recognize all faces. <br /> <br /> If it happens on TV, sit with popcorn, turn on the sound for amazing soundtrack and score and get ready for riveting. 97 minutes of film. I highly recommend recording because it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and DVD is encoded by Region 2.
