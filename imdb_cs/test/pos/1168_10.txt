As a rule, we think the British are experts in plotting a great imperial adventure, similar to The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial Age was mostly British. Here, in the wind and in the lion, we see a beautiful representation of the American's own imperial age. The American power projection under Teddy Roosevelt is the basis of this conventional story of a kidnapped Miss, who, despite gentleness, is defeated by the harsh, manly nobility of her captor, who is again disarmed by her beauty and contempt. (Politically correct prigs desire to see any mild "native" peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves in the contemporary world scene.) What makes this story different from amazing production values ​​- flawless photos, composition and cut - amazing casting - underestimated by Brian Keith, who plays Teddy's tyrant - and lively history. Through his son's eyes, each family member can identify with one of the characters, be it the noble brigand Sean Connery, the wild heroine Candace Bergen, the kind John Huston John John, or the sleepy, radiant, reckless Lieutenant Steve Kanaly. , Roosevelt's "Big Stick." There is a transcendent scene at the end when a little boy is symbolically swept by the lively Moor on his white steed. This is the best adventure.
