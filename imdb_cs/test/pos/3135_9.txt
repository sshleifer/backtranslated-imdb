One of my favorite westerns and one of the best John Ford's in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shone in most of everything that appears, and here he gets precious lead as the title character. Corresponding to him is Ward Bond as the crunching Mormon Elder leading his people to the West. John Ford's composition of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as well as scary silent James Arness, a clan member of outlaw Clegg who joins the train wagon. The Mormon Trail to Utah was one of the most challenging and challenging businesses ever made. We cannot feel it, but we see the suffering that had to be overcome by the pioneers on the way to the west; river crossings, long stretches of dry, waterless deserts, encounters with Indians, and so on, all went on the famous song of the pioneers' sons. Mormons actually made bits of trail with selections and shovels, as depicted in the film. My main regret is that it wasn't done in color, but I believe there is a color version. By the way, those rocky rock formations in different scenes are called Fisher Towers, near Moab. Very recommended viewing.
