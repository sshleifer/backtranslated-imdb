How often do you see a movie of any kind that has a talent show with a snack? Waldo's last stand is a snack. Here Waldo sells lemonade, but doesn't make any money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat came to visit him, which is ironic because in both the 3 Men in the Bath and they came on their backs where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for Darly's love. Back to the story: Gang tasting lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. One funny moment is when Alfalfa gets a glass of lemonade and Waldo fills it and gives it to Darla and Alfalfa has an angry look on her face. Spanky suggests a floor show to go with lemonade, and even Mickey agrees to be so cute. When the show starts on the floor, no one is in the barn, but then the customer (Froggy) comes. Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade, but all he does is nod. Spanky asks him how many times in a short and every time Froggy nods, not Spanky's face shows many expressions that are funny. Spanky tries many ways to thirst him. One way is when he always said Mickey so sharply "The biscuits are salty and they thirsty me". There are also many fun musical pieces. The opening number is Darla, who tries to dance and sing. The second includes Alfalfa singing off-key (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat about "How Dry I Am!" (I believe they sing it to make Froggy thirsty. The closing number includes the boys and girls who are dressed in the old way. This was Waldo's last Gang short.
