After a disaster in New York's Grand Central Station, he is an innocent observer (Kevin Spacey, "Usual Suspects") arrested by police who believe he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why he thinks that, considering how a man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really clear." So Prot (as she identifies herself as a "goat" rhyming) is shipped to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where Mark Powell, a tired workaholic (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski"), attempts to understand this man's fallacy. Prot's way is polite and cooperative. When asked why she thinks she was institutionalized, she answers the fact that it's because "you think I'm crazy". Within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable starving hunger for Earth fruit, open to Prot revealed that he is an alien from K-PAX, which is 1,000 light-years away, circling around the binary star system Agape and the Satori located in the constellation Lyra. The details also describe how his infinitely advanced species have already mastered traveling faster than light, through the use of the light energy that is allegedly gone for the human race. Of course, Powell is very skeptical about these outrageous claims, even if they are fascinated by them, and commits to understand how Prot believed such things. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his fellow citizens in the psychiatric ward and eventually offers everyone around him something to live and hope for healing. On July 27, Prot later reveals that he will retire again for K-PAX, and he can only take one person with him. What actually happens that day, no one is sure. Originally criticized to play Dr. Powell ?? Will Smith as Prot? Kevin Spacey entered the lead role when Smith had to withdraw from the film. You can say that he had a lot of fun with his character, often making his laughter conversation sometimes ("Your production was a trip in itself") often made a real laugh. For many words, Proto is an undeniable intelligence, but logic claims to be vicious ... mustn't it? Viewers are led back and forth between options? For the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (that's a sci-fi movie, right?!) than it is absolutely convinced when Prot inexplicably depicts the impossible astronomy knowledge of the newly discovered planetary system. Dr. Powell offers us a neatly packed earthly explanation for Prot's delusions, but that's as fast as we left off, and we scratched our heads again. The film, quite rightly, keeps its end open, so viewers can contemplate what they've been watching and discuss it with those who surround them. Whether you think Prot is an extraterrestrial, two irresistible certainties persist in your mind: the universe is a truly fascinating place, and perhaps there are higher powers that we humans have not yet discovered.
