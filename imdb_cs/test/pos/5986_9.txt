I wouldn't compare it to Le Placard, who had IMHO more comic moments, but Romuald & Juliette, while he was a slow starter, certainly retained your attention throughout the movie, walked nicely and reached the curtain that warmed the heart :) There were many amazing comedic moments, brilliant pathos and the realistic situation of all actors. It was a typical French film in which, when confronted with prejudices and phobias that the viewer confronted with his own shortcomings! I'm definitely glad to have it in my library, and I'll no doubt be watching it again and again, which is a sign of a big movie for me.
