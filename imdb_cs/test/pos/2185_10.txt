George Hearn really went out and over the top, which in this case was great. I heard the version of Len Cariou, but it was too tame. George was great in this character - very expressive. Angela Lansbury was perfect for the game. She gave great performance. She gave Mrs. Lovett a great sneaky and comical personality that matched the dark story. I like dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and angry emotions George Hearn in her songs of anger, revenge and anxiety. I've been watching this game 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS. I bought it on video (after copying it in 1985 myself) when it came out in 1990 and I bought a copy of the DVD when it was released in 2004.
