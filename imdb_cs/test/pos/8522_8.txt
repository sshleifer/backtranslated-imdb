You don't rate James Bond movies, evaluate them, rate them as they meet expectations. There are certain things to expect, even the demand for Bond and any individual effort either adds or not. Here are ten elements that make the Bond film Bond film. And though NEVER NEVER MEETS, not technically part of Bond's official filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery, returning as 007, makes him more than an honorary member of the series. Here's how to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER NEVER NOTES: A clever name has no obvious link to a real story, but it's a reference to Sean Connery's promise to never play OO7 again after being lured back for DIAMONDS they are FOREVER. Whatever it is, it's a catchy name. 8 points. Pre-Credit Teaser: Maybe you're trying to avoid all the obvious parallels with the official EON series of Bond movies, there's no Teaser; the introductory scenes are currently displayed for credits. And even that is disappointing: another "oh-no, Bond was killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Initial Credits: In addition to the tiny 007 screen, they didn't even bother trying to ignite credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points. Song Theme: As Michel LeGrand wrote and sang Lani Hall "Never Say Never" would be a perfect part of a particularly long lift ride. As a Bond theme, it's just fine. 6 points. "Bond, James Bond": Reasonably, because this film sees Connery luring back into service as Bond for decades hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question of whether Bond / Connery is still on the job. Fortunately, Connery was more prepared than Bondage again. Although a little grayer, with a slightly larger perimeter and wearing somewhat more obvious blunt eyes, it seems to have no difficulty sliding back into action. All in all, it's one of the best and most comfortable Connery characters. 9 points. Bond Babes: Even in the best of Bond movies, female characters don't have a big dimension; they exist predominantly as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar winner Kim Basinger has gained a lot of space in creating his character Domino Petachi and the film goes on. He's doing a great job - and there's no way to look at it. 8 points. Bond Villain: Reports of his death are clearly exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for the moment - showing that he has more lives than his prized pussy. One-time Jesus portrayed a stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow has little to do in this role, but yet it is a silky presence. But he is overshadowed by the wonderful performance of Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal villains, Bond is so refreshing for Brandauer that he has shown a performance that is both subtle and colorful. Funny, without being camped, reckless without seeming to be cartoon; his Largo position there up with Auric Goldfinger as one of the best Bond villains. 10 points. Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? Barbara Carrera, who played with all the brave styles of an extremely spectacular lady, plunges into the film and depicts a mixture of self-service evil and more than just pure psychotic insanity. Bond crossed the paths with a variety of females fatales, most of whom were so easily liquidated that they existed more as a fun eye candy than as characters. Few, however, dared to show such an outburst for dramatic or such wild determination. Even her premature demise is magnificent, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. Sinister Plot: As a remake of THUNDERBALLs, the film seems to have been a bit finished - that: nuclear missiles are stolen and big real estate will go if all countries in the world pay no more than half a million dollars. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to be forced to remake one of Bond's weakest adventures. By comparison, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds alone. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production Values: The film begins with a restless style, such as a TV movie that tries to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film gains momentum and sense of meaning, making it an excellent adventure. 8 points. Bonus Points: There are several special changes that make this Bond movie different from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is barely recognized; as played by Edward Fox, "M" is an eccentric old grouch with no respect to "Double Os," predicting how Judi Dench would later play a role; and "Q" suddenly has a rooster accent and is a buddy with Bond. And there is a special curiosity of nostalgia in the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with vintage Packard and the tango dance number that is cleverly embedded in the story. And the big rescue at the end is on horseback, a tribute to the RAIDERS OF THE GOLDEN ARK, which was itself a tribute to Bond's films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER use a mixed bag. In really important areas, it's more than just the hero of Connery, the villain Brandauer, the murderer Carrer and the girl in distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as introductory credits, the theme song and such seem, the film lacks because of their absence. It all drops out like an artificial Bond film; very good substitute, but alternate. Bond Rating: 78 points out of 100.
