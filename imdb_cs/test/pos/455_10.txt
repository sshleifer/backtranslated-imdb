I really enjoy this movie. The first time it was at Turner Classic Movies. All the actors performed very well, but Brynner again steals the show as always (it's so sexy!) This is one of the movies you see Brynner's emotions. Actually this movie is the first thing I saw him laughing because he plays very strong, bigger than life and serious roles in other movies. In this film you can see both the masculine and the hard and sensitive aspects of Brynner. Brynner seems to be "ladies'man" in this movie. That's amazing as Brynner eats a glass and speaks in her Russian language that makes me crazy in love. I do not understand when both Brynner and Kerr (both have very good chemistry) stars in the film together and then Brynner always dies at the end it reminds of "King and I" in the way.
