For anyone who has problems with naughty, crazy or unpleasant children, this is a necessary program to watch. It's just a documentary program with the best behavior, not just for tips but for transformations. Very attractive Jo Frost's Supernanny, with fifteen years of nursing experience, now has a program where he shows a family where children are poorly behaved very poorly. Frost is a babysitter who won't let children win. Every episode has small children who are crazy and very, very naughty, eg throwing things, constantly swearing, hitting relatives and parents and many other terrible experiences. But every episode to the end of the show children are transformed by parents (with the help of Frost) from small monsters to lovely children. It's amazing when transformations are successful, Jo Frost is a superb Supernanny. He was nominated for the National Television Award for his most popular subject program (twice). It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. Very Good!
