The 1970s saw the rise and fall of what we saw as "Blacksploitation" Films. The term is a reference to the kind of wide catch-all rather than the actual genre of the film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban cops and robbers-em-ups that are so constructed and so cast to reach the large Urban Black population in the mid-20th century. This could indeed include the widest type of films if it tends to be a black population in the city. It seems that the idea of ​​making these films of particularly interesting interest to black Americans had its origin with the release of Eastertime 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969). In it, former university American footballer Syracuse University and several times the All-Pro Fullback for the Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown, had Co-Starling Billing. He has already appeared in a number of films, such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others. "That Jim was a hot asset. <br /> <br /> Now it's 100 RIFLES brings record numbers of Black patrons to the central business districts of major cities on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown, these adventurous epics and other types of movies with more black players and stars, why not, really. ** So we saw a succession of Cops & Robbers , Bad-ass Private Detective Films, Comedies, All Along the Way, finally we got to some families, wider, more attractive movies that were made on SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and finally on CLAUDINE (1974).> In CLAUDINE we don't find a stigma or easy classification as "Blackploitation" because the story is universal and could easily be done as a story of people descending, anywhere, and not just in the 1970s in the US. <br /> < br /> That p The storyline was made by SINGLE's mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), trying to keep the family behind. two marriages and two almost marriages. "Is far from shooting Harlem style. Problems that plague everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under a sociological microscope. But we also consider Claudin's psychological and physical needs as a woman. For "a woman needs a man and a man, she must have her MATE", *** and we admit it. (This is the SEX we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very masculine, wide shoulder, athletic type in the Garbage Man Private Scavanger, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and goes on a date. The Great Welfare State intervenes with the couple when Claudine's Welfare Case Worker, Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), comes to snooping to see who is this unconnected man who suddenly devotes so much attention to Claudin's family. After the humiliating audit experience of the Social Welfare Office and the "deduction" of a binge that would be the norm for the family, they both decide to marry the Big Brother or not. Meanwhile, Claudin's older son has joined a large group of talking, but few black activists. But with Ruppert's help, he and everyone's going through A.O.K. Ends with Happy, Upbeat and Hopeful note. We know that it may not be exactly "... Fortunately always!", But rather all together! If there is only one criticism that we have to say, it is that sometimes in a film like this, the misconception is spread to a large part of urban blacks. And this is an apparently supposed myth that all whites are rich, who never have any kind of their kind needed for a helping hand, without work, or suffering from some kind of disability. Well, guys, it's just ain It's true! Note: At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as a rough actioner. He was even tense like "... Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing All-Black Casts, filmed for All-Black consumption, was not a new idea. In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s we saw productions by people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr.. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is "As Time goes by", you know, Schultz, it's from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
