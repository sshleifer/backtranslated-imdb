Though Bullet in the Brain is, without a doubt, superior to short films, it very looks more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it's a little hard to apologize for the teacher when his smart ass shoots him. But after the bullet enters his brain, we begin to understand a little why he became such a tired life in the first place. A lot of detail is put into this relatively short film, and that is what makes me feel that it should be a little bit wider - it seems that it's too much to suddenly get because the details are coming to you quickly . A slightly more relaxed pace and less post-narrator in the final section would benefit this film. Despite these complaints, there is no doubt that Bullet In The Brain is quite a huge job compared to many short and even feature films. The creators should be honored for trying to create such an essentially emotional and literate film in the current environment of fast jokes and Hollywood action.
