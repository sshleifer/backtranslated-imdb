What can be said of any other Wilder movie than that it is the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, beats them, haunts them. Billy has created images as images that eternally reflect human condition. He paints good and bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of the biggest movies without the Wilder movie. They will last because they are true. For the first time I saw this movie on television in the 1960s when I was a kid and had to leave the room because I felt tears appear in me and I was embarrassed. Now I'm an old man and I still feel my tears go, but don't leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy has preserved them in this film and not in the way of "the greatest generation", but in the most realistic way that has preserved the power of the human spirit.
