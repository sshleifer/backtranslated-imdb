Pretty fun spoof with great attention to detail re: look at spy films of the sixties and the way the event was staged at that time. The sequence of fighting in the hotel room was hooves and the cast was perfect when Peter Lorre added a lookalike to the rogues mix. Big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is bound without a shirt was the highlight. In addition, eyebrows deserve some kind of recognition for a great job. Funny side: People were still catching up with me in the theater after every conspiracy, as if watching a "real" spy detective. <br /> <br /> It was screened before the "Get Smart" trailer was launched. The preview made the film seem embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate jokes and gags from the TV series. It looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the rather noble OSS 117 jokes and grafts, though, of course, the OSS had its share of failure. However, the overall tone of the OSS was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material did not feel as if it were "stupid." I got a clear impression that if I understood this language, I'd catch more jokes, and one of them (the gun gag) was wrongly interpreted in the subtitles.
