Well, let me say so - I've always been one of the "hard brothers"; I've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal! Therefore, this film is a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies ever (well, except for Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands. Heavenly Hope They will do more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movies like "AC in USA" or what they say, and "8 miles." Bulls ***!) Well, I recommend it anyway, everything What I miss is a few Stratovarius songs, but besides, it's one of the best movies ever!
