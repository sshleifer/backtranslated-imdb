It is a pity that this series has not been remastered and produced by Warner or any other professional film house. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but are usually of poor quality, making copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As I understand, 92 episodes were made during his run, but only 15 are listed here. Some of a number of writers like Richard Matheson went on to become famous authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well-written, well-staged and well-made. Michael Weldon, Udon Thani, Thailand
