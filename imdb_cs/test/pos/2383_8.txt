Scooby Doo and the Mexican monster were undoubtedly the weakest of the modern animated features of Scooby Doo. Loch Ness Monster is a major improvement. This time the gang goes to Scotland to see Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, home of Daphne. And you do not know that the castle is located in the picturesque fishing village of Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness. During their stay they meet several interesting people. First, Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness monster. Sir Ian Locksley, head of the National Heritage Museum in Scotland, is a staunch believer from Nessie. Haggarts, a cozy inn on the lake shore. The sons are a couple of local jokes, always in disaster. Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out and does not stop for anything. Finally, Duncan MacGubbin, a dock master who saw Nessie count too many times. Most of these characters are stereotypes that get a little uncomfortable because it is teaching younger audience load crap and giving a bad impression. However, if you can do it immune, you will be fine. Being from Scotland, I can't help but take on terribly imitated Scottish accents. Fact: That's not how it sounds. Soon Nessie appears, which looks more demonic than "usual" and causes confusion. The gang seems to have another mystery on his hands. Followed by the usual chase scenes, tracks and Shaggy's crazy disguises. There's a lot of laughter. The animation is beautiful, with some atmospheric scenes and places. And the plot is much better than Monster from Mexico. The only bad thing this time is music. I miss Louis Febre's score and the songs are also very rotten. Where Are The Hex Girls When You Need It? Some things are included. Definitely worth getting.
