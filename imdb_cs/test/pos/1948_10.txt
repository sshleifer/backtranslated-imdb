This movie is so eighty and that's what I like about it. It's a great job of expressing that strange decade. The fact that Russian soldiers could wipe you at any time. Reagan in the White House told everyone that things were great, while more and more social programs were interrupted. Young people fell out, but not as far as their parents in the 1960s. Young people still went to school, just smoking so much drug that their sensitivity was just dead. None of them, nor the death of one of their classmates in the hands of one of their friends. How strange it is to realize that murder was bad, but you're not sure why. Watching characters dealing with crime is fascinating and telling about a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable movies I've ever seen.
