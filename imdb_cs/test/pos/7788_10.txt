It's the best Bollywood movie. Best Comedy, Best Actor and Best Direction Too! Rajkumar Santoshi wrote and directed that he is one of the best directors in the field. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked as good as he was. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep behaved as usual! This comedy is still being copied by people and no other writers and directors have done it again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi was unable to recreate this cult classic! This movie was a flop when it released, but it was a cult classic because it released and loved all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. br /> <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. Overall, this film is strongly recommended. If you haven't seen it before, you missed something big! It's a laugh of rebellion and the best comedy I've seen until date! Classic movies like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not half as funny as this. <br /> <br /> BIG FILM, HATS OFF !!!!
