The BBC's blue planet is simply falling. I don't think I would exaggerate to say that it contains some of the most beautiful sequences she has ever captured on film. From known creatures on the ocean's surface and close to some unrecognizable and simple bizarre in the dark depths, it is omitted. Some people who weigh 8 hours may want to look at the modified lights that brought you in the form of "Deep Blue", but I suggest you do the series. I don't think it would be disappointing, and if your kids had fun in the water world that Pixar's Finding Nemo brought to them, I'm sure they'll love it too. I wish the whole television was so fun.
