This movie stuck me in this endless loop thinking about it a few days afterwards ... I was awarded I'm not a movie snob that some people around here seem to be, but I thought it was amazingly well-behaved, and a powerful creature if it lacks a bit of subtlety in execution. by chance, I admire movies that can effectively re-create the feeling of watching the game on stage, creating a harmony that works well with this movie. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so it may be my bias. I personally found that the lack of spatial landmarks is a good thing - it could actually be anywhere and probably be. I say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me, and probably for anyone involved in any political activity.
