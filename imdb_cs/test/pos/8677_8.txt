Imagine a world in which everyone would treat someone nicely, no evil word is ever pronounced, no office bickering, and your boss regularly invites the office crowd to self-service dinners to talk about the latest interior design styles. Everything is elegant, pleasant - well, just nice. In other words, you are in hell. Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), after being dropped in the middle of nowhere, starts a new job as a book manager in a small, clean city. From the outset, he feels strange in this, impersonal world of superficial kindness, surrounded by a pleasant but inanimate interior architecture and so on, colleagues. Food tastes nothing, drinks don't let you get drunk, no kids anywhere; after the initial steps in which he finds himself, Andreas is looking for ways to escape the new world. He no longer knows where he came from, but he still remembers the rich tastes, the real feelings - something that is beyond the boundless life he now leads. PHOTOGRAPHIC MAN professes the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here is the cruelty of ubiquitous, unobtrusive purity. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it is not a narrow-minded bigotry, but rather a myth about our civilization of an urban free world in which it can fit in. Mostly he reminds one of FIGHT CLUB's ingenious scenes, where Edward Norton goes through a false IKEA catalog. This Scandinavian laconic story, spiced with horrifying humor, convinces at every level: story, characters and meaning. A real gemstone screen. 8/10
