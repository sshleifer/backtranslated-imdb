** and 1/2 Star of **** Lifeforce is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, so ridiculous, but at the time it's strangely convincing and never the least boring. Whether it's for nude nudity, the vast amount of violence and action, it all comes together to make 2 hours of cinema fun. Spacehuttle Churchill was sent to investigate Halley's comet when he finds something hiding inside a giant rock coma. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), was sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bats and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid creatures in strange crystalline vessels, two males and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three back, resulting in a disaster. When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. When docked with Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all excited beyond recognition. Humanoids are still in perfect condition and return to London. After various tests, scientists still don't know what these beings are. One night later, a security guard in prison feels compelled to enter the room where the woman is being held. She touches her shoulder and she wakes up, gets up and smiles at him in a seductive and evil way. He approaches him and starts to kiss him when it is clear he will actually take his life force, sucking him out of all his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy). She escapes from the mixture and begins to leave behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought to watch her. Then the men find that there is a certain procedure for life. The guard's body wakes up within two hours and takes the life of a doctor. Every two hours this process seems to repeat the victim. With the help of the only survivor, Churchill, Carl, they try to watch the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a pretty good night out. It has all the elements that could be found in such a film, a lot of nudity, blood / gore and a lot of special effects. This is definitely better than a similarly rendered movie, Kind, thanks to the great part of the thrilling finale. Performance ranges from decent to awful. The far worst is Steve Railsback, who can't beat. Much better are Peter Firth who walks through and convincingly, and the magnificent Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as French actress Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). She can go through virtually the entire role without wearing clothes, and there have been reports that it was hard for her to shoot, so the fact that she is able to go through every scene without moving and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be quite scary, just be seductive. Most of the film can work for her. <br /> <br />
