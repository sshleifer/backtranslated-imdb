The Night Hunter is a sold B-style action movie. Get Life and Grow People. Don "Dragon" Wilson is a kick boxer, (Hall of Fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar, it's not your brother here. Looking for a kick ass action movie with a lower than low budget, this is it. The fence line can be a bit thin but what B movie isn't. I understand that everyone is a critic and how one man's waste is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging every movie like the contestant Oscar, just stupid. Amazing combat scenes, mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. See if your fan, rent something else if your hate.
