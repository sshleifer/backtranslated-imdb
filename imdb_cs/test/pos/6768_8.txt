Adam's apples and with his permission. I didn't know until I was looking for it. Also 'rrrrrrmmmmm' Wilbur wants to kill himself 'I prefer this very focused drama ... the drama over Adam's Apple over the top comedy thrill. But with Your Permission it is much more layered and subtle, but it is another director. Once the "fleshy" part of the story becomes, I felt afraid of returning to the store again and again. A little claustrophobic .. maybe it is intentional. It builds on the atmosphere. You reappear and again and again until the 'shave kick'. It's something fun.
