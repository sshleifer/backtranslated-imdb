One thing I can't really forget about this movie is its beginning: a classic comedy, brilliantly created. I love it. You see it yourself (no spoilers here :-). Sparing between DeVito and Crystal also shines in this film, with DeVito as a perfect oppressed son. One of my favorite. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
