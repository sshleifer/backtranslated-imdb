When HOPPITES ARE IN THE CITY, they find nothing but bad news for their lowland insect neighbors. Can this sincere, good-natured horse save his mistress, Miss Honey Bee, from the evil C. Bagley Beetle machinations - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late? While not one of the great animated features (very new art at the time this movie was created), HOPPITY is a nice movie that should bring joy to uncritical viewers. Technically, it's good, with generally high quality animation. The main drawback of the movie is that none of the characters have any "hearts" - it doesn't come alive on screen as Jiminy Cricket did in PINOCCHIO a year earlier. However it is eventually unfair to compare Fleischer's studio output with Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer should follow their own star; their contribution - and that would be considerable - would be in the area of ​​cartoons with one reel. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they created alternative realities as viable as other cartoon studios. HOPPITY was their second full-length animation experiment (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939) and from now on they would use their energy again on a short cartoon. In fact, the first of the SUPERMAN series has already been released. The story of HOPPITY owes Frank Capra the power to go against the powerful social forces. The original name of the film was truly MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, who immediately refers to Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their adventures Capraesque. Jack Mercer, known as Popeye, talks about two very different characters, the old Mr Bumble & Swat the Fly. Movie mavens should be able to capture the veteran voice actor Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both in uncredited roles. The film has some nice songs delivered by Hoagy Carmichael & Frank Loesser, of which `Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee 'is best known. "We're a couple in the castle" is a gentle romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the film, with its skimming from the heavens and past depth of the New York skyline, is covered behind the opening credits.
