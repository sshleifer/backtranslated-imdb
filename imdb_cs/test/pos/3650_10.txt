Before I forget, let me say that the artwork here is excellent. From the bins to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If it wasn't animated, critics would praise the "direction" because it's really good. To the story: Sylvester chooses garbage in the shipyard, but the pickers are slim. As he watched the dock beside the big ship, he saw Tweety in the cage in the window. Tweety also notices him and knows his first comment - the same thing he does when he sees a cat. Anyway, Sylvester goes over, opens the window and says, "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety hits the window through the window of his face and says, "You're an old, peeping cat!" The cat falls into the water. The untouched Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard the ship, tipping into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - There's a "grandmother" at the door with an umbrella. Sylvester beats because old lady protects her home bird again. But, "gibbet flippets," Granny says, "I dropped my glasses. I can't see anything without 'em. Now Sylvester's upstairs ... and normal cats trying to catch birds are alive again, like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most reliable act was to wear glasses and paint a Tweety picture on them, so when she woke up and turned on, she saw a bird and thought it was okay. Very fun animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can quote, I love the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
