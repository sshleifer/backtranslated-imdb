It was unusual: a modern film that was very enjoyable. In fact, it was so nice that it borders on being too hard to believe in its part. When I watched this story based on real life, I thought, "no one is so nice, this tolerant." Especially I talked about the role of Ed Harris as "Coach Jones". I think they went a little overboard for his character, but that's better than the opposite: showing him worse than what he was in real life. It's strange that Harris also plays a role because he has a long sequel to playing ugly, profane characters. Anyway, I never have to complain about a nice, good movie and it's nice to see a lot of good-sense, kind people. These people drive their friendship, love and compassion for "James Kennedy," better known as "Radio", a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Good work with this role too. However, like Sean Penn's role of mentally-challenged man in "I'm Sam," an hour-and-character half like this is a lot. After that, the volume of those guys is tedious to hear. Note: In one of the documentaries on this DVD it was interesting to find that in real life in recent years for "Radio" to do its transformation, not months as shown in the movie.
