PLOT IN NUTSHELL: Dave Seville, father and manager of the Chipmunks brothers Alvin, Simon & Theodore, went on a business trip to Europe and left the boy at home with Miss Miller as an observer, much to Alvin's liking. who wanted to go to Europe. While playing against his female counterpart, Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, consisted of her younger sisters Jeanette (the female counterpart of Simon) and Eleanor (the female counterpart of Theodore) in a wild arcade game Around the World in 30 days, They need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way to do that, they will not attract the attention of their enemy arch Jamala. Two evil siblings, Claudia & Klaus, hear a joke between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as boys and girls for their prey (more Claudia than Klaus, the other feels too dangerous for children initially). Two siblings make an offer for boys and girls - Travel through air balloons to 12 drop off points to leave dolls (which resemble children) that contain diamonds and / or money to show their arrival, with the promise of whoever wins the race \ t . But how two different sets of talking animal siblings make their rounds are followed by Jamal followers - but who is Jamal? Is he a friend or an enemy? OVERALL: Pleasant, light farce based on the TV series Alvin & Chipmunks of the 1980s. Beautiful animation is the highlight, lacking coarse humor that continues to creep into today's family movies and engaging songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll, which are excelled). Eagle Eyed fans are likely to notice that the Brittany character design has been enhanced from the animated series, giving it a less rounded face while adding seemingly permanent blush on the faces (which Jeanette & Eleanor also display). Keep Ear for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
