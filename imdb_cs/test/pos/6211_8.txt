When I first saw Colleen Moore, it was in an excellent series of silent films called "Hollywood". There she was in 1980, her hair defiantly rocking, as it was in the 1920s, the sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "presence". Then I saw her fairytale silent work in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the disappointingly deafening talkie "The Scarlet Letter". And now he's here in "The Power and the Glory", which gives power to stunning power, working professionally with one of the best actors in talking cinema - Spencer Tracy. The movie I found a little lacking of story-wise glitter, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly matters. Both actors are aging from youth to old age - mostly through self-negotiation with minimal makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unknowable as an older woman, and the scene where she finds her husband sees a younger woman is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, where her quiet acting experience gives her an advantage, even through Tracy. Contrast it with her wonderful comic gaming in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and Tracy tries to design her. Astonishing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful Hollywood has let this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life retired.
