I have heard interesting criticisms about this film. I believed it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what it was about. When I finally saw it, I found myself in the midst of a love affair between ex-con Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and junkie Ruf (Sebasti√°n Haro). So, a love story, but probably not what I expected. The film is aimed at Isabel as he tries to get back to society. She doesn't want to go back to her surroundings and find herself homeless or anywhere. While she had experienced the first hours of freedom after being released from prison, she encountered Rufo, an old surrender to her, who was an addict at the time she was living and lives on the streets. When he has nowhere to go and without money or a possible source of income, he decides to join Ruf on his residence: in a sheltered place on a lonely street. The story itself moves. This explains how, impossible, the relationship between Isabel and Rufo gets deeper until the almost last twist of the film. Definitely, the film is worth watching. Sebastian Haro is great in his role as a drug addict. A person who is capable of being both innocent and gentle, and ruthless street dirt. It depends only on who is trading with him. I believe his role is. On the other hand, I don't think Isabel Ampudia's role. Although the film tries to show bitterness inside it through several scenes, she is not able to believe me. She is too sweet and sincere to expect from someone in the same situation. The film tries to show love in a desperate situation. It's a nice movie. But the feeling that I get when the film is over is that Isabel, with the way she thinks and acts, has never come to that situation. Her role, partly due to the script, partly due to acting, is hard to believe. Especially I like the ending, so I increased my rating by one or two points. I liked his bitterness and the fact that sometimes, the survival instinct is beyond other spiritual considerations like love. Summary, interesting movie, but lacked a blow that would be "must see" in total.
