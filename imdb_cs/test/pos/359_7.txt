As the second of Chaplin's Essanay films, CARMEN is a parody of the drama Cecil B. Demill with the same name. Obviously, Demill's acclaimed film has captivated so much of a comedy king he later admitted in his autobiography. The parody for Chaplin was not a new experiment. Several of them have already done so, namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB, so he would do it until the end of his film career (for example, A KING IN NEW YORK). Chaplin has a very good portrayal of Don Jose and Edna Purviance is very good as Carmen. Do not act as we are used to; Charlie is not a nice Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but it wasn't even Chaplin's intentions. BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat strange Chaplin film, very different, but contains good material. The main story is, though very differently structured, as in the original drama. Don Jos√© is in love with Carmen, but he is not alone in this area; "Carmen, Carmen, (beautiful) Carmen, is loved by all men under 96," but she has the great advantage of being an officer, and there we are; this is a famous story about rivalry, love, greed and honor, seen from a humorous perspective. Thanks to the performance of Chaplin and Purviance and the wonderful, wonderful music of George Bizet, which I admire very much, it could be a real masterpiece near the comedy, it's a time to consider. It could have been. But unfortunately, although it is a good pretty good comedy, I do not feel fair to blame people who claim that BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. However, it is important to remember that this has nothing to do with the lack of talent, but rather as a result of business conflicts. When Chaplin refused to sign Essanay again after completing his last film for POLICE, they revenge themselves by editing all the scenes Chaplin originally released from CARMEN. This makes the film somewhat confusing and has a few pointless scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the film turned out to be Ben Turpin's feature - Turpin played Remendados - than Chaplin-short. Naturally, Chaplin was in despair when he found out what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days. Despite its obvious shortcomings, BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is recommended to Chaplin's fans and admirers of beautiful music.
