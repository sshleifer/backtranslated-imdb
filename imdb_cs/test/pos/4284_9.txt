There are plenty of more intricate plots of this amazing movie that provokes thoughts rather than infidelity and concealment of accident responsibility. I was struck by the initial seeming goodness of Wilkinson's husband, who wanted a driver when he thought it was Everett, published by the police, and a change of heart (and morality) when he learned that he was his wife. Likewise, he was really good and / or trying to redeem himself by allowing her to go with Rupert. Then things that alternated and SHE decided it was right. Most importantly, the subject of redemption (for an accident - for infidelity - in its own particular, erroneous manner) is the strongest in Watson's care for Everett. I believe this is why she has made this effort. This topic seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, the end of the affair comes to mind. I love it.
