Thank you FilmZone for being at 1 am He discovered this slippery soft sex. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore, and of course talented Chloe Nicholle (like Rebecca Carter). The production values ​​are really bad mainly because of the low budget, but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography makes it look like a hard core porn movie. There is no effort at all in the lightning. But let's not forget this, because we're honest, watching "Pleasures of Sin" because of the high amount of sex. The sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy, explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle delivers the best female cast performance. So my advice is, watch this movie if you're in the mood for a good explicit sex or just watch if you're a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for sex scenes; Don't expect anything else.
