The film offers one of the greatest experiences for movie visitors. It is by no means a pleasant film, but it offers reality and emotions that the human mind should never touch. This opens the way in how an individual thinks and then changes a person forever. When I first saw this movie in the classroom, and after seeing it, I had to skip my next class and walk around the campus to restore my body and mind. I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I did not exist. It was only a few months later, when I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she said, "Oh, it's when you ran after what you saw and ran on me when I was about she spoke strangely? " I didn't even remember slipping or talking to someone the day I was on that day. In terms of conspiracy it is a simple story of a couple torn apart by war. There is suffering greater than the suffering of the dead, and to the end ... there are no words to complement the image Bergman creates. It's like a horrible dream that causes you to wake up and change your own reality forever. This movie has to be seen.
