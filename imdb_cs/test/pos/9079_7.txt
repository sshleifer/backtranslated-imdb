Someone I know said there was a movie called flatliners that was probably on my street. I was told about this movie after watching the ultimate goal 2 and watching another feature near the deth experience. I bought a flat-screen DVD at a modest price of Â£ 5. I have a home and watched it. And I couldn't help but smile and feel good when I was wondering how this movie wasn't in my life. The film is about a group of medical students trying to find out what it's like after a near death experience. But then sins return to reality and can hurt them physically. Behavior from Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is great as you would expect from a couple. And Joel Schmacheur made a great movie about it, like he did with the lost boys. This is a nervous and stylish thriller that will appeal to a film fan.
