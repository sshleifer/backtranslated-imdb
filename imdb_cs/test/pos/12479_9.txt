Great artists have always suffered when they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not it. This film was created by HG Clouzot, whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal profession. The greatest actor and director of French theater before and after World War II. Both had health problems. Clouzot had TB while young, Jouvet had heart problems and died in the theater. Such events shape the character of men (and of course women). You could even say that today's artists are so poor because they have never suffered or fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> It's the biggest of Clouzot's movies for me. "Wages of fear" is greater in "tension", "Diabolique" also has more "tension" and better plot and is more about "female evil". Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's escort (mostly communists and Jews) of working with the Nazis and banned from making movies until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958, as president. The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can act as a "putain" on stage, but she's not a "whore" (dictionaries make synonyms of these words but aren't the same), loves her husband, and refuses mild "Advances from her (probably Lesbian) friend Dora, photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice's husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the crime scene. A coward because he fell in love with a woman and eventually exchanged a more upscale career for love Gray "No Noir, Like EG Robinson in" Double Indemnity ") shows a sense of pseudo criminal, tenderness for Negro's son (?), And sympathy for the true author of crime, because he remembers that the father is cleansed by latrines at some noble Castle! put it in the right frame of mind, but deep inside it was very human. <br /> <br /> I have my horoscope ahead of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means openness, devotion, love and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincere apology ...
