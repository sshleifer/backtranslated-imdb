When I first saw this movie about 6 months ago, I thought it was interesting, but a little more. But that stayed with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and response had more to do with the real quality of VHS than with the film itself. I bought the DVD Criteria kit and turned out to be the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It's exciting, and I'm sure he managed to achieve the main goal: propaganda against the Germans. This is the most common criticism against this film and against Eisenstein that he is just a propagandist and nothing else. It's untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important who lived. So far, the world is far behind Joseph Stalin to watch Eisenstein's films as art.
