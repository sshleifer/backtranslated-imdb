I have never been tired of being a medical / paramedical retirement to a vinyard toiler when I see this film. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college teacher and visited him and us during several classes in 1958. His writing skills became a test of time and "Hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. Week and something new. So many supportive members have occupied even bigger and better roles in television and film. George Scott made only a few comedies, but his timing and patter are as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor rather than physical / grotesque wins in my book every time. And a family movie with only one four-digit word throughout the movie
