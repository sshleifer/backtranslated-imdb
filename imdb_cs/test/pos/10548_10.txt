This is one of my favorite movies. One of those movies where I know every row but can still watch repeatedly without losing interest. I always go for this movie when I go on vacation, or when I don't want to go to the gym, just when I see the beautiful body of Nikki, it will be the motivation I need. It's easy to watch a movie that always keeps me smiling, but I know it won't be used to all the cup of tea, but if like you love movies that are shot beautifully and have a comedy, romance and interesting plot you will love. It is filled with big characters and Ben and Nikki are both beautiful, so someone can watch something appealing. BOTTOM LINE ..... IT'S GET IT ALSO! One day I watched him on TV and loved him that I had to go out and watch him, which took some time and I could watch him every day. MY OTEC HERO I love you !!!
