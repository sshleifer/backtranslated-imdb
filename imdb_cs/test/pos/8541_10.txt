Do you know those movies that are incredibly awful, but you can't help them, but do you love them? That's what Evil Ed is, maybe the best horrible movie in the world. Sound is waste, dubbing is crap, the script is nonsense and special effects are pap. But I can't help but have loved the movie over the years. Sam Campbell (or whoever plays it) should be featured on Actor's Studio because it's unforgettable. Probably the biggest movie thief who hasn't been named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect a lot, you won't be disappointed. Keep an easy access to watch this movie and you'll be rating it ten times soon.
