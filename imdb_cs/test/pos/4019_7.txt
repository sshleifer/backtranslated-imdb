Just like the first movie in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to just mark this "blaxsploitation film". Sure, defeat is hard, artillery, black, but it is rather an action picture regardless of the color of the front man or the bad guy - and a very good action figure. In the second and last time Jim Brown plays the title character. The film begins with one of the most beautiful scenes I remember in the film. As Slaughter and his friends are looking forward to the outdoor party, the biplane comes and starts spraying a machine gun group! No, Slaughter is not that hard to shoot down a plane with his .357! But Slaughter is checked out and no one is sure why it happened - but Slaughter gets to the end! It turns out that the attempt was made in retaliation for the last film. In that, killing takes Mafia and kicks a lot of ass down in Mexico. Now, in a terribly confused and clumsy attempt, aircraft killers kill and injure quite a few people, but miss Slaughter. And because the job was so confused, the mob boss (Ed MacMahon !!) orders the pilot and gunner killed by his brutal murderer (Don Stroud - in a very typical type of role for him). Stroud is great - scary and ugly to the core, but Ed MacMahon as the boss?! Wow, this is an interesting twist! The defeat is now tense. He figured out who the two guys were on the plane, but they were dead when he got to them. So, to help him together in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the gangsters were, who ordered the hit and got Slaughter to agree to do some illegal secret work. So, Slaughter and his pimp friend get into the gangster's mansion and steal a list of payouts to key government and police officials. And naturally, there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in this process. Stroud is not about making Slaughter get into it and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a standoff - Slaughter has a list, but if she doesn't return, the lady is dead. Being a hard but gallant man can only be able to guess what happens next. The action is very good in the movie and Jim Brown is terrible and tough. The only negative I noticed was that while MacMahon would play an ugly boss, he just folded at the end - and too fast. When Slaughter catches up with him, MacMahon becomes a werewolf and all the previous ugliness disappears - and that is too clich√© and inconsistent. Yet, despite this tiny argument, it is an engaging film that is not for children because of all the violence and breasts.
