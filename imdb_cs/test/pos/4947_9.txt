Iron Eagle has long been one of my favirote movies. It seems that Topgun, but with a different plot and (a lot of people will disagree with me), is in my opinion better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has amazing scenes where fighter jets approach the air. She also has a Queen song "One Vision" in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good, but its sequel was garbage. > <br />
