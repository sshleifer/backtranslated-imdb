This Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle Comedy is best remembered for featuring a young Buster Keaton, fresh from the split with his family's rude Vaudeville Act, in his film debut. Buster is very involved in this movie and it's pretty funny. "The Butcher Boy" has a lot of laughter and is an example of a pure old-fashioned grotesque done well, though it seems to come from a short era of two-cylinder comedies where filmmakers still think it's a single reel segment. course. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a grocery store. It is an excuse to take advantage of the many possibilities of rapid physical humor provided by the general store, and Arbuckle really shows that it is 300 pounds of acrobat, which illustrates the subtlety, skill and grace in its performance of what could have been Routine routine routines, raise to a different level. The running gag occasionally turns it around with a large butcher knife so that it turns exactly into the stuck position in the cutting board, and I'm still impressed that Arbuckle really does it every time. There is also a really nice gag that sees that it rests on its scale and confused why its meat cuts so much. Buster Keaton is a boy who comes to buy some molasses, and performs skillfully following the routine that follows. In addition to the strange and almost disturbing graceful smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language instantly recognize him as Buster we know. He even has his own protective hat - destroyed here for the first time when filled with, of course, molasses. The second half of the film goes into more situations based comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John dressed up to get into the boarding school of Fatty's girlfriend. Much humor also comes from the generally unreal and mysterious laughter of looking at these two strange people who stretch and try to be "girls." The buster is also in this segment, but usually stands there in an occasional cutout that helps St. Jankovi. The end of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a little empty frenetic, but overall and beyond, the historical interest of curiosity, it's a well-done comedy that only gets knockabout laughter it will be.
