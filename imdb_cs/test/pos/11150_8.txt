I am really surprised that this movie has only a 6.4 rating when I made this review. Though it's not a great movie, I think it's one of the best movies Dietrich has made, and it's a pity it's no more. I think a lot of the reasons I liked the movie so much is that the usual stupid dietrich personality like "über-vamp" isn't present and her role required her to act. I hate seeing a movie after a movie after the early days of her career, where she looked more like a cartoon or cliché than a real woman. I do not necessarily blame Dietrich for the silly vampire films she made in the 1930s - viewers loved them and made her famous. But here she showed that she could really act. After all, when I was looking at her in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and BLUE ANGEL, who guessed she was busy to play Gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because this casting decision, but it worked - was pretty believable and a lot of fun to watch the same! The film is basically a vehicle for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - other supporting characters are very secondary in the film. Milland is a wanted spy in Germany before World War II, and in his quest to escape he encounters a somewhat risky lonely Gypsy (Dietrich) who immediately brings him to the fulfillment of prophecy - in other words, his new lover! Milland is quite stuffy, but reluctantly agrees to travel in her car - even to body and ear to make him look like a gypsy (that is, the title of the movie). Over time, she slowly begins to realize that under her very non-slip exterior she is quite a woman and the romance is slowly blossoming. The movie in one word is "charming". Pleasant romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the picture Hollywood wants to buy. Please also note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic in the short time he was on the film, and I loved his deep and beautiful voice. Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film is set in Germany, no mention is made of the coming Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout Germany, the Nazis exterminated a huge percentage of the Roma and so the last nice ending of the film is tad appealing.
