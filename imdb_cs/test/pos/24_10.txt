"Sir" played Lear over 200 times, but tonight he can't remember his opening lines. Sitting at the mirror, his eyes reflect the king of madness. His dresser asks him gently, mouth words. There is air of despair about both of these men. The great actor knew that his forces were slipping away, his valet cum main domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss drop into madness and because he knew he was powerless to help him. "The Dresser" is really a love story between two. Over the years, they have become dependent on each other to the extent that neither can understand the future without the other. Set during World War II, it concerns the fates of a sincerely second-rate Shakespearean Company tour involving the same number of bees and wannabes led by "Sir", a theater knight of what might be kindly called "Old School" Whether Playing Any Part , catching center - stage and moss over skylights, shocking their audience to applause. But somewhere inside him, buried most of the time deep under the ham, regularly goes out, there is still an occasional glitter of his earlier size to capture that his audience is hoping. Mr A. Finney is very cleverly focused on ham, often up to the point of caricature, and just as you are ready to reject his performance as mere exaggeration and waste, he creates a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realize that a great actor plays a great actor. The same is true for Mr. T.Courtenay.It is easy to write off his views <br /> <br /> Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. Here we have a middle aged womanish rather than a theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life, enjoying the company "The Girls "and loving the sinister Insider gossip in" The Theater ".There was - and I am still a suspect - many men, as well as Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient, know more about Play more than many actors, behind the scenes with wisdom and with affection, I believe that the vast majority of them would hide with the approval laughter with Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw "The Dresser" on the London scene, where Mr Courtenay's "Norman" was somewhat more subdued than in the film. "Sir," the great Mr. Freddie Jones played a great response from the audience. was an unforgettable performance that obscured Mr. Courtenay, which limited him to "also - run" as opposed to level - billing actor. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without leaving each other. window. "Norman" was reduced to his puppet, which I am not sure what Ronald Harwood intended, but made for a breathtaking theater. Finney and Courtenay correct the film's balance and restore equality in relationship. Both men have come a long way from their first performances in the British "New Wave" images when they became darlings of a vaguely left-wing, "middle class and ashamed of it" movement.When a British cinema virtually committed Hari-kiri in the 1970s, quietly focused on the theater, unlike several roles that kept the wolf from the door. With the renaissance of the more important films they reappeared, blinking in unusual bright light. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" marked their comeback, still fizzing with energy and talent, screaming at the world as a whole, "We're still here." It's not a big movie, but it's certainly big.
