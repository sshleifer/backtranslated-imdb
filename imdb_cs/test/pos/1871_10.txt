One of the best sitcoms that runs on Indian TV along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. A great performance, a good pace and an extremely entertaining script made him a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening assembly (sung by anyone but the inimitable Kishor Kumar) provided a very accurate picture of what to expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library after Doordarshan stopped broadcasting it. I wish Indian TV to go back to series like these rather than asinine saas-bahu soaps and realistic television that is good for all these days. Anyone who finds a really good comedy should go and get this series. You can also enjoy a few Pakistani situational comedies, such as ups and downs and aik auras, which are certainly comparable to the best Indian.
