Like many twilight zone episodes, one of my favorite parts of this movie was the obvious social note Serling does with the story. As was the case with the recent "Howling Man" episode, I was warned of my long suspicion that, for example, if Jesus came to earth to bring his followers to heaven, he would be immediately judged and probably thrown. asylum. Our main character in this episode encounters a similar problem when he tries to convince the 1860s Americans that he is from the future and President Lincoln is about to assassinate. The episode wrongly states that this means that some parts of the past may be changed while others can't, but it's a fun time to travel. history could be changed over time because time travel has never been achieved, and unfortunately it will never be. But it seems logical that if you could physically face the past, you could physically prevent something that would happen if it didn't crawl like a fool screaming about assassinations. One of the consistently interesting things about time films and TV shows, in my opinion, is the way in which time travel takes place. There is no method at all, our main character has a time travel conversation in a classy gentleman's club and then goes out and dissolves from the early 1960s to the mid-1960s, but no matter what. The twilight zone has not yet caught me for its complex files or high production values. Russell Johnson plays the role of Peter Corrigan, a passenger in time, and after finding himself being transported back in some way. The exact day of Lincoln's murder, he manages to throw himself in jail, but fortunately for him John Wilkes Booth just hung in the police station for some reason and heard the furious Corrigan, who desperately tried to describe this assassination. Booth was planning that night. Booth asks Corrigan for custody for some psychiatric experimentation and the policeman sees nothing wrong with giving up this bond. After all, he had a business card, how bad could it be? It seems that the show suggests that you can change people's lives by changing past events on the way of time, and when I'm not willing to accept that traveling time would include such limitations, it's still a fun episode that really makes you think which is one of my favorite features of good twilight zone shows ...
