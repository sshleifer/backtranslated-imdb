I was a "huge" fan of rushing from "moving pictures" and this concert is just a case for anyone who is a fan of why Rush is so popular. They fully confessed to playing the biggest concert ever, and despite the rain in the football arena, they still manage to deliver excellent performance from start to finish. The real example of this is during the "yyse" that the entire crowd begins to sing with it in a real classical way, in a perfect sinc. They really play all the favorite songs of each of them with a really strong "desire" that rarely happens. You get the best place in the house for one of their best gigs. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary about the band when they are in Brazil and shows you a lot of behind the scenes that happen, allowing them to see not only musicians but also real people in their daily lives. This DVD gift set is a must for all young Rush fans and is sure to hold your DVD collection. It's even a CD concert for those who want to listen to music. This DVD is worth it!
