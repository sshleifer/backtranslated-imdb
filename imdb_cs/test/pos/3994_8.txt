This film, which was won by Im Kwon-Taek in Cannes in 2002 (tied to P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with companion roots and a significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that Im is trying to help us see through the painter's eyes, so we see several scenes and objects that help our drunken painter, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik). inspiration. Costumes and artistic direction are all impressive and the performances remain good. It's not a movie that moved me, but that was what made me think about art and what it meant to find a voice in it. That's pretty cool. It is also interesting to see the version of Korea in those times just before the turn of the century, where Chinese and Japanese forces are in both Korea and the Chosun kingdom. More than one revolution and political ideology are collected in the film, but they are never the center. It's hard on the painter. Finally, it's a good movie about the life of a painter. But it does not have a regular chart of three acts, so you must be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story. Yay for art! 8/10
