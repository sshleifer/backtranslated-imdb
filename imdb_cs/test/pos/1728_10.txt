Frankly, I don't understand why this exhibition was so much discussed. It includes original elements as it expands on them. Storytelling has been updated, and some of the episodes seem a bit "fast", which is a good thing. Christopher Eccleston is perfect in this role. Easily as good as Tom Baker. Rose is one of the best companions, on the same level as Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that timelords have been destroyed - No more sorry for a doctor who acts as a presidential emeritus. The character adds something to be the only one. <br /> <br /> SFX is excellent - especially when compared to the original. Take it from me (And I was a huge geek Dr Who - I was actually taking notes when I watched the show all the way from Dr # 1 to Dr # 8) horrible movie from cannon, personally.
