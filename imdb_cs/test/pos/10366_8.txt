Count me as one who likes to see no Hastings in this episode. Dr. Watson will do nothing to me because he pulls every scene he is in. Japp is often necessary for the story as a representative of the officials and little Miss Lemon is good for the spice, but Hastings swings painfully in various episodes is dark to too much behaved. If I have to sit one more blank "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. As a general rule, the more Poirot you get in the Poirot story, the better. Every line for Hastings is taken from Poirot. And I've never read books, so I don't really care about Christie's loyalty. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem with separating movies from books. If you want the book as written, then read it. I don't see the sense of watching a TV version if you know what comes up at every stage. Theater is not prose - do not expect transcription.
