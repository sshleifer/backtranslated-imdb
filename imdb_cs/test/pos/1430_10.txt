The controversial, panoramic crime drama Otto Preminger, a man with a golden arm, plays between the mental descriptions of his living and architectural inhabitants, in a rhythmic, whipping arrangement. Opening the film, a close-up of Frankie's bar looking through the window tells us that what the protagonist will perceive as a subjective experience. The film stretched toward ever weaker spaces, and the movie shuts down because the long stretched gangster poker game closes off the daylight, slips into itself as the Frankie machine from Sinatra is locked in the room on the famous scene. His horrific fight overcome his habit. The visibility in the Man with the Golden Arm is immersed in the shapes and faces of his jazz city haven and characterizes the sloping psychological circumstances that create a strong environment, as evidenced by repeated tracking into the details of Frankie's eyes. The grace of this fiery drama, conspicuous from the exciting opening of the crane, shows a command over the perceptible world that studio production allows. Wonderfully dilapidated urban arrays define an independent site without beginning or ending, an indeterminate state that in fact hardly lasts until this shear line appears to have been gentrified or aligned. The mood of certain performances, especially Robert Strauss, as the amazingly named chief boss of the underworld bosses Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's trusted four-legged dog, is pleasing to this fiery surrealistic feature. The assumption of drug dependence, the performance of Sinatra's power, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, energetic jazz score, and the famous, influential and controversial opening sequence of Saul Bass, aimed at cutting out animated paper from a heroin addictive arm, ensured that the man with the Golden Hand was pushing in his era forward to the cause of realism in ever-restrained Hollywood. It is impressionist and subjective, as I say, but his intention, strength and spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What engulfs me most in this film is his gangster movie aspect. It has illegal card games, short drawbacks, fights, weapons, double crosses, llama characters, femme fatale, tremendously sexy moll gun, shady nightclubs and urban landscapes, but it does more than use this amusement environment. Indeed, it is the perfect environment and genre in which to tell this story, a city district located in crimes where everything is too easy to escape through a bottle or two, three or four or medication, a transient dose, really just works to keep there is some enlightenment in the darkness and all the clear scenarios the world can offer.
