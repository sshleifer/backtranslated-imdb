There are films that make a career. For George Romero it was the LIVING DEAD NIGHT; for Kevin Smith, CLERKS; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to this list Onur Tukel is absolutely amazing DING-A-LING-LESS. Flawless filming, and as sure and professional as any of the above films. Since I saw FULL MONTY, I didn't laugh like that. (And yet I don't think I laughed so hard like that ... So talk.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of peace that one should sit with a copy of this scenario and make a line- by-line exploration to fully appreciate its width and width. Every shot is beautifully composed (a clear hint of the director with a certain hand) and the performances all around are solid (there is no one of the best scenic chews to expect from such a movie). DING-A-LING-LESS is a movie whose time has come.
