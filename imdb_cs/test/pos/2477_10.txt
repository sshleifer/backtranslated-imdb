I enjoyed this film well, although it sometimes turns into a stereotypical situation. At that time, I did not understand whether there was a "Penalty Park" in the past, but I do not think there is a thing here. <br /> <br /> You must look at this film in a different way. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world that is driven by violence and that no one can escape it. If someone refuses to "take over his responsibility" then you will be fired from our company ... All our history is made up of wars, and we should never forget that. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that we may change and understand that our "intellectual skills" have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In two words this movie needs to be seen, maybe it will help us accept the truth ...
