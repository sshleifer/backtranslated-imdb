I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it didn't fit into the movie. The rest of the imaginary heroes, however, portrayed a realistic family that goes through realistic issues like death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn they were my family, no joke. Emile Hirsch was absolutely believable as a teen struggling with his brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays a mother trying to keep the remains of her family (slightly) dysfunctional family together. Although this family can take its problems to the limit, anyone can relate to what they are going through, whether it's graduation, living as expected or being a parent.
