This movie sat in a dusty pile of videos in my house before we watched it. We knew it was there - every time someone wanted to watch a movie, it was designed. It almost became a joke ... "I know, look at the Momma throwing train" ... I don't know why it was always rejected, it just was. We knew a little about what we were missing. I still wonder why it took us so long ... I mean the stars of Danny DeVit, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsa (which we called "The Lady from the Goonies"). everyone in my home. But there it was for almost ten years. Until one day it was designed and we couldn't do it again .... It was like finding the tomb of King Tut ... <br /> <br /> No movie ever made me laugh so hard, and I doubt any movie ever was. I had to rewind to almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that stood before her, and I lost the ability to hear or pay attention. It's not just plain laughter, either ... the kind of laughter that spends more energy than running ten miles cold. The kind of laughter that you can't control, which causes cradling and cramps, and tears and snot runs down your face because it's just so weird funny. As soon as I learned that the movie by heart, I will say that this effect has diminished, but I do not think that I will be tired of watching it and looking for new jokes. I think I can say that. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't like it, please let me know I'll probably be offended.
