£ 3.50 A DVD can be a gamble and it was the one that paid off. A decent movie of the Saturday night, having fun overlooking obvious mistakes. Special effects are a bit few and far from having some reps (and why does London always look like it was in the '60s?) <br /> <br /> If it had a budget, say, Armageddon then I'm sure it would be better at the box office as the story is pretty good. Overall, Tycus is posted to B Movie History, but if you see it at £ 3.50 then it's worth buying.
