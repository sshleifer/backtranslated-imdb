Probably the best comedy in a long time. keep you laughing nonstop! Acting is good and there are plenty of cheerful portraits like Ben Stiller as a guitarist. The storyline was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy would define it. I can only hope for continuation because they seem to be able to do much more. Although it was 1 hour and 40 minutes, I still wanted to end even more :) Also there is a scene after credits that is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie !! I suggest it to anyone who loves good comedy and will definitely suggest it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should buy the album as well, the songs are so damn catchy and fun, the music is also Top Notch.
