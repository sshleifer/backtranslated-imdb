This is the final feature film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts to his short story collection "That Bowling Track on Tiber". In addition to the Clouds, they contain 4 stories with familiar motifs that we have become accustomed to from his earlier works, and summarize these themes in vignettes that are combined together with Wenders' directorial scenes with director John Malkovich. Most stories, however, seem to offer little or no depth to what we are accustomed to from the movie Antonioni, while Malkovich's narrative of the supposed depth rattled with an unclear diction that sounded dull and unobtrusive. Br /> However, all four stories touch random encounters and extremely fast romances, which at first glance seemed more like lust, perhaps due to lack of time (because they are short stories) that allow more layered approach to careful definition and craftmanship characters as we know from the typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive attitude here means that the characters break up to show the lack of a deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the body. Maybe that's why you want to pass on with a more modern relationship? The First Story, A Love Story That Never Existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre) who meet when someone asks for a trip to the hotel and later meets in cafe. It's like Fate playing games when they meet, but they meet a lot later, but just as people play, it's almost like L'Avventura or La Notte with a lack of communication and expectation from a man. The character of director John Malkovich has a central role in the next short period, showing some really delicate views of a girl working in a shop played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply upset and uncomfortable, but in some way she got rid of the courage to approach him, and in what I thought scared him, she tells him that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in the flash, these two are off towards the bedroom gymnastics. Another short, Don't Look for Me, is the longest of the series, with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, Fanny Ardant. Maybe the more stars bouncing from the game, and Jean Reno also stepped on the stage at the end, extending the small universe in which this short piece exists. Unfortunately, Reno's engagement was also in a grin of laughter that plunged into the unlikely domain of laser fast romantic tangles. There was a key element modified from L'Eclisse with a kiss between the couple over the glass panel as well, while the introductory story about the soul story was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme, this short wants to play, it will be a duplication of man. Between this short and the next was a small screenplay that met with a couple from La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former paints a landscape that reminded her of Red Desert. Finally, we have the final shot of This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez as the young man behind the girl (Irene Jacob) he has just met and fell in love with just to realize that it's love that is too late . It's quite an interview, just like the first story, with the characters taking part in the conversation as they walk the streets of the city they're in, reminiscent of Richard Linklater Before Sunrise. Overall, the film may have succeeded as a single piece, but it has never been much like a combined effort for an "apology" that would link them to a film director who explored possible stories and sought inspiration for his another movie.
