I heard about this case, but during the entire Fuhrman hooply, who wrote the book, Skakel was arrested, so I did not pay attention, but this film did a great job of detailing Martha, the Skakely brothers, the murder, the involvement of Mark Fuhrman and the results of his investigation . I especially liked the flashback footage with Marta about her last summer. The actress who played it literally shone with her life and made her even more touching that the real Martha was like that. Martha seemed to be a real person rather than a victim. I would definitely recommend watching it.
