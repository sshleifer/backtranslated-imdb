Walter Matthau is best remembered by a long series of comedies he made with his equal partner Jack Lemmon from FORTUNE COOKIE to ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that with the end of the 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. That was Glenda Jackson, an English two-time Oscar winner who showed his comic abilities against Matthau first in the HOUSE CALLS and then in the HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was somewhat larger in both films because his characters were more focused on graphs, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you've ever wanted to see two professionals demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazy about Walter and Glenda's watches as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson are experimenting to see if two people could have sex on the bed under the old movie code rule of both sides each having one foot on the floor! Sex has never been watched from a clinical and mechanical point of view. Matthau's Charlie was just widowed before the film began. He had only one wife in his life - his wife. So now he's an eligible bachelor. He is also the chief surgeon at the hospital he is working from, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the movie that shows he turns his senility and off - see the scene where he collides Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is re-elected (Charlie is his closest competitor to the post - if he wants to). But Amos manages to persuade Charlie to let him work for self-esteem. One day Charlie notices Ann at the hospital. She had a slight accident and was resting in bed, but Amos put it in a cage of a similar apparatus (which he had not used Charlie's notes since 1920). He pulls it out of the device and soon begins to balance it. She joins the hospital staff, but she is critical to Charlie's willingness to care for Amos, and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies that she sees among doctors in the hospital. Amos' bungling causes the death of a wealthy hospital patron (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate reception costs for double headers). Amos is trying to reassure the young widow of the team's owner, pass on eulogies in the funeral service (the line in the above list is the eulogy anniversary). However, she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most competent he has ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie's romance widow satisfy her from that dear court. But how will Ann react? The film is quite amusing, and was so successful that in addition to causing the sequel to Jackson and Matthau, it led to a television series as well.
