"Don't look into the basement" is so easy to knock, but the truth is that Brownrigg is one of the real underground stars of Horrors and IMHO is initially recognized. "No" is his undisputed masterpiece. This dirty psychodrama instantly captures the viewer into such a strange, incoherent, claustrophobic world of sweating madness that you have no real idea of ​​what the hell is going on. You can make yourself feel strangely dirty, just plain, for Brownrigg's world, this crazy, unwashed, dirty prison cell of boasts, obsessions, and all shades of mental illness. And he uses a low budget palette to wrap his empty blanket around you as a bad memory. There's something so special about this damn thing. In a word, classically .... Also, if you watch 'Don't' first, then you will have some idea of ​​the crazy psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg's other movies. In short, they really don't come any more esoteric than this - well, actually they do, watch Brownrigg's 'Keep My Grave Open'. Mad genius. Do not accept any compensation.
