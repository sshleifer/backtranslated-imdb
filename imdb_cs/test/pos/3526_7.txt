Well, unfortunately, I can't help but feel a little disappointed after my, much, much anticipated "Just Before Dawn" viewing. Jeff Lieberman is an amazing filmmaker and can no doubt do big things with a small budget, but I was expecting to see a more sadistic and horrifying beginning of the 1980s. But I'm actually starting to think that Lieberman is not the one who's blamed for it, but WE gorehounds are! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to take his backwoods-slasher look like "Deliverance" and absolutely not as "Friday the 13th", which immensely popularized the sub genre a year earlier. The horror and constant threat of threats come not mainly from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the truly ominous and isolated Oregon forests where the film was taken. If the movie seems to be slow and unbalanced, it's just because Lieberman takes the time to introduce the dark forests and terrifying mountains as other characters in his film. We hardly ever see murderers in person, but they always seem to be tempted from behind trees or under mountain lakes. With this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a very admirable horror effort and actually much better than his current blood colleagues. In the midst of an almost endless selection of cruel and outrageous slasheres, Lieberman successfully puts emphasis on tension and character development. The plot revolves around twenty-five friends who go on vacation in the Oregon Forest, where one of them owns little land. The forests are abandoned and the campers, of course, ignore Roy's guard (George Kennedy!) To return to civilization. Shortly thereafter, they meet brutally with an inbred family whose sons have murderous tendencies. All five main characters are surprisingly sympathetic and convincing! No unpleasant stereotypes for which you don't feel compassion as much as girls or football athletes. As a result of this "natural" character, you will automatically cheer up for them, even if they will eventually turn into savages themselves. Noble camera-work adds to the film with an occasionally unbearable level of tension and Brad Fiedel's chilling electronic score just adds to this effect. "Just Before Dawn" is a fine piece of the 80's horror movie if you don't want your TV to drip.
