This review was written by someone who read it (several times) and knows what it is talking about! First I read the other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austens, or it depends on some good book, will know that sticking to a book is important, you have to trust the author with what they do. If the viewer does not like being well in the book, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and are clearly not a real fan. First, if the viewer really loves a book or Jane Austen in general, watching four hours shouldn't be difficult. Secondly, their company cared a lot about appearance and so big, fancy hairstyles would show you how rich you were, which was a key factor in your life to get into "good" society. I have to admit that the women's costumes were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad ones, and the men invented it, and these prejudices for naval men who are not in uniform are very stupid in nice words! with their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century. Also, as it goes, it is very good, it is subtle because it is, as Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. It is not possible to compare the shooting with the 1995 version because the technology has improved so that it is ridiculous to compare them. The actress who plays Ann is too old, but her acting and the way she does it does. People seem to prefer the 1995 version for a reason I can't understand! It does not stick to the book at all and so it is flat, the end is sentimental, it changes the main scenes, the only good actors are the leaders, and I did a good job for what was given to them. Obviously, people who really, really like them (sorry) are stupid because they don't understand persuasion and so they need it to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by an excellent screenwriter (as well as Inspector Morse), has a very good actor and is really a movie you can watch many times during which you can be happy with it.
