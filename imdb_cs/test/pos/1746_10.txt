Wow. I saw this movie and "Up" on the same day within one hour of each other in different theaters. At first I saw "Mr. Bug" and then I was completely disappointed by the follow-up "Up". What a beautiful and moving movie! Films of the 1930s and 1940s can be irritating to us today with their melodramatic acting and dialogue, but as an animation the same melodrama and moaning humor can be amazing. And the soft "organic" line of 30s drawings and music just gives you a pleasant, pleasant mood and you can enjoy a show with all the little characters: ladybugs, locusts, bees, snails, stinkbugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more with everyone own cute little (but not excessive) idiosyncrasies. Interactions with the human world, from the nemesis (cigar smokers, high heels, innocent kicks who play children) to the kind and unknown destroyers, are realistic and fascinating. You care about the mistakes, And Dick and Mary. Hoppity's protagonist is not the perfect superman to come to the "right thing", but the optimist who leads the starry eyes that lead everyone along the garden path (literally!) And every time you think it will end up happily in the 1930s, another one will come obstacle ...! I was on the edge of my chair much more than "Up". I came out of the cinema and smiled and smiled: something that didn't happen in a long time!
