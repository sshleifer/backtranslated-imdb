When I started watching "Surface" for the first time I was hooked. He had everything I wanted in the show of tension, action, secrets, great land, and great cast characters. My whole family loved watching the show. show, the network usually cancels it, as if it looked like this show. They go according to the Nielson rating system, which in my opinion is stupid because there are plenty of junk things that seem to be watching on which networks are still holding air. If there was just a way for everyone to vote on the show then maybe good shows won't be canceled.When I watch TV now I'm just watching good shows so right now it's not watching a whole range of TV.I hope the net will bring the show back but when they think that with a stupid decision they seem I keep it there. I hope there are a lot of people who feel the same way.
