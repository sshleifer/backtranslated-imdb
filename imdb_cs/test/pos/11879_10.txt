I can't see what's so bad about the movie. I loved this movie! I thought this movie was the best movie in the series. Although Part 3 is the best in the series, I still gave this movie 10 out of 10 because it's great. I don't see what this film hates. Who wouldn't want to see a little action. I wished Brad Brown would have come out of this because it might be a little better. Those who like a bit of drama because ... wait for me not to tell you, you'll have to watch it. This movie also includes some popular actors who are ... (I won't tell you because I hate it when people give spoilers so I don't want to be one of those people). Well, I think it's all I have to say about this movie.
