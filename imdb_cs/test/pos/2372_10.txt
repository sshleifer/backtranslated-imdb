Dead or Alive: Final, a film that allegedly combines three movies in a very loose trilogy, Dead or Alive, and is linked mainly to its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each film has its share of bizarre world preparations and neuroses and a pile of violence is undoubtedly the weakest of the series. That none of these three films end up disappointing is less evidence of material creativity, but a mere bush that Takashi Miike takes with his surroundings and material. Here, he is clearly a dystopian future, whether key, where a homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) has a whole village under the influence of a rebel group. Also in this year 2346 is a replicant - robots - one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot with total deadly ability, but also the ability to love and learn and so on. Then the Takihi (Takeiuchi) police officer becomes mayor's chief guard. But things are beginning to crumble on both sides, Ryo has teamed up with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, although blood-soaked accidents like bad hostages have gone wrong, and Takeshi found his wife and son are robots (they didn't make a mood, you think, just suddenly, as if in power, and that he is also one, and all this leads to the last inexplicable showdown between the two men. <br /> <br /> Strange there's another movie he has on Miike peaks and valleys, and sometimes find that science-fiction science is at the center of success, but there's nothing really out of this story except that the mayor / dictator is dingbat without a back story that has its rocks to He has made sure that his medication ceases to become pregnant and that everything remains under control.He also has along with him his slave of love, I would guess, in a cheerful non-speaking part of a saxophonist who also doubles sometimes as a human affiliate Meanwhile, we get conventional parties to the stories of Ry and Takeshi and are never uninteresting, just not entirely convincing to keep an interest. Of course, Miike has no fun like Takeshi plops Michelle (Maria Chen) into the water to swim her after attempting to assassinate the mayor, or saying that the original rebel leader speaks English no. good reason at all. At the beginning of the film there is also a playful tribute to the old sci-fi cartoons. But there's nothing very convincing about the fabric, except for Takeshi's tiny turn, when they become "good" in the middle of the movie (helping a couple to get a child's permission), and mostly Miike's forces are purely stylistic this time and choosing places and orchards . It is like an eccentric Japanese alfaville, where everything has its modern feel thanks to all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green Miike, which was used in the film, because it turned out very well for outdoor scenes and added just enough grittity to the indoor scenes. But in terms of peaks and valleys, we see this increasingly clear - and sci-fi movie channel visual effects level, with maybe a few more dollars in it - during the peak. This includes some of the most entertaining materials in the most challenging, Freudian sensitivity from the director, even if he has to start with an unbearable controversy; The way Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is somehow random and only for producers to try to cheaply tie the last two movies when it wasn't needed. On the other hand, as far as absolute guilt of the fun value of swing as Miike is, where one sees something totally unexpected and very roughly sexual, he ranks up there with the best scenes of Katakurs and Happiness Q. Total Dead or Alive: Final is a 90-minute effort that is not taken seriously by TOO, and is all the better for its malevolent controversy, militaristic decline and cultural hangout on display.
