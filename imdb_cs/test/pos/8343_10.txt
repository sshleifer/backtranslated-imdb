This film is about a teenager who struggles with his social status at school. He is a "good Christian" and feels he lacks all the fun in high school. So he wishes he would never become one. After getting his wish and trying for a secular lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has diminished dramatically and wants to go back to being a man he was. A good family oriented movie with a positive message that you are proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
