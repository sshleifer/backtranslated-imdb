There are so many episodes that make me scream over the stories <br /> <br /> that I wish I could choose the best, Rocko and Bill take care of a strange couple who are out of help but manage to sacrifice and BS their way out of a difficult time just drag Dan into their crime life. Canadians will notice a special joke for Toronto or the federal government, and because the CBC has addressed a really good show Frantics has said. Dan was part of it, the show was shooting at them, and in the episode "Umbrella Dan" the CBC poked them over the coals. When Dan says CBC would never lose taxpayers' money on a useless venture, Rocko enters the room and gives Dan back his Tape of Friday-Night with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was a flop and most people would they didn't get the joke if they didn't know the history of CBC to show that people weren't watching or jumping good shows that they were watching.
