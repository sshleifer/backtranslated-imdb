This story is an excellent story of two boys doing their best to get out of the drunk father's rude father. The "Lord of the Rings" star Elijah Wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. This film is one of the main reasons why I have not touched a single beer and will never be as long as I live. That might sound like a nerd, but I have to say that. It's a wonder why this isn't a classic American fairy tale.
