Kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more persuasive characters, a more realistic story, and perhaps even deeper in terms of political evocation. But then, most of them are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps one genuine British filmmaker will perform from the sixties, Watkins has done quite a few rarely seen movies that perfectly portray the spirit of the outer aesthetic world - a world of political prospects, social problems and government solutions. So his work is probably less "film" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their own artistic quality. And then, why shouldn't art be involved? Watkins Adventures. And he will succeed. You won't feel good about this. You don't feel happy. In fact, you really don't like the movie; is uncompromising, honest, direct, shameless; just in the face. You can't help you get angry, you can't resist letting the things you see touch you. That's what makes Watkins films so beneficial.
