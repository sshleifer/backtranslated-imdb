That was very good, except for the two things I mention at the end. The animation is great, emphasized by Nick Park and the brand name of exaggerated teeth and mouths from characters that make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was also spectacular. However, the best work of the film is a smart comedy that is woven around the world. This is another of these animated movies, in which there is so much to see and hear every picture that would require many views to capture all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the strange "Wallace" and his quiet and intelligent dog "Gromita". Along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something similar to how obsessive dog lovers were shown in the "Best of Show." My only complaints were two typical features of today's movies, animated or not: 1 - Let the clergyman in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - Let's overestimate the last action scene with a predictable result, but an exaggerated way. You aside, this is still a very funny movie that should give a lot of laughter to many people and the movie to enjoy several times.
