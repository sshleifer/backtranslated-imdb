With his re-publication of ADV Films, I had the first opportunity to watch "The Giant Majin" without deep cuts and harsh words from late night horror theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie! The sets are authentic, acting in muted and credible, and the giant Majin is majestic, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the soft touch fantasies (enchanting wood, charm of happiness, etc.) and the thought of God as a little less than "good." This film begged for a remake in the new century!
