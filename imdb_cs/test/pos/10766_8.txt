I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said it was "sick" so they couldn't watch him. I think if you realize his rated R then you'll be ready for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and acting is amazing. You can't be proud to appreciate it! It's basically a mother who does drugs and wants to cleanse, so she calls a very rich old friend and moves them to her farm and becomes crazy. I think it's a drama. I'm just so sick of people who don't like movies because of curse or nudity. This is the world we live in. Of course you are not satisfied if you do not see things like this movie. And it's rated R. So, it should tell you from the beginning that not all peachy happy rainbows. I liked it. I think you'll be too!
