This documentary about Bill Hicks 'life and comedy features Hicks' Revelations and other stand-up shows. It also includes interviews with fellow comics and people in the industry who knew him, as well as reporters and journalists who talked about how his political comment was brutal and brutal. I liked it very much. I've already seen "Revelations", but comedy clips have been getting refreshing. It's a nice comedy and documentary story that explains Hicks' popularity to non-fans and delights those who are already familiar with it. I rated it ten.
