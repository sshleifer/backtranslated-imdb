Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. The events of their lives separate them and one of them lives in the USA for many years. When she receives a phone call, it's clear she has to go back because there's a problem in the air. It is a film about friendship, mistakes and repetition of life. But also a film about darkness, pain and endurance. From nice young days of adolescence and gaming to disintegration, back to playing games. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. He plays emotions and that is quite right for the drama, but it does too much for me. That makes him too much tearjerker, losing a little bit of the quality he carries. It's still good, but it's not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 dragons ran on the field
