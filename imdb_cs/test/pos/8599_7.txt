Nothing is worse than the genocide of our world history. This film attempts to describe the horror that one family faces - a common narrative device - in Hiroshima's atomic bomb world. The most memorable parts are the graphic and sad images Hiroshima people face as a result of the war. However, the story is increasingly concerned with the impact on a particular group of people and how they cope with their lives; In other words, if you don't really care about them, the film is bored. It's hard not to worry about when the home family's homeland is destroyed. I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie because it says very little politically and honestly, it has not kept my interest in family issues.
