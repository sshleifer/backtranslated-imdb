I'm not a big music fan of the video. I think music videos take away personal feelings from a certain song. In other words, creative thinking comes out the window. Similarly, personal feelings aside by MJ, throw aside. This was the best music video ever. Just amazing. It was a movie. Yes, people were. Brilliant! You had amazing acting, amazing choreography and amazing singing. That was spectacular. Simply the storyline of a beautiful young lady who was dating a man, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price added a thing to the song and the video. MJ was MJ, enough to say. This song was for a video of what Jaguars are for cars. Topline, PERFECTO. Even better, we got a real MJ without thousands of facelifts. Although ironically enough, there were more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. People go on Youtube. Take 14 minutes. from your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this video really is.
