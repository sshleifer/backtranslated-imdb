Columbia Pictures Short Subject Unit has never had any illusions about producing 'Art' movies. They wanted to give movie exhibitors a little more for their money when they booked Columbia Picture in their theaters. This would double for The 3 Stooges. MEN IN BLACK (1934) came as close as any of their comedic shorts by winning an Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject, Comedy. Though it didn't win, it could be. It was good enough, and even those who do not number among Stooge's files still seem to be won by a scream "....... calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" This was the second entry in a long series of comedy shorts created by Stooges for producer Jules White, head of the Columbia Short Course Department. Only ladies' hats, described in their credits as a "musical novelty", preceded him at Harry Cohen's Poverty Row. The film begins in Dr. Burton's office. Graves, head of hospital. He gets new trainees and mentions that three of them are being transferred from Medical Conditionally because they have stayed there for so long. But a good doctor says he won't reveal his identity until they promise all their "...... for duty and humanity!" The Stoogs run forward, promising "... for Duty and Humanity!", And running out of the office, breaking the door window. The game was on. The Stoogs took off and did not stop at the rest of the 2 cylinders. Every type of gag was proof. From wide Sennett-like gags, to puns, to humor dialects, to the 'absurd theater' and Surrealist run gag involving a public radio system that ostensibly takes the life of its own and have the right culprit, the radio tube get shot on ".. ...... he got me! " (It all plays pretty well, honestly!) The sets used were very authentic and were undoubtedly borrowed from the Columbia functions that were produced at the same time. There are plenty of chairs for bicycles, surgical cottons, stethascopes, rock scalpels, etc. that prove the hospital's illusion. The real strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of usually nameless players we all know by face. Along with them, the film boasts a large number of veteran actors who always play fine performances, often stealing the scene. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shone in small parts. Finally, we have Maestro, director Raymond McCarey, brother of Leo McCarey's children, who showed off his ability to get this little 'can' movie. Skilfully keeping it moving, he occasionally acted as a traffic cop, with all the actors, extras and backstage crews moving outside. And it doesn't count Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle, The Sway Backed Horse and Miniature Race Cars, not to mention "Giant, Green Canaries".
