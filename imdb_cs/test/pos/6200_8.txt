Sleeper Cell is what was supposed to be 24. 24 is a cartoon. (I look at 24, but I feel cheated by every stupid episode, all four or five seasons. Who can watch them all the same. Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately returns to trouble. The Sleeper Cell is really well done and much better. Unfortunately, they threw it out at the end of the second season. I can think of half a dozen better endings from the top of my head that would work better for his clear goals and not be so strong. Shame on the writer for not having been to the end, a really good series.
