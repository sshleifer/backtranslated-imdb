No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. It's not a good movie. But it's an average movie with some good effects and a convincing story (and of course, Mathilda May). In fact, it may be one of my favorite SF / horror movies for the very simple reason that they are trying to think their way through the science of space vampires. How often do you see it? Even in the "Alien" (SF / Horror Swing of All Time) science did not come into the story at all. In "Lifeforce," she tries to make a reason for the disproportionate world. <br /> <br /> I think it's successful? No. I think the film has a problem with a massive set of casts that Hooper is trying to gather on the track and that viewers need to focus on more than one "villian" and there are too many trips. > <br /> To be honest, the film is a feast for the eyes and fun to watch. But there is a great potential for a better remake that would take care of what Hooper was trying to do, and actually create a strong, scary, SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> If this is the case, I ask Mathilda May to have a portrait.
