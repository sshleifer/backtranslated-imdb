"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" era. In the meantime, Hal Roach Studios began to hit their step in making talking pictures, and "Shakespeare" is a happy result. The gang appears in the version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy's wife Copa. Children will not find a game that is fun to be in the theater, and people who are distracted by the theater will not remember their lines. The most fun pieces are Kennedy Cop as a giant who takes off his make-up to fight an exaggerated man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by Bob McGowan's daughter.) Several filmographies say "Shakespeare" has the first pie fight in the talkie. This may be true when they saw how they tried different speeds during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the cakes. Very funny and early Gang talkie classic. 9 of 10.
