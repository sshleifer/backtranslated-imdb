I thought I was wasting my expensive 50 bucks to watch this movie. But on the serious request of my friend, who is a keen fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to film. Going to this cheap theater really bothered me because I saw King Kong for $ 50 at one of the city's best theaters. The movie starts and I didn't start to complain. Great story and some amazing fabulous performances for Shaban Azmi and Konkon Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi is a divorce who dedicated her life to the welfare of her mother and sister. Konkona Sen Sharma schizophrenic (saving me with spelling) that she has been imagining all along. Rahul Bose also gives stellar performance. The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after she has been brutally raped on her field work as a reporter, her levels are increasing, her fiancé leaves her, for the person with whom she happened. It turns out all over the world. Shabana Azmi, her older sister, cares for her, and Mithi believes in her imagination that she was married to her fiancée, has 5 children, and stays in 15th Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York). The story goes on as Mithi becomes suicidal because she believes no one believes her and she is captured in her house by her husband. As fate should, Mithi and her fiancée will meet when they are both on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiancée has no existence in her real world, she cannot recognize it. Her fiancée, now married and the father of two children, feels it is his duty to correct the mistake he made 11 years ago and promises to take her to Park Avenue. and does. He takes her to a place in Calcutta, which is said to be her husband's home. As Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), her fiancée talks on her cell phone that loses track of Mithi. Everyone is looking for her, but she is nowhere to be found. Finally, she gets what she was denied to her family, her own imaginative family in her own world on Park 15. \ t I must say that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of Aparna Sen's direction. Working with the camera is excellent. And performance quality is a magic boundary. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a solid performance as a schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another role to evolve as a senior divorce sister in charge of keeping her family. Rahul Bose, another neat and calm role (I don't know why the guy doesn't get a big break, he has so many options). Finally, Aparna Sen, still attracts the audience, even though he is not in front of and behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Well deserved ...
