IMAGINARY HEROES is one fine little movie! This story, written and directed by Dan Harris, is so tight with classic theater, weaving comedy and tragedy that the climax of the film will take your breath away. The Travis family is an odd group: no member is who everyone seems to be. Father Ben (Jeff Daniels), who begins with the suicide of a reluctant "hero" child champion Matt (Kip Pardue), breaks up and isolates himself from his family and himself, while mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns to sweat and fury. sarcasm, Penny's daughter (Michelle Williams) returns from school repelled by her family's behavior, and the remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the onslaught of all of the above by avoiding her classmates, girlfriend and teams with her neighbor Kyle (Ryan). Donow) jump into drugs and sexual experimentation. Throughout the film Tim tries to hide the bruises on his body that have the secrets of his own, but lead his girlfriend to feel refused, his mother angry against a trailer trailer garbage bully she believes is the cause, and finally open the window to the depth of the scar, which this family suffers for years. Secrets and lies, here, and their solution is painfully dramatic. This may be Sigourney Weaver's best role, although Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the brevity of his role) all contribute top performances. The story begins slowly and seems to be spinning, and this fact may lose viewers' attention, but stun with the small powerhouse film and the impact of the work. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
