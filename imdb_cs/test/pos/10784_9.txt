WOW, a masterpiece of a movie that is not to be missed. I had no idea what the movie was when I started watching it late at night. I didn't find it was Stone after the movie when I went to IMDb. I watched it and I was fascinated. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian, is simply superb. One of the best scenarios and working with the camera ... The film pulled me in and let me get to the very end ... I dared not blink for fear of missing something ... Amazing how small the budget can be and engrossing and Well done while huge budget movies that have a lot of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring. Don't miss this movie ...
