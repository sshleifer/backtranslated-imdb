For a long time I, a fan of the TV series The Monkees, refused to watch "Head" because it wasn't about the TV show characters who were warm and wonderful. "Head", instead, was said to be a cynical, dark movie. Finally, curiosity made me cave. Of course, I didn't find a new episode for a TV show, but a fascinating movie that addresses my dark side. I've always been fascinated by dreams and "Head" was very similar to watching someone else's dream, with incomplete tales of stories and little detail at the end of a scene that caused the film to reflect in a new direction , in a dream of consciousness. Incomplete stories really make my imagination wild, over and over again! The film also presents a very imaginative, beautiful cinematography, whose appearance is a black-and-white, white-black appearance. "Dad is a song". The music is scary, especially the lush arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is my dark side favorite song while my bright side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".) Finally, I think the TV series could use some of "heads" drama, intrigue and intensity. However, "head" could use some of the TV feel, humor and friendship.
