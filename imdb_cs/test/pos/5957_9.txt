I saw the movie last night and I have to say I loved it every minute. Taking the parody of Bond-esquire, it's really better. The film's real comedy is in its obvious disrespect for political correctness. Misogyny, cultural insensitivity and almost laughter of macho-ism films of this genre are used for major comic effects. It also calls the illogical and formal elements of the task, with the OSS 117 agent constantly learning difficult things insanely quick (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically evident clues. Some lines from the movie let me laugh for hours after the movie was finished ... and I must say that I learned something ... interesting ... a French vocabulary that would make me quite angry with the professors, I was to use . All in all, I thought this movie was excellent. The intensely witty and first-ever movie I've ever seen parodies all aspects of the spy movie.
