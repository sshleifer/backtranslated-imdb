All right, I'm 12, so this is where you can watch a movie from a pre-birth perspective. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great movies if you want to check it out. Well, here on Earth was a beautiful movie with amazing scenes and pictures, very eye-catching. The writer (I don't know who it was, check the IMDB) either worked very hard, or has good appreciation for love, poetry and drama. I shouted 4 times in this movie, once in more than 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. It's a great movie for everyone, say, 11 and up, which is not a romantic comedy. Yeah, it's romantic, yeah, it's comic, but (in my opinion) it's better than "she's all that's" or "what's it". I never cry! It's a tender story. Go rent and tape it :).
