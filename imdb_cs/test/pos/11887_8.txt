This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Many reviews seem to be lacking in the fact that the comedy is based on a rather subtle time (sometimes right in the face) contrast between old and new China. For example, Kara Hui is called the bumpkin of the country and gets in trouble whenever she tries to adapt to a new one, but eventually to save her family honoring her dress as an old-fashioned heroine unlike the modern military style of Hsiao Ho. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part in the laughter he played with his serious monk figure with silly wigs and guitar. The end of the fight is just fantastic and ends up defeating rather than Johnny Wang than death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great thief game with 'invincible armor' - just amazing. And Kara Hui does some wonderful playing and fighting. Great movie.
