In some scenes in Rain People, ancestor of Francis Ford Coppola to his hey-day of the 1970s, there is a mark of similar situation to 1969's easy rider, but not exactly in the same reference frame. Here we have a drama about disconnected people from society, in some respects stolen by elections or limits set by one or the other way. It is one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand as a total knockout. Even with such a low budget and a very idle approach to filming, Coppola is able to capture all that needs to be expressed through these clearly defined characters and curved, unexpected degrees of one character. helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. And how could one incline to the very fact of what is in the suburban life of the 1960s, the leak of the film he mentioned earlier, but more specific, is almost timeless with drama and basic issues . . In a way, if Bergman was on his way as a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday outsiders, it could be it. But with all the very straightforward and sometimes self-conscious photos (though with an occasional documentary approach, similar to their uncertain characters), all the actors fit into place. Shirley Knight, an actress I am not very familiar with, has a complicated, different role when a pregnant woman runs away in some existentialist destruction of her life. There are times when one of them is inspired by her, and one of my favorite (if not my favorite) is when she is first on the phone and calling her husband. Such a tense scene at both ends and in every small gesture and inflection of the word so much is spoken so little. It is an exceptional way of reflecting others in Coppola's films. Then comes the character "killer" who plays James Caan. It is also a dangerous figure to be accepted because it is a mixture of childish confusion and fun with scarred memories. Think Forrest Gump if it doesn't do around football and wit. It's one of his best, actually, it's the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays hard guys in movies, here's the one that's also part of the story's core and knight's character. Also very good in the supporting role is Robert Duvall as a rough-faced cop and a rather diverse past; a kind of earlier sample of other defective characters that he would later play in his career. So the characters and what Coppola risks running uneasiness are really what makes the movie, however the story there is definitely not resolved in the usual way you can think or expect. For the last ten minutes, like the rest of Coppola's work, where specific tragedies on all sides are undermined by the emotional and psychological consequences they leave behind on the principles, they are amplified to noble and sad. This is for his time brave in what he is trying to be represented (both in freedom and in ambiguities and ambiguities) in the subject. And the picture style adds a fragmented look to everything with fast flashes that are graphical and separate in contrast to longer shots in some key scenes. It is a road movie of its time, but it was also a lot more work than it would do under another filmmaker with fewer chances to take on the nature of these outcast characters. One of the best films of 1969.
