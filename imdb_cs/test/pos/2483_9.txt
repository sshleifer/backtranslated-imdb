This extraordinary pseudo-documentary film, created in 1971, perfectly captures the present-day American zeitgeists, making it more frightening and relevant. "Subversives" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are to be rounded by the government and given a lengthy prison term for what amount to thinking crimes and social protest. As an alternative to prison life, these "criminals" are offered three days in a "criminal park". Their goal in the park is to embark on an American flag where freedom is waiting for them. No wonder Park Punishment is a dirty lie. This great movie by Peter Watkins even precedes the data of "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although his attack angle is obviously more political. Fired in '71, he looks and feels as fresh as anything he does today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is sharp. The story moves between different groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and McCarthy's trials that have condemned them. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71 there was nothing but nothing. This is a masterpiece that succeeds a dozen levels. She has balls that most people have lost today.
