This is one of my favorite childhood movies. At the turn of the century, located in a remote wilderness of Siberia, a small village is stirred up when extremely cold winters make two tigers come from the mountains in search of food and hunt on remote farms. In this atmosphere, we are familiar with Avakum, a hermit fur-hunter who lives in the wild when he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his loved one, rather the only friend in the village who runs the shop. At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanies his friend's arrogant son, Ivan, in pursuit of the menacing tigers. Personalities of the crash and seductive eruptions, because the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, encounters recorded by other hunting members. The next day the hunters will see their prey and chase. In the dense forest, Ivan hurt one of the tigers, who then attacks an unhappy man. Avakum, when he saw Ivan tangled with the angry beast, fired, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills the tiger when he runs away. The other hunters come to the scene, suspiciously. <br /> <br /> In the village, the doctor is trying to save Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village but is confronted with Ivan's friends. But the shepherd blows them away and stops with his dog sleds. Young villagers swear to come to him if Ivan dies, which he later does, but before dying, he tells his father it was an accident. Old Boris, when he found out that his close friend from the village was running away, was straightening up the assembly of the "lynch crowd" and following Avakum to find him and fix things. And so the main story begins. A simple film that raises human conflict and civilization versus nature, especially the struggle of Avakum to survive alone in the wild. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element of the film is the soundtrack of Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme reminiscent of Albinoni's Adagio. Other movements reflect Russian styles as well as several folk music songs. Unfortunately, this movie is not available to buy, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. The copy he owns, recorded off the television almost twenty years ago, is slowly deteriorating. This film needs to be seen for those who appreciate it if they find it. 8/10
