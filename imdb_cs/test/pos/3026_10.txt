"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip not only to the massive mind of a serial killer, but also to one of the talented directors. This is a convincing proof of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their unlimited ideas. That's boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and clich√©s to create something really spectacular. This is the best film of the year to date. <br /> <br /> I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all styles and no stuff to badly cast characters and bad play. To negatively criticize this film is to miss it. This film can be a milestone, a tradition in which future films will hope. "The Cell" just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door to his face and tell her and her director Tars Singh that we no longer want more? Personally, I would like more than another Tars movie and would like to see someone trying to attack him. We've all heard talk about how to go into the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a little overworked. The 1990s were full of movies that attempted to describe what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked but failed most. But "The Cell" does not shine the same footprint, we get a new twist, we are physically transported to the mind and presented with nothing but the fascinating path of the most mysterious subject he ever studied. I like the way the movie does not release us with an overly scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets into the brain of another. Instead, he just lays on his lab table and is wrapped in what looks like really long Twizzlers and meets another entity. "The Cell" wants you to "see" what it's all about, not "how" it's all, and I think that's what some people don't like. It is true that I like the explanations of my films, but when the film sets out on new ground, you have to do what it wants and simply take it. I noticed that the movie was very dark when it was revealed reality, maybe to contrast with the bright visuals when it was in the brain of the other. However, the design of the set was simply overwhelming. I would not be surprised if this film took home several Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, the best director and so on. If it were up to me, at least they would nominate me for the best picture. I noticed that I was repeating myself. Not because there was nothing to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought "The Cell". If you enter a movie with a very open mind and take miracles and a charming feast, you will be sure that you have a good time. I think this movie was too much for some people, he wrote it as "weird" or "crazy". I am a lot in the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was right down the aisle. I left the theater and heard that one viewer said, "Whoever did the movie did a lot of good medicines." If so, I want what he smoked. <br /> <br /> **** (of 4)
