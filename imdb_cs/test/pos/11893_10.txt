I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be fun. Direction, playing and story is brilliant. Certainly there with movies like scarface and godfatherThis movie is your heart race.Damian Chap as well as all cast was awesome. I would definitely rent this movie. American Chapa deserves an academic award for his acting performances and the way he portrayed a gangster's life. This movie is an early classic and ubiquitous film -making. I loved it and gave it 10 stars. Watch this movie and see what I mean. 2 inches up !!!!!!!
