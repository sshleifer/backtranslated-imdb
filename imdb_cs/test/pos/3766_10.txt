He came from a "druggie" generation, I thought this movie was fun. Jekyll & Hyde definitely did, so to speak. My husband and I laughed with him all the way. I'd like to have a movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and would like to see it. They're not drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the film's comedy. It's been so long since I saw that I can't remember but a few things. I would have to say that the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll set off on a lab table and inhaled straw while snoring, and then snorted the powder drug he had invented. The funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
