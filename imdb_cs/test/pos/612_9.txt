Sadness and nostalgia penetrate late chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, is now undergoing a retrospective of his long inaccessible films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on the three stories of Fumiko Hayashi, late chrysanthemums tell the story of four retired geishas, ​​now middle-aged, whose lives are full of disappointment and regret. The performance is uniformly outstanding, particularly that of Haruko Sugimura, who played in Ozu's films Springtime, Floating Weeds, and Tokyo's story among others. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with his young maid who is unable to speak. It becomes cynical to men and has turned its attention to money, especially to real estate speculation. and lend money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishas. Kina's friends live in poor circumstances and complain about how Kin became greedy and Tomi spends considerable time playing to try and fulfill. Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children. Tamae's son goes to work for coal mines in Hokkaido and Tomi's daughter decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. They both resist changes in their circumstances, but they accept it as inevitable. Two friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom she once considered double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover is looking forward to seeing her again after many years. Her mood is positive, but soon she turns to resentment when she finds out that both men are only interested in lending money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences smoothly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae are fleeing each other by losing their children Dialogue is extremely natural, and characters are women of power that, while their future does not seem clear, refuse to see themselves as victims. Late chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in Ozu's movies and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow transition of time and comfort that memory and society can bring the way.
