Amazingly rough account of two soldiers found in World War II. This film, built against the frosty background not only of the struggle against Nazis and traitors in Belarus, but also of the cruel natural elements, tells the story of two soldiers of polarized morals who survive, but it is somewhat impossible to deal with it. The actual circumstances and the person who dies have done everything that can be done in the face of intimidation and all sorts of possibilities to break the spirit, in fact the "followers" of the title. A film that should be seen by all, especially for the phenomenal presentation of the main characters, and the shaking pieces (especially the imprisonment and hanging of the scenes. The absolute must see.
