I especially liked the end of this film - I really felt what the characters had to feel, which in my opinion is a sign of good leadership. I was tickled as the new rental in the record store showed - great character development there, though its "role" would probably be considered small. I was also impressed that the whole film, while dark in its subject, was free from gratuitous nudity, profanity, and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all (often better) be conveyed by what is left unexpressed, but it often appears to be unique for truly "primitive" movies and actors. Kudos to film-for it.
