William H. Macy is amazing in this Alfred Hitchcock movie. Macy plays as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The characters that follow are cheerful. James Cromwell gives amazing performance as a private detective blackmail. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives phenomenal performance. Look at this movie whenever it is at t.v and check your video stores because that's the one you don't want to miss.
