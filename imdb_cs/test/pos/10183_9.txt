Carefully designed and perfectly played, at the end of the Earth is simply an amazing journey from our reality and to another age. Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films capture the journey to both Australia and the experience of the young aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging men's war in the early 19th century as he heads down Under. Among the crew members and hopeful emigrants are his passage is a tumultuous, bullying captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a canyon's first lieutenant, who has gone from the bottom (Jamie Sives) and fleeing the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page), whose boat literally goes through the night. In addition to the amazing level of physical historical accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have an eye eye and are for the behavior and rigid etiquette of earlier times, creating a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. Life on the ship is one brutal, monotonous round of sea sickness, misery and danger after another, and as Edmund becomes entangled in the love, hope and suffering of his fellow travelers, he experiences a fearsome faith of life difficulties, the inhumanity of man and his noblest feelings. Those who enjoyed Master and Commander: on the other side of the world or a series of Patrick O'Brian's novels on which it was founded will love it? for all the others it is discovering a new world.
