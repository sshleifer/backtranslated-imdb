*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (of four) <br /> <br /> "You believe he is part of you, deep inside your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During the session, when I'm inside, I see these things. "Catherine Deane" And so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a film of love / hate - either you love it or you hate it. I understand the reasons why some people do not want this production. With a story that combines intrusive serial killers with mind-probing, "cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the most interesting movies this year. Mark Protosevich creates his feature film script and creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. Filmmakers use every shot. Protosevich conceived the ideas of "The Cell" in 1993, when he decided to combine two of his main interests, mind-probing and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such imagination. The film combines two main stories, one about the scientific research of the human mind and the other about the psychopath who murdered young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a pediatrician, is part of a neurological study at Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her empathetic personality, scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen in the hope of reviving his brain to awakening. Sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. In an abandoned country estate, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes the FBI every time he approaches, until now. A violent attack makes him comatose. The FBI captures his forever unconscious body. Unfortunately, he has already prepared a cell with his last victim. In forty hours, the cell is filled with water, and Stargher is the only person who knows the position of his victim. The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind. hoping to find his last victim's place before the cell fills with water, send the woman to the water grave. The science fiction part of the story relied on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of a system of neurological cartography and synaptic transmission. The project has been developing for a long time, but it is worth waiting. That's far drawn, but it doesn't matter. The film convinces us. Even if you do not stop mistrust, visual enthusiasm provides an engaging environment to enjoy. According to film production notes, Mark Protosevich was excited to work with a director named Tarsem because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning artistic direction and highly developed storytelling skills. "When I wrote" The Cell, "explains Protosevich," I surrounded myself with postcards or colorful copies of paintings or photographs when I was working. So I thought visually and Tarsem is a very visual director. Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone and none of the actors could finish his character, adding a mysterious, disturbing and engaging performance. "I think my character is trapped in a way," he says D'Onofrio, he also examined the serial killers' psychology to help him get under the surface of his character, while his thorough preparation pays off nicely. Backstage Talent of the Film Paul Laufer, Production Designer Tom Foden, Costume Designer April Napier, Special Effects Coordinator C lay Pinney and visual effects manager Kevin Tod Haug bring the world of "cell" life, it's an extraordinary world worthy of a few glances. Some of the movies you watch, others you are experiencing. "The Cell" falls into a later category. <br /> <br />
