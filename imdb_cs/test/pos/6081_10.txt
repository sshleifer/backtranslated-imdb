A wide and deeply moving love story with the performances of Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. It tells the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who pulls out of an airplane that over the years World War II and tells his sister (Juliette Binoche) his story. Just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), but she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth) and the two start a passionate and forbidden business. Very haunted and tragic story of love and desire built against some absolutely beautiful places in the desert. Must be seen, especially if your fan Anthony Minghellas work, but be prepared to shed a lot of tears that are very moving, especially at the end.
