Michael Radford did a great job that brought this difficult game to the screen. He took a game of anti-Semitism and showed us that Shakespeare knew well about the humanity of the Jews. Radford said after the screening and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be led by driving, a compulsive need for revenge. He also points out quite rightly that a man who was anti-Semitic could not write Shylock's speech: "If you stab me, do I not bleed?" no character is free of defects; No character is bad. Radford placed the game in the 16th century, which gives the exuberant background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project the Shakespeare lyrics. If you get a chance to hear Radford talk about the movie, I highly recommend that you take it because it details the life in Venice of the 16th century that sheds light on the many choices it has made and provide considerable depth of observation. I hope the DVD comes out with extensive commentary. Jeremy Irons makes a magnificent view of Antonio, a man who gives up the burden of his past offenses. Lynn Collins, a relative of unknown, gives us absolutely flawless, stunning and detailed work like Portia. Not only is Mrs. Collins beautiful, but she also gives Portia a layer of intelligence and humor in front of a test scene that I seldom saw in any production of the game. the rest of the cast also does amazing work, with the remarkable performance of Kris Marshall as Gratiano, and the beautifully fine work of Allan Cordun as Tubal, playing foil to Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino takes his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and says no words, but you can see all the emotions and insanities that flow into him and stand out as he perceives. his happiness is changing. <br /> <br /> If you like period films, I can't recommend this movie enough.
