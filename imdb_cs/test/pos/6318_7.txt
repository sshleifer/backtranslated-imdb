One of the most important quotes from the whole film is pronounced in the middle by the protagonist, the mafia middle man Titti Di Girolam, a middle-aged physically unidentified man from Salerno in southern Italy. When we met him at the beginning of the film, he lives in the environment in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland for the last ten years. . While this pivotal yet apparently remarkable scene takes place, employees of the Swiss bank, which normally calculates the cash of Di Girolam, tells him that his usual trunk of stacked banknotes is missing $ 10,000. In the news silently, but icyly threatens his manager who wants to close his account. In the meantime, he tells us, the audience, that when you bluff you have to bluff to the end without worrying about being caught or looking ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then tell the truth in half. After I did it - bluffing only halfway and telling the truth, and when I accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is exactly why Titty Di Girolamo's problems started. This initially unsympathetic character, a frowning, silent, shortened man on the verge of 50 years, a man who will not even answer in kind to the maids and waitresses who greet and farewell become someone in the same place the viewer is deeply interested. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern appearing "ridiculous". The first half of the film can be described as "slow" by some. It's really revealing Di Girolamo's days and nights at this hotel a strangely separate, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that seem unnecessary reveal the importance of how this masterfully designed and innovative film unfolds. Existence of Titta Di Girolamo - a person without imagination, identity or life, unsympathetic character who unexpectedly ends up loving and feeling the least you think - is also mediated by elegantly modified sequences and very interesting use of music (one in particular Scottish theme Boards of Canada There has never been a contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat gangsters more than they have made films like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is not unlike Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, Al Pacino Insomnia), this condition, to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise that has been so deeply drawn into the unknown unconscious, is almost impossible. its cause (if there really is one). <br /> <br /> Young and sympathetic Sofia's waitress (played by Olivia Magnani, legendary Anna's granddaughter), and the memory of Titty's best friend, a man he hasn't seen in twenty years, unexpectedly giving a small life window that Titta (though preliminarily) initially accepts to look at again. Although it is never explicitly stated, the viewer knows that for a person like Titta, the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and does not allow the viewer any expectations, is a great representative of the small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that takes place in Cinoittà during the second the mid-1970s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-movies in style ... neglect to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and more.
