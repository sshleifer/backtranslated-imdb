I own this movie and I love Canadian movies, but I hire an actress like Rose I don't understand. It's absolutely useless in this movie, just a name that's all. The rest of the cast is good, good enough to make this little thriller Surprise me a plot that wasn't the first time it was used. But those unfamiliar actors did well with Jergen too, I'm not a big fan of him, but I liked him in this movie. see it go for it.
