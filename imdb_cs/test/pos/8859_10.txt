John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving him the greatest respect he could, the only difference is that Carpenter decides to stick to the paranoid core of John W Campbell Jr.'s story. The secret to the success of this version is the unbearable tension that builds up when a group of men become suspicious, and the tension literally awaiting takeover is afraid. The carpenter manages to deliver shocks, as well as the secrets needed to direct the film in the right direction. Whether it's a scary scene or "what's in the shadows", the film is a perfect blend of horror and science fiction for me. The dialogue is in place for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's score is an amazing spooky pulse rhythm that further develops a sense of doom and paranoia seams through the film. The cast is an excellent, solid gathering of actors headed by the carpentry love of Kurt Russell, while the applied effects give the right range of impact needed. But most of all it is the end that is the coronation fame, the end that does not bother the norm and is incredibly suitable for what happened before, lets wait and see what really happens, 10/10.
