This movie is pretty sad and sad, I think it's true. If you like Office Space, then you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it's nothing like Office Space. I told everyone to see this movie. I just wish it was in more theaters so it would get the credit she deserved. I love this movie and would like to see more from Judge Mike. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie. I'm so glad I won't be alive in 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true, we're all in a lot of trouble. I just hope that more people will see this movie because I know they will also fall in love with it.
