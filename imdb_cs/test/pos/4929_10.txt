This was one of my favorite childhood movies. I watched it so many times until my tape expired. I was a huge fan of this show and I'm still. The thing I love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, young and old. I look at this movie and laugh as hard as I first saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes I have never received as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (also a big movie fan) and I still quote lines from this movie. I like the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You save your seats, Shirl and I will catch a dadgum snack." I also loved the story of Plucky and Hampton and his family who go to Earth of the Happy World. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my father. I love that part of it when they finally reach the Earth of the happy world and all they do is ride a monorail. This film is cheerful and appeals to children and children. Animations, jokes and all about it are excellent. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You will not regret.
