This movie is just beautiful. It's as funny as hell and as old as the hills. Acting is excellent and fascinating to see post-war Britain and how we behaved these days. It seems that it was some preliminary series of St. Trinians (due to the association of Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole who has appeared in many St Trinians movies), but I myself do not understand the connection. It was shown on BBC4 recently after the biography of St Trinians creator Ronald Searle, however I lacked enough biography to miss the connection with this film. Anyway a great movie in itself and something that should be preserved all the time!
