Let's get one thing straight, it gets 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the wrong movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent out deliberately, where you go deliberately knowing it's a horrible knockoff and shun'd by everyone else. I went with one promise from the movie that there will be snakes on the train, and that brings! Gore itself is really good and the characters have amazing roles. Come on, he's got everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls who are drug traffickers. You see some topless nudity, blasts, snakes, gore and mexican main lines running after healing his girlfriend by hitting the cracks and blowing smoke in the face !! As I mentioned and many others have, movie stimulation is a bit gone, but still decent. Movies like this keep our group tradition joining together and all the chipping in grandma or two to watch works like this. There can't be a better time spent then come together to enjoy a good bad movie. It could learn something or two of those similar subtle moves like Alien Lock-down or Boa vs. Python, but these are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Fixed 7 out of 10.
