"Woman Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in a row, is a wonderful piece of sleaze pulp. Closer in tone and subject to Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion records, it is immensely photographed, directed with enthusiastic enthusiasm and populated by the villainous gallery of villains and degenerate. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns to this surrealistic fable, which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting his arm from a policewoman with which she is bound, and runs to the Tokyo subway where she is still swinging from her wrist. She takes refuge in the red light of the district where she befriends a prostitute, who is first seen seen having an incestous intercourse with her brother (who ends up impregnating her). Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually reveals her identity and all hell is released. She is defeated, sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in a robber's den. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally moving movie. It is excellent from the first three Scorpion films and represents one great scene after another. I can't recommend it.
