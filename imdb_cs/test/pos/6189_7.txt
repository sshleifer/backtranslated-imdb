The Sleeper Cell is trying to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans), not even very well. I postponed watching this show for a very long time because I felt it was too predictable, but after a year in my netflix line, I finally moved to the front. The show is about a secret Muslim man who works for the FBI in an attempt to penetrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The secret agent in the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / solution between his patriotism and his religious belief. Personally, I would rather watch a drama about an American Muslim family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an American television channel (cable or network) will sometimes produce something that would represent a flattering light to Muslims. I'm not a Muslim, but I have a lot of Muslim American friends and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and everyone loves America. The sleeping cell is approaching busting stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see "honor killings", a very poor depiction of Islam, but in the third episode we see a highly respected moderate Muslim scholar who teaches the viewer that real jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant. to encourage violence against others. If only the scholar of moderate Muslim thinking were the main character of the performance. Americans must learn much more about Islam, help the Sleeper Cell somewhat, but it comes far far away to give American viewers what it really needs to know. That means playing in this show is great, and the drama is extremely exciting. If this show about Islam in America were done without terrorism alone, it would be the first speed.
