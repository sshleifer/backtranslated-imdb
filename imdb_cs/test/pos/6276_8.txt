A jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about Jewish experiences in the United States. Apart from Crossfire (1947) and Gentlemen's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they usually had musical and theatrical backgrounds. These films included Jolson's Story (1946), Jolson Singing Again (1949), Eddy Duchin's Story (1951), Eddie Cantor's Story (1953), Benny Goodman's Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). Leading actors in these "Jewish" films have always played non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks non-Jew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme tangible mainly to non-Jewish audiences. Jazz singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic, and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish, even though she was playing a non-entering Jew. The key to her background is when she attends the Golding family before joining the family when she said: â€œSince I left home, I was not sad (Pesach service). The film is about the son of a son who just left the service after seeing the action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to sing in a musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. But there is much more to this film than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg test during McCarthy's whitchhunt and Hollywood blacklist. Therefore, in this film, Jews are shown as good faithful citizens and are quintessentialy Americans. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The cantor's friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is the major referee of the league. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington has reportedly visited it. Therefore, Jews are presented as an integral part of American society. Nobody in this film has the accent of Eastern Europe. Peggy Lee appeared in a very small number of feature films. In this movie you will see her singing "Lover" and "Just one of those things" wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite trustworthy and performs very well and sings. Comedy routines could be omitted. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental, but it's worth seeing. I liked it too much.
