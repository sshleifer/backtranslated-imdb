Over the past 30 years, there have been many attempts to create a film that has a "different world" look. Suppose this is a film director's desire to distance himself from other films, or simply hide a low-budget and shabby look, "Begotten" is at the top of this pile. Apart from the reckless "Eraserhead" anyway. Merhige's rigorous process of artificial humiliation of his film changes his structure completely (imagine what this movie would look like in a famous, standard Technicolor) - almost as if it were an artifact from another unknown culture. Some of the images are so far from what we expect to appear on the screen, they are mainly disturbed by their dislocation. This is not a violation of the "Last House on the Left", but rather that you leave your cave-for-first-time-and-see-sun-breakdowns. <br /> <br /> Watch this Fever-Dream if you get a chance and please. Remember, they do other, more standard movies every day. They can wait.
