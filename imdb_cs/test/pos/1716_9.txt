Russell T Davies has the task of re-creating a piece of my childhood: hiding behind the sofa and watching the scary monsters fighting Dr Who. He and his crew are clearly all committed to the original series. Like Star Trek movies used their budget to make Gene Rodenberry's original concept more credible, Russell T Davies has both the money and the benefits of excellent CGI to create the best monsters ever. I'm sure this series was made with a budget that assumed both export and DVD sales, and it really feels like no costs were saved. <br /> <br /> Dr. an episode that is really useful behind the scenes. Interviews with actors and writers help reformulate the story from the point of view of each character and are more useful than simply watching the entire program again. How does David Tenant rank in the pantheon of his predecessors? Time will tell, but tonight, when Billie Piper plays alongside Elisabeth Sladen, who was an accompanying physician in the 1970s, confirms she has acting ability, presence on screen, and script first.
