This movie is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when movies just fun and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely a "good thing" as Martha Stewart would say (right)! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing to this film and Dennis Morgan praises her perfectly. Both have magic and warmth. They are assisted by the crew of the incredible actors who seemed to have disappeared from the 40s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor. Where are these characters today? Neither role could be better. Fortunately, Bette Davis rejected this role as under her and had the right to refuse her. She would try to park on everyone and everything around her and destroy the film completely. Stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play it easily. She was rarely more attractive and perfect. Morgan is the essence of a nice guy. Because its part is the smallest, there is a tendency to overlook its ability. The fact that he could stick to himself, surrounded by such different personalities, is in itself a success, but he is also absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones. Skip the poorly advised (and useless) 1992 remake and watch this bright, sparkling holiday gift!
