This movie is about a spacecraft crew who hit a strange light planet with three suns. Among the passengers is a serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck get their deposits, the eclipse of all three suns becomes. Shortly thereafter, scary creatures begin to appear and begin to select crew members. During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own because his eyeballs have been surgically lit and gave him night vision. The crew must rely on him to try to get them to safety. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish movie whose sky color changes scene by scene, giving it a very special look. Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, really terrible, but forced to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also basic humor in his performance, which adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role that Vin excels in, the anti-hero whose character is not as one-dimensional as the first. I can imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him. Ride on the Chronicles of Riddick!
