This is not a serious movie, and doesn't pretend to be, but it's not as bad as some of its reviews, it's the title and the first ten minutes lead you to expectations. The storyline is very silly, but it contributes to the fun and passion that goes through the film. Characters are played sympathetically, and while they deal with typical teen anxiety, they generally avoid ill sentimentality usually being found in this film genre. Unusually set up in London, sympathetic to geeks, this is worth watching if it happens; If you want some stupid language in your face, you do not mind that you should reject your mistrust.
