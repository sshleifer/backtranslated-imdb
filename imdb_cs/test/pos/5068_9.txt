A very good political thriller in terms of the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve its goals by flooding terrorists. This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles in years. He plays a cold, costing, cunning CIA director who allows these things to continue. It's outside George Bush-Dick Cheney's school, which deals with the war on terrorism. If her part had been extended, Miss Streep would have been an Oscar. Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. CIA agent who really can't do what's going on. We have a terrorist who actually has a heart and lives in this well-directed, subtly stimulated movie. Alan Arkin appears briefly in a hurrying senator. Mr. Arkin seems to be getting better with age.
