John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean "Les Miserables", while Detective Rains recalls Javerte Victor Hugo, a ruthless arm of law. As in many noirs films, he embodies evil in the city, while earth and nature represent a sanctuary, redemption and a second chance for those whose lives seem to be doomed forever. But even in the light of daylight, the danger may appear suddenly because of the great scene at the dam show. John Garfield-an actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed by any of his films except his the supporting part in the "gentlemen's agreement," but it was not his mistake - giving a cordial, sensitive performance to the audience as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first succession shows a somewhat harsh hypocritical man, but all his attempts to redeem him and how we feel about him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colorful characters (grandmother and kids) add a lot of joie de vivre, which is needed .Humor is also present in the strip poker game because of Dead End brothers fleece rich kid. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
