Anyone who has Lynchian's peculiarity of Twin Peaks, or any HP Lovecraft fan who knows the scariest things are well-known, will be delighted. Do not look like a horror in a "traditional" Western sense, but rather as a Grimma fairy tale. It's cruel and certainly for 16+, but once you start watching, you'll find yourself drawn into the faith. Surely one of those movies that hangs with you for days after watching (I will never look at my snails anyway!)
