Although, this episode was an offensive Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was the wrong way to start a new season. This episode was funny and just shocking. South Park has made history as their first episode with the most cuss words if you don't count the movie as an episode. I liked getting fun of Chris Hansen and his TV show, catching the Predator. I didn't like the idea of ​​how they would think Chris Hansen would make a show tour and let the boy talk and bash the Jews. One thing I didn't like is how South Park thought people with tourettes would just wipe out the wrong language. I saw people on TV with Tourettes and don't just hurt the wrong words. If I'm wrong.
