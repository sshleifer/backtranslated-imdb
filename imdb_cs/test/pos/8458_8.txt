An intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and was soon on the cover of all the newspapers in America (when life imitated the film). A nuclear power plant employee in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with a real race accident story. Seemingly a problem with a stuck valve, the TV news movie shows it was an accident that collapsed with disastrous proportions - and worse yet, the safety conditions are being washed to save millions of dollars, a cover that threatens everyone's lives. The film sometimes gets too technical (especially in the second half) and could use more human interplay, but the performance of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as inflated news-women in the right place at the right time) and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) is excellent . The strike bits involving nuclear protesters are absolutely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news biz (with corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. *** 1/2 from ****
