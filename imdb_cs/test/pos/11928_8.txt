I haven't seen it in years, but when I was about 6 I first saw it on VHS and I had to watch it at least 10 times. Now, as I said it was a while, so I could spoil the plot, but I remember some Columbian terrorists with the preparation of the school hostage with the requirements of the head of a terrorist ("Wish Wish") father to be released from prison. I could just check the plot here on IMDb, but I'm sure it's true. In any case, a group of boys at school decides not to just sit and wait for them to die, so they decide to fight. This movie has always been stuck in my mind. there are so many paintings that I have not forgotten, such as Joey's (think?) scene of death or billy spitting in terrorist sandwiches or in those children (no idea of ​​his name). just a great movie. it may be films like this that gave me tolerance for film violence, because if I remember this movie is a nice graphic. The guys are getting mowing machine guns, special forces boys hand get blown away by a grenade (not sure about it, but they seem to remember something like that at the end) and the bloodiest is the leading terrorist getting capped in the head in details. great action, great humor, good acting performance, great movie experience. I have to follow it again after all these years!
