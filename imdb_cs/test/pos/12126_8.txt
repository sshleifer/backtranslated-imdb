a very surprisingly underrated film. very realistic. with great dialogue. to be Italian, I can definitely relate to situations and phrases. I thought Joe Cortese was great. like a crazy mob cowboy type, and pesci and Vincent were also great. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph devito was on his way to great things, but he was too hampered, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was great. deserved more airplay and recognition. it was a movie sleeper. great. very good. she had really good authenticity. it was good.
