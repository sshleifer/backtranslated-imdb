This is one of the movies that one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it will be about mute, one could look forward to or be afraid of a lot of sentiment. Well, forget it. The film begins with a little black humor and then begins. Since then, he'll take you on a scary ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: unexpected twists are expected and mute is mainly used as a tool for drawing fear. But this movie won't let you go. It's like old gangster movies, but then no glamor in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is located in Russia. This has a big impact on the movie, I think it's better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life is nonsense. This could be a great potential for future films in the future, gangster films about the Russian mafia. It's a beautiful and scary movie. It's horrible, but you can't just feel compassion for a little muting. Last advice: Don't look so late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
