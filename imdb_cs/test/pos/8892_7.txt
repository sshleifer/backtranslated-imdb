College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) is a blocked writer because his former wife Margareth (Kate Mulgrew) has destroyed him and stole his novel, which has become a bestseller. He does not hide his hatred of Margareth, upset his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist), who is an anthropology teacher at the same college. While giving creative writing classes, he is watched by student Owen (Danny DeVito), who wants to know his opinion on his criminal story. Larry says he doesn't like it, and explains that in every mysterious story the killer should remove the motive and create an alibi, otherwise they would catch him. Furthermore, Larry suggests that Owen watch Hitchcock's films to understand the structure of the thrilling story. Owen, who wants to kill his confusing mother (Anne Ramsey), watches "Strangers on the train" and doesn't understand Larry's advice, believing his teacher wants to exchange murders in order to remove the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and while on the ship, Margareth falls overboard disappearing into the sea and is considered dead. However, Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the primary suspect, while Owen, who has fallen apart, is pushing him to kill his mother as part of their supposed agreement. "Throwing Mom off the train" is one of the 80's funniest comedies and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. Direct reference is "aliens on the train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with rotating camera), "plot family" (with car without breaks) and other movies. The lines are excellent and interesting when Larry says every big romance or secret has a train. Anne Ramsey is amazing in the role of an ugly and insulting mother, and the viewer will surely feel grief and understand Owen's madness. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal has an obsessed character with many stupid and disproportionate attitudes, but necessary to conspire. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue and Mamãe do Trem" ("Máz momma from the train")
