My family and I don't normally watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly done, not deep, and just not worth our time. Trailer "Nasaan ka man" caught my attention, my daughter in law and daughter, so we watched this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. Cinematography was very good, the story was a wonderful and acting amazement. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so is Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves that he has been effective in his role. I have never touched, moved, or influenced a local film before. Imagine a cynic like rubbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Journey, Jericho and Claudine !!
