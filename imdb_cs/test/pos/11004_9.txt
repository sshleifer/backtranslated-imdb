It is a beautifully shot film that challenges the future of all indigenous peoples, especially nomadic tribes. The film focuses on Tibetan Saltmen and moves at a pace that can make some Western viewers uncomfortable. For some nations, life still continues at the same pace as it has for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribes for their annual bimonthly effort to get salt. Their tribe lives their lives in a traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always charges their gods. It is a remarkable film that will preserve what may unfortunately become history. Well worth it. Don't be in a hurry when you see it.
