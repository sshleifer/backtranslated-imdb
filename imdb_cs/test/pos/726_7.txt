What can I say? It's not as bad as it is here. The only reason I watched this movie I had never heard before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. The least I was not disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and delivers amazing subtlety in his role. It's always great to watch and for my money ... an extremely untapped actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie .... Every other actor in the movie has added strong, solid performances. Certainly these people were not paid for their participation in a huge amount of money (because it was a relatively low budget movie), but that didn't mean any of them would "send" their performance. They were all convincing and convincing with the given parts <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL, although I have to admit that I only saw it in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie. The storyline was well paced and the story interesting and much like real life, not everything ends up tied up in a nice elegant little package for you at the end of the movie. Anyone who expected a clear number to appear at the end of the film would merge the dots with a "close" or "answer"â€¦ CLEARLY didn't warn the movie enough! This movie won't tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching a movie you could go and discuss unanswered questions with friends over coffee. I'm sure I did. No car chases ... No explosions ... No bar room battles .... (sounds pretty boring, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely devoured by the movie and it's just good written a small piece with an interesting hook and solid performances by all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you're a kind of person who doesn't like movies that hang out of a huge "question" as the story's central engine, and then ends the movie without answering this particular question directly ... <br /> <br /> YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS FILM.
