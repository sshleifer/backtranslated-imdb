"The Pharaoh's army" defies the pattern. Instead of pretending to be clichÃ©s and big stars, he relies entirely on the outstanding performance of a strong cast, the power of a well-written script, and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic movie that moves fast, with a great emotional stream. One of the best I've ever seen about Civil War, and I think it may owe that the pleasure of an independent film (if you like this movie, try to see a similarly brilliant independent Civil War movie "Wicked Spring" "Pharaoh" simply tells the real story of a small team of expedition / feed team men from the Union who drive to a Confederate farm to make arrangements, but eventually one of the men gets stuck there because of the tension and relationships are created and broken. this film comes from the mind of someone who takes care of a quality film and storytelling, and the exquisite dialogue and exposition of exposition move around a film that looks very professional, but often does not feel like watching a movie, more in the spirit of the story. br /> <br /> The film boasts an incredible performance of Chris Cooper, who shows amazing versatility in exploring his ro It is transformed, but it is always at the level of plausibility and can be easily emotionally related to it. Patricia Clarkson is just as stellar and realistic in the role that many actresses would disintegrate. He shares interesting chemistry with the character of Cooper and where he is becoming increasingly serious about the character he can easily identify with. The rest of the cast is quite capable and performs its roles well. <br /> <br /> The artistic design and set are beautiful and I love cinematography personally. All this has a Civil War photograph with a camera that presents strong contrasting colors and shadows and a tin metal shade, but always preserves the natural look of a rustic setting. They seem to have used natural lighting, but everything they use works beautifully. Everything seems to belong to where it is, to feel the period, something I find rarely in American period films. Actors act in the 19th century, not as 20th century people in old clothes. This film is primarily very personal. I think he can afford it as an independent. The film is almost flawless with an excellent script that effortlessly creates and examines the relationships and personalities of those characters and allows them to grow in a situation that is as bad as it is. This is not a failure in getting is a point across, and it is a point across without the usual and overused techniques that are used in all war movies these days. It's brave. It relies on its characters, fantastic script, human emotions, and the cold, hard fact that civil war was not all CGI, big stars, and skirts.
