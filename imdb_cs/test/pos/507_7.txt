Overall, I give this movie a decent 7.6. To begin with, I will say that I love how the character was depicted and adapted to the screen. If you occasionally read comics or simply watch DVD extras, you'll see that Blade's character is significantly different from what we see in the movie. Among these changes, Blade is now the most important half of the vampire, and so it gains "all its strengths, but none of its weaknesses." This is obviously due to David Goyer, who is a fan of the darker comics genre. Thanks to him, Blade has become a more interesting character and I really consider him one of my favorite heroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some would probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here may not be exactly Oscar-winning in terms of character, but I'm glad he decided to play DayWalker in two sequels. Also played by Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred. The activity is actually good and the action keeps it going. The opening scene at the club is one of my favorite parts to say. Like this movie, there are several things that bother me and take away this movie series with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington had the bad guys portrayed the way I liked it. Their line was so full of comedy that I didn't like it as a comic book. Plus "La Magra" a bit disappointed as the last villain, but the intense fight with the sword is what I mean. Not to mention the sense of further non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword that climbs # $% of the cops in the broad daylight. ..dumb. The music from Mark Isham, which has diverted from a few of its shortcomings, was great and nicely put into it. Fortunately, all these problems are fixed and improved in the stunning sequel "Blade 2".
