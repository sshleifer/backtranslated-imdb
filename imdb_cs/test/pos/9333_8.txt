Although I'm not a Michael Jackson fan, I like some of his first songs and some of Jackson 5 too. "Thriller" is one of his great songs and comes from the best-selling album of the same name. As for the video, it's amazing, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and weird. Behind this video is a story, but it's so complicated that I can't even fully understand it. It's weird. The biggest things are Jackson's conversion to a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf), and those dead people dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cool and original. There are great scenery and settings. Music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old pop of the 1980s. I like Vincent Price's soliloquy. He makes a great storytelling with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter in the end is awesome! My favorite videos from the "King of Pop" are "Billie Jean" and "Don't Stop until You Get Enough" (both of his best songs).
