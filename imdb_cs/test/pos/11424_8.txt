Stan Laurel, it was noted, first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He will surely prove to be an excellent comedy actor and performer here in "mud and sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valntino "Blood and Sand"), but I don't think such a movie really works because Laurel was a big satirist, but because the viewer can jump into comedy , which is already known by situations and scenes. Laurel can then be released with his inspired gags without creating or doing context. I looked at it the day after I watched the blood and sand itself; it certainly strengthened the experience of knowing what was parodied and where. Scene where character Laurel (Rhubarb Vaseline if you believe the title cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board) bilks his mother out of money with two-for-you, two -for-me trick is funny on your own because it's a big gag, but it's funny if the viewer is aware of how it is with the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promise to give the mother any luxury that wishes. This is Stan Laurel's best solo work I've seen. It's just funny - even more if you have seen the source material.
