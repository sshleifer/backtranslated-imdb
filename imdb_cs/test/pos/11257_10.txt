I saw this movie for the first time today (November 5, 2005). I wanted to watch it because I saw basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and I loved it, but it was much harder. I think it had a good picture of drugs to some extent. I usually feel like Nick Stahls, probably because if I was someone I was crazy about, he would like me to help them get out of it. A promising student and sportsman who spends all his time training and studying - it is understandable that he wants to try a teenage life (crazy party) and in his efforts as he starts he helps his friend who ends up addicted, wants to see what all this is about is, and because of his terrible family situation, which results in his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but one mistake I noticed is that you don't get a good enough insight into the damage it inflicts on families, but on top of that, it's a truly heartbreaking movie.
