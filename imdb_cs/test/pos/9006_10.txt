Forever strong is one of those sports movies you can really watch. It reminded me of a lot of memories of Titans, because it included comedy, sadness and just amazing. I saw it on pre-screen and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their best 2 sports movies. There's a great acting performance in the movie. Even though it's similar Remember Titans, there's something unique about this movie. I feel it is definitely Oscar worthy and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely go see this movie and it's worth $ 10. I'll have to see it again when it comes out because it was so good. I can't say anything bad about the movie.
