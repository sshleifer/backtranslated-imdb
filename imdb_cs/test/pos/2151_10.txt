I was fortunate enough to see this movie at the Seattle Film Fest and I was blown away as much as it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best music documents I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look at life and times, music and the relationships of one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up with Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great writers of 20th century standards. All four members of the Beatles considered him a peer who called him the 5th Beatle and one of the same wavelengths as them. Harry refused to tour, so many people don't remember him today, and those who were born after his heyday don't know who he was. This is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this amazing talent. This film is a step in the right direction to give man a remedy. Unfortunately, the film must still have a wide distribution, or even a DVD, so at this point, good luck in seeing it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone with the power to put together a DVD distribution, please contact the filmmaker. This movie must be available. Hi VH-1, how is it projected in the air, then maybe on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
