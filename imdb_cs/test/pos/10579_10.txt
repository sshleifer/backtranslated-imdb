I like Sarah Waters Fingersmith, and was worried about the TV adaptation as I was disappointed with the BBC version of Tipping the Velvet (which though a beautiful look at letting Keeley Hawes not be able to sing, and Rachael Stirling not being able to act). Fingersmith is a very tight fantasy novel with breaths and twists and I was wondering if it could be done in just 3 hours. I don't have to worry. The adjustment was excellent, very little cut and went along with a cracked pace (although I wondered if you read the book, would you miss something?). He had the look and feel of the drama of the classic BBC costume and I had to keep reminding myself that it was a contemporary book. Acting was stellar. Sally Hawkins performed as Sue Trinder and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner who was as hot as Maud Lilley at the end of the story. Love, passion, and the realization of acts of betrayal were written on their faces. It's a pleasure to watch. I hope Rachael Stirling watched: you play Sarah Waters!
