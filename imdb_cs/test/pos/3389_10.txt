I agree with the message that the book is not like a film. I have read the book as a sophomore in high school in Sumter SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and eagerly awaited the release of the mini series. Just as I liked the movie and thought it was very well done, I was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book. I was glad that Orry wasn't killed as if he were in love and war or in N&S II. When I grew up in SC and graduated from the University of SC, I fell in love with southern history because of the mini series and books. I had the privilege to meet John Jakes at the 1988 USC Symposium. I stayed there and met Mr. Jakes. Unfortunately, I didn't ask him. But meeting him was fair enough. I studied accounting, but I studied south in my youth. Besides, I created a lot of my mannerisms for Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel like I was born 150 years late. I'm a southern gentleman and I'm very proud of it. Well I fell in love with two women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, I had hots for Wendy !!!! I could never find a real life version. I hope one day too!
