I was watching a movie about 13 years ago when I was living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I found him on the shelves of a small shop on the back that doesn't bother to walk most. To my pleasure I found him and watched him with the intention of owning him one day and being in my collection. I don't have it yet, but one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept of poetry and fantasy. Semi street scenes with a busy far-flung team city added to the visual effect. Many times I have mentioned this film to people who enjoy the genre with nothing but praise. It seems to me in the head and it will come for a long time. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie, but only those that are in this type. <br /> <br /> This commentary and Ten of LA, CA can help you choose this movie. Comments can be negative, but I found them positive when you look at a derogatory connotation.
