Excellent performance. Good actors are still here! Also great direction and photography. Very true to Shakespeare, and 'Necessity' for all Shakespear fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) overwhelmed me with tears with his last monologue (out of a short candle, out) He put a human face in the sphere of moral decline and dark power, making it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very trustworthy lady of Macbeth, who can sometimes be very cheerful and sometimes looks like a naughty girl, but a deadly appetite for blood and evil. If you love death and decline and Shakespeare's lyrics ... this is the one.
