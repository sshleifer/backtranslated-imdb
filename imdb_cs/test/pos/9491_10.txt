I bought the first Zep album in 1974 (at 17) and I've been addicted ever since. This DVD has now taken a place in my music collection. It's not often that the band boasts 4 virtuosos in their lineup, but here we can. Each member contributed their own band, but on stage together, the electricity they created was larger than 4 individuals. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and this DVD is beautifully captured, as each show shows how the band has grown bigger and bigger over the years. Recently my copy has disappeared, but I'm glad I found my son 17yo in the room when the new generation found out how much these guys were. This is a must for anyone who has a rock music award. Long Life Led Zeppelin.
