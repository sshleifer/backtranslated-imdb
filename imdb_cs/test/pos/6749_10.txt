This is an excellent horror movie that borders on horror and comedy. It's a genetically disfigured scorpion in space. Could it be more unreal? It's a cross between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre." The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes who communicate beautifully. Director Martin Munthe does a great job of finding comic points in this scenario and getting some good laughs from the audience. The film was shot with little or no money and is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the features of the B-movie horror film. This is comic and frightening at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their stuff. It's great to see that movies like this are still possible! I recommend to see if you like this type of movies.
