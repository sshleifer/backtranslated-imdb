What often threatens to turn into a rough and soft drama about misunderstood young middle-class people ends in the surprisingly overshadowed and subdued film of John Frankenheimer (his first, even though he started on television, among other things, he directed an earlier version of this film). are we still in those semi-mythical ??? 50s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still overalls. James MacArthur (adoptive son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, later joins pop culture as Hawaii 5-0's Danno) participates in a minor incident in the cinema that returns to his blow at the executive (Whit Bissell) and is booked at a police station . His father (James Daly), a big-footage film producer, calls, does not listen to his story and pulls the strings to turn him off. But MacArthur still keeps the chip on his shoulder, which even his likeable mom (Kim Hunter) can't knock. Things get worse in the Coldwater Canyon Homestead until MacArthur, trying to defend himself, can handle a repeat of the original incident. and clich√©s? of their time, but it presents them with considerable nuances: each character has an honorable hearing; each view has its advantages (and the response to the film will depend on what the audience will bring). There are shortcomings (the word "crummy", the standard rebellious euphemism of the era, used about thirty times too often), but outweigh the strengths. The film benefits from a strong cast (most notable of which is outstanding actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a resolutely untapped way of telling his story. From the perspective of the new millennium, the hot water of MacArthur finds itself a little lukewarm, but the young stranger remains honest and honest. <br /> <br />
