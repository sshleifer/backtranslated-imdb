Red Skelton (in his lead role) plays Wally Benton, who plays The Radio The Fox. He writes mysteries about the murder and solves them as 'The Fox'. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to make a perfect murder for someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He tells Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his girlfriend get it ... Fast moving (it's just 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect casting really does. Skelton is very good at his first starring role - very funny, fast, handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are a lot of fun as Skelton's girlfriend. All three play perfectly together - their verbal fight is the highlight of this pic. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. Well worth your time.
