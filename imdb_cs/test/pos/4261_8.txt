Putney Swope is the story of a well-known black man on the board of a large advertising company, who was mistakenly elected chairman of the board when the business owner sneezed while trying to stutter that he was apparently quite excited. . Of course, Putney takes his new role in the heart and fires most at the agency, hires a new crew (all black, except for a white token) and throws out the most offensive and non-PC ads. for. She is rather a diverse crew now, and yet she manages to succeed in raking in cash. Rather, I like the scene where potential advertisers are released from the money bags and then they said to get out. And their ads will follow later, like them or not. The story is good, but of course there is an ugly ad in itself, especially the one that is designed for acne cream "Face Off". This is a pretty old but still fun movie and full of fun moments. Robert Downey Sr. he worked for an advertising agency that was conducting experimental ads at the time, and I think it was his middle finger to Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and damn funny. 8 out of 10.
