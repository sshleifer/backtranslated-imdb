A film that reveals the restlessness of modern men and women in life when confronted with death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife and what is more in any hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. But human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially because we can push it away for a long time. Moreover, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical for the end of the 20th century. Things are changing today, especially when United States President Barack Obama talks to journalists about their search for the truth in public speech and qualifies it as a matter of course because it is a task rather than a final end, goal or success. The film shows the end of an old good metaphysical thought that began to develop into obedience to truth, an obsessive concept that truth was unique and irreversibly achievable. Postmodernism has not yet reached Hollywood, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go to death and return. Technically possible, but the result is not surprising. Reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that have been buried in the subconscious. One has to do with a drug addict father of a Vietnamese veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who has been stoned to death by some, including tripper death, another with a young black girl who was sacrificed and bullied in primary school. from racism, sexism and hatred, if not fear of her shyness. It's so naive that you could scare these shameful shouts out of these young adults who are highly skilled and behave like children who cry for their fruit juice bottles with sauce. The film is interesting, but something completely different. Setting and filming and every single detail or treatment of any detail is Baroque, morbid, decadent, totally in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or some other artwork that deals with a friend's match with a basic enemy, death is. Of course, it doesn't save the movie, but at least it's worth watching. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
