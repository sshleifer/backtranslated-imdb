I loved it, but I'm 80 years old. I loved Rainbow Bright all my childhood. I don't know if those little ones would be interested in the show these days, not mine. (But that's okay, I bought it for me anyway. I brought the little one, so the guy at the box office wouldn't look at me for fun.) It just reminds me of a simpler time than cartoons have more violence than our local news can legally show. :) Although I can only be a little biased about the subject. After all, I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol.
