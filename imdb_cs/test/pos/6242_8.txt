A group of young passengers who have just run out of gas are going to a strange wax museum called "Saluesen's Lost Oasis" owned by a strange man named Slausen (Chuck Conners) because the dummies are controlled by mysterious power and the madman with special powers wants to be dead. One of the most valuable horror movies from the late 70s! This Charles Band (producer of "Re-Animator") production has become one of the most frightening and unique low-budget horror productions that combines some psychological motives without having to somehow cause a gore to be similar to a regular movie. The film keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some fears, the film has become a cult diamond in the rough for the genre ever since, and it is well worth watching.
