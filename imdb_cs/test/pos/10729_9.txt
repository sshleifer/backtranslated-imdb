Normally, movies remain outside the realm of "home drama", and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them must deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and the ties of battle are ugly and necessary parts of it. This is not an escape - the reason why the average person turns to films - this is a sad reality. Divorce or custody is usually part of a larger story and affects the way we understand it or its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why it makes it so disturbing. This is a challenge both for this film and for its audience: to turn something so real into something that could attract our attention and then not feel us sinister when the mirror is on its face. Writer / director Robert Benton definitely reaches both in impressive fashion and in adapting this novel to Avery Corman. The story, as one might expect, is quite simple: Big Business Advertising Man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Then Ted must quickly learn to be an active father in boys' lives, and as soon as he does, Joanna takes the suit to him. Make an Oscar drama about something so general and especially dialogue - hard first takes a huge acting talent. You don't have much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his lead role in this role: his first Oscar wins after three other notable nominations. It creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and fast-tempered ways are clearly changing when learning to be a better father and the only caregiver. Streep wins his first Oscar only in the second major role of his career as a woman who doesn't have much time on the screen but has to tell how inner suffering in her decision to leave as well as a renewed sense of identity when she returns to custody. Streep does it effortlessly. A young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest candidate for the competition category in the history of the Academy, plays the epitome of all 7-year-olds exceptionally well. Benton's writing and direction takes it to a level where we see deeper into the problems of this family than we do, and we re-evaluate our thoughts about love and family upbringing. Benton's previous remarkable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") would not indicate a strong command of the family drama, but one can write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they show. The first morning Joanna is gone, and Ted from Billy's French toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talents that come into this movie in the scene that happens in American kitchens every morning. Rarely see a story as straightforward as "Kramer vs." Kramer did better. There are no surprises at the end or twists that will desperately stick to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talent and everyone is sure of the fire that brings a new understanding of the subject so familiar.
