This is a modest, unobtrusive traditional Western with a formulation plot about opposition between farmers and crop farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially a routine and features a number of classical Western conflicts. There is a farmer versus cattleman; there is a clash between cultivated soil and "civilization" tendencies on the one hand, and wilderness / border ethos on the other, and what this ultimately represents is the opposition of two value systems - democratic and community values, as opposed to harsh individualism. Randolph Scott plays legendary attorney Bata Masterton, who goes to Liberal at the direction of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him solve the bad people who are tough drinkers who struggle with the lads. solve problematic elements in the city. The script is clich√©, but the action is driven along with director Ray Enright's performance and solid performance of all. In addition to the harsh performances of male leaders, there is a comic relief delivered by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain that Steve Brodie has pretty played by and appealing contributions by Maggie Meredith as Senior and Right Eastern wooed Ryan and Anna Jeffreys as a singer salon If you don't provide a premium for originality, it's a good solid pastime for West lovers
