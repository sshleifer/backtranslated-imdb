This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our present world. Social criticism of our shallow, commercially-oriented values ​​is what makes this film an extraordinary vision of "war is hell" clichés, underlined by a mythical path that goes to Cambodia with a Special Forces captain whose job is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) the rogue colonel he left the concept of the justice of the army to create his own world. When I saw the Apocalypse in 1980, I thought it was a profoundly wrong masterpiece. In particular, I found the last segment of the road with Brando, which contains Conrad's heart of darkness to be somewhat boring. Finally, I got to see the Apocalypse, now Redux and the mistakes were taken care of. Redux makes the film a masterpiece, certainly among the 100 best films ever made. Brando's performance now appears to be complete and complete, perhaps somewhat less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant in the heart of one of the best actors ever collected. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. In the early projections that suggest what subtle actors will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvalle, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by more footage. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and head straight to Redux. I wish we could get the New York gangs Redux of Scorcese to fill all the gaps in this deeply faulty potential masterpiece.
