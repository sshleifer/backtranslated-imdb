I never realized what a wonderful dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 and beautiful. It's a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story was typical of his day, but the dance was really special. I've never followed Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner was just as amazing in this movie. I always thought of Lana as an actress who was prone to action. She should have done more dance and fewer roles for Maddam X and Peyton Place. I had a new recognition for her after seeing this movie and her amazing dance. Too bad the "Academy" doesn't give "Oscar" for dancing.
