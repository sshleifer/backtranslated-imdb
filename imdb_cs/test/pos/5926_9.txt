The word impossible led many to choose a particular view of every incredible task. In 1927, it was believed no man could fly the Atlantic Ocean breath. Many have tried, but failed, and some have even put their efforts to this endeavor. But it had to be done because every challenge must be met with the same determination. This is the heart of this film called "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor selected for this historical film is none other than American's own James Stewart who convincingly plays Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many aspects of Lindbergh's life, the segment featured here is his effort to be the first man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and at least convincing for Steward fans. Looking for enough money to build a special aircraft, the fateful decision to launch a gloomy day in May 1927, "Luck Lindy," as he was baptized, endured the enormous risks that appear in this amazing film. Other notables that helped make this movie believable are Murray Hamilton who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The total sum of this famous movie today is that despite his poor consent to his debut, he has since become a classic in his own right. Great! ****
