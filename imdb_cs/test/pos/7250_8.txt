Plunkett and Macleane is a fun, fast and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike most other contemporary films, it does not seek to give audiences a historical lesson or to preach pompously - in fact, historical accuracy is ignored. This film is not taken too seriously and tries to amuse rather than illuminate. Plunkett and Macleane are set in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott is 90 years old. There's action, sex and swearing, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy is dancing to disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as ever, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also very fun. The film is visually spectacular in places, and is a blend of comedy, action and drama, with the love of interest provided by Liv Tyler with a shaky English accent. In short, if you're looking for a few hours of fun, it's a movie for you. It won't think, but it might give a smile on your face.
