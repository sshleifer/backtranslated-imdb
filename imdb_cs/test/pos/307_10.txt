Spoilers. This review has been modified to limit words. `Horror. Horror. ' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> A sentence that is as famous as "Here is looking at you, child," or "Are you talking to me?" or `Let there be power with you ', or` `I'll be back' ', means a little more than some only. When it speaks, it persists in the air with meaning and meaning that will not go unnoticed. What could drive some viewers nuts is that they can never find the answer to the horror if they re-watch the movie and try to pay close attention to each individual slide. <br /> <br /> What exactly does this line of dialogue mean? The horror we are talking about is the reality of war. The reality of moral people is so easily damaged that they turn to their innate instincts and kill their neighbors without any guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands in front of the dying Cole Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the movie, "Horror. Horror." is the realization of Willard's corruption. As part of his task, he mercilessly killed a cold-blooded man. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases, he gets something, emotionally, physically, mentally, or all three. But Willard's profits and losses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morale. And this is a shocking end. "Apocalypse Now" is a tribute to Francis Ford Coppola's artistic side of filmmaking. This film is completely different from the movie "Godfather". It is a hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, then symbolic, and ultimately original in its unique view of the spiritual side of the struggle. It's not so much about a film about the war in Vietnam, like a film about war in us. Initially, it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned to a military lieutenant (young Harrison Ford) to assassinate an American colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding somewhere in Vietnam with a pile of soldiers who act more or less like his slaves. Willard fulfills his mission "with extreme prejudice", sets out on a ship along with four soldiers, including ship's captain, chief (Albert Hall), chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young man. "Larry" Fishburne (who later appeared as Morpheus in "The Matrix"). "Apocalypse Now" is a modern update to Homer's Odyssey in many ways. As our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he meets a number of original and special characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange surfing fetish, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose live gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the much smaller Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel", which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Davies couldn't make contact with the audience; Hopper. It's like a poetic atmosphere between Willard and Kurtz; is like an interpreter who goes back and forth and speaks foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs Willard's translation. Many movies are lucky enough to have one or two unforgettable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore descending on the Vietnamese village playing Wagner's "Ride of Valkyries" remains one of the most memorable scenes in film history. There is sharpness, brutality, ironic tone and playfulness. When Kilgore kneels on the beach and says, "I love the scent of napalm in the morning." He smells like victory, we all smiled. I will not lie to you: 'The Apocalypse is now a special movie. It's not the easiest thing to analyze. The end can frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speech. But what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. Terror is the realization of war and its consequences, not the war itself. Kurtz says, â€œYou have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge. For many naive viewers, it may seem like a crazy loon whose power has come to its head. But that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to overcome. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how great it was and how bad it was for others. By strolling through devastated villages, they eventually realize that we are naive and live our lives in a fool's paradise. We are absolutely naive to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they come across. By seeing some of the Vietnamese unhappy, Kurtz realizes how easily something could be affected. How easily he could end up like people around him. And she also realizes that the people who did it are people who have left their morals and left them at the door. Many people think that horror is one thing. It's two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naive he was and the reality of the impact of war on men. And after Willard murdered Kurtz and heard Kurtz's dying words, he also realizes that. He is aware of the consequences of war. Seeing so many soldiers who have no sense of right or wrong is aware of the horror of what a war with a man can do. And what he did to him. Terror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
