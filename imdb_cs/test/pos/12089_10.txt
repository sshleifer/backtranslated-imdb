I've been away from Istanbul for the last 10 years. During that time I lived in London all the time. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I was Istanbuler. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm part of Turkey. One of my parts is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. Probably Faith Akin thought he did a great music documentary, but I have to say it's more than that. The point is to put a delicious mix of totally different musical works, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnicities into a delicious pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know, Turkey is exactly Istanbul, always coming and going between the East or western city. As one of the band members said Istanbul is a bi-cultural city. But much more is the eastern city because we have always tried to be a western city. It shows that we have never been one. This movie gets caught from the first second. Music is excellent, people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! It's nice to see you in a small movie theater at Wood Green.
