This documentary captures the beginnings and lives of the Zephyr skateboarding team, using an original film shot in the 1970s (mostly by Craig Stecyk), combined with team members' interviews and other influential people today. The first part of the film documentaries, as the "Dogtown" part of Venice, CA came, starting around the turn of the century when the city was created to be Venice, Italy-like European city. In the 1970s, one of the remaining local attractions, the Pacific Ocean Park, was abandoned and left a beach with lots of exposed moths and other dangers. Poor children living in this area had nothing better than surfing and excelled despite (or perhaps because of) the surroundings. As the waves scattered in the afternoon, they started skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty pools caused by the droughts in those years, along with their surfing, led to the creation of a vertical skateboarding style that is commonplace today. <br /> <br /> I found that the film covers a lot more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like a bonus because I didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before watching the movie. The soundtrack, not surprisingly, was also good. I also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better for the experience. The parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the somewhat over-felt sense of self-esteem (though it was probably just a stance from the street where they were growing). up). However, this does not mean that they have no significant impact, but only that it seems very likely that there are other factors. One Note: My wife is more affected than most of them nausea when movies use what we call "SpastiCam" (moving camera movement). This movie is often guilty, so be warned if you are so disabled. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to anyone who has skateboarding and / or surfing in their history. Seen on November 5, 2002.
