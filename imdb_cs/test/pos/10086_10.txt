"The Two Sisters Story" must be one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Finally, there is no real supernatural element, despite what is expected during the film. They seem to be two sisters who, after returning to their father's home after some absence (later discovered as a psychiatric stay), have to deal not only with a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly a bipolar stepmother who sets off for younger girls when her mood hits and tells them cheerfully that she has prepared a special dinner at a different time. Later it turned out that the younger sister was dead and existed only in the troubled minds of her older sister who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was insensitive enough to let her die. Much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves the viewer with a fearsome feeling and an unpleasant hint of confusion. Surely there is no light observation; watch this when you really want to think about what you saw. It's a hell of a puzzle.
