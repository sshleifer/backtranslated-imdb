Love Jones is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main element that holds me is the fact that it is very well directed. I studied this film in its entirety - watching movies more than once, certain things that subconsciously shine on you - the direction of this film, as well as writing, is elegant, modern and refined! I'm in love with the direction. The scene where Larenz Tate and Nia Long ride a motorcycle overnight in northern Chicago is overwhelming. The director of this film has received awards for his great work. Love Jones is an elegant and sexy movie. It emphasizes the fact that we can be people who love, have shortcomings who love to live, learn and be without us. Be our natural self. Poetry is amazing, but the story, dialogue and scenes really do this movie. This film deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit down and watch, or hopeless romantic (like me) to sit and enjoy alone on Friday or Saturday night. Every day of the week, where peace, loneliness and a little fun are needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
