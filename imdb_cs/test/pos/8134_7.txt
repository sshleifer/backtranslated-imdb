That was the last silent movie of Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, since the public had a real thirst for "interviews", this same short team was re-created by the team only a few years later with some small changes in the plot. STEP GRAVY was basically the same conspiracy, except that Stan and Ollie tried to hide a cute puppy from their annoying landlord - not goats like ANGORA LOVE. The whole goat angle is the worst part of the movie. While you might understand boys who want to keep a cute dog (it's snowy after all), why just bringing a goat home is just fanciful and absurd. According to the conspiracy, the goat followed home, and they got tired of being thrown away and left. Huh?! It just doesn't make any sense - if it was a giraffe or a cow, would they do the same? In addition to being an unconvincing plot, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with familiar plot and familiar roles for comics. This film has quite a few laughs, but unfortunately it is not one of their better films that would wrap their silent career. This aspect of their career seems to be whining.
