For those who like to think of themselves as intellectually intelligent human beings who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with a witty, elegantly written dialogue, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> For those who have low attention, high expectations and no brains .. well .. um .. you can get bored and find things that sometimes pull. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, modest and well-worn movie with actors giving their roles a real sense of depth and warmth. I laughed quite a bit through the way for me .. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little gem.
