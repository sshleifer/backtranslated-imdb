I think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of Giorgio rating in full, just because it's one of those that is dependent on the film, the complex, poetic, and philosophical films they have on the brain if you're trying to track them using their shell and getting to their core at the same time, however there are several things that are certain and without doubt for any man of art (which I hope I am). First thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even an art that remains for a long time; second: it is one of those rare "dark" films in which the darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much sadder than depressing, like the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. Regarding the core of the film, somebody called it Kafkian, although I disagree with it, because in fact it is far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like the parable of Edgar Poe: dark and frightening, but through touching the finest chains of our soul. On the poet's side (which is more important than narration), Giorgino is a story of eternal peace and love that can only be achieved by the eternal childhood of the soul. Usually, those who have such souls are called crazy by our society, but from a different perspective, they all have the virtue that everyone else has lost when they have become "adults": the virtues of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "Be Like Children" (Mt 18: 3) is that true hidden mark-line, although the film never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the Christian philosophy for, dare to suppose. , true God is beyond any human morality. However, I believe that Boutonnat is too harsh, portraying "adult" people like demons who are trying to steal childhood from precious surviving souls, but it is his opinion and has the right to think. While watching Giorgio, do not try to find some hidden symbols (even if they are some), better look at the ideas expressed through characters and their behavior and learn from them. Also, I can not mention that the film looks amazing thanks to the excellent photo, especially the rational use of color filters, the incredibly concise cut, the wonderful acting performance of all the games and, of course, the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains that reminded me of Brueghel's "Snow Hunters". Interestingly, the scene with Death in the form of an old woman with eyes that burst into a black ring on a horse reminded me immediately of Pesta (Plague) from a series of drawings by Norwegian painter Theodore Kittelsen, showing how the black plague swells the inhabitants of a small town in a mountain valley . Is it coincidence?
