The visual effect of this movie is incomparable to anything I've seen. And the work needed to achieve this goal must have been incredibly long and tedious (in this camera, you don't stick to "Kodak Grainy Film" to look at it). Do not look at this film to be entertaining, watch it visually stimulated, see if it is attacked and provoked in your thoughts on the film, and on any other topic that comes to mind, religion is likely to be one thought. <br /> <br />
