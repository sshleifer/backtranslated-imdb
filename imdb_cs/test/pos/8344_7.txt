This film is apparently designed for a young, evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give him 7 out of 10 points. It's a decent movie that shows a youth group, but I don't think it will be very well received. I would consider it much less for all the other audiences. Reviewers who saw "It's a wonderful life" were right, even though I didn't mean it until they mentioned it. I was more alerted to "Chick Tract", those little 3 "5" comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie from one of his tracts, it would probably look like "Second Look". He has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and influence that each of us has on earth, but is somewhat limited by Christian stereotypes. All Christians are very nice, somewhat passive and dirty, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. Muriel Angel plays an important role and is the nicest, holiest in the movie. It's the most unlikely angel I've ever seen in every movie, and the biggest negative. I don't know if the directors intended his personality to fall so badly or if he hit me like that. (I admit he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very secular girl who is not his type at all, drives the storyline in this movie. Why did it fall in the first place is one question I wanted her to be answered. However, the film shows positive Christian values ​​and your youth group will enjoy having a healthy lesson with a good lesson.
