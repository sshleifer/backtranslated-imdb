If vampire stories are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. The real consortium of the undead in the contemporary environment, Michael Rymer's "The Damned Queen", is the story of shadows and darkness and unhappy souls who stay there forever. Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been sleeping for many years; But all of a sudden, the sounds of this world that hears from his widespread change of sleep, and likes what he hears, sets out to explore. What he finds is a world full of new sounds, a new kind of music - control and penetration - sounds that attack the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that his time has finally come, that it is time for him and those who like him to go to the open door and face their world. To this end, he becomes a frontman of the band - a singer and performer, unlike the world he has ever known. She introduces herself as a vampire, and very quickly gathers a follow-up that goes far beyond London (where it all starts), and finally takes him to Death Valley in California, where she plans a concert that promises to see or experience for nothing else. Lestat is powerful, no doubt, but there are his kind who do not favorably reveal the fact that he has revealed them, one of them is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right - a vampire who in the fact "Lestata has been doing so many years before - and they are gathering, meeting and making plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they don't go to music. But there is something else: Lestat inadvertently awakened in one place the "Mother" of all, the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make his presence available to everyone, and especially to the one she chose to rule her party as her king: Lestat. And at the concert, at ease, Akasha will be present, without failure. Don't make a mistake, it's Lestat's story, and Rymer presents him in the midst of an atmosphere rich in atmosphere with some wonderful moments, though his film has less bite to say, 'Interview with Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker is Dracula. It sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real excitement, but overall the film is not so wet in jeopardy as it could be, or as much as one could expect. In the final summary, in fact, the amount of meat that burns wins over the actual renting of blood, although there is more than just the gore taste, and more than a fair share of lips and mouth dripping with red cloth. There are also a few good F / Xs, especially in sequences that emphasize the speed of vampires as they move and rush through the air faster than a mere eye recognizable. It's Rymer's decent work, but he could have put more teeth into it than he would have played on the alienation Lestat had indicated; as it is, you get a sense of separation, but not enough to fully involve you. In "The Vampire Interview," Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to Lestat's role, but Townsend is even more effective with a look and attitude that perfectly captures Lestat. He plays it with a sense of acceptance and under close supervision you can even find a hint of regret and desire. It is a good performance and one that convincingly sells its character. Like Marius, Vincent Perez also does a nice job - in fact, it's one of the strengths of the film - although his character is a bit ambiguous; However, it has more in common with how it was written than with Perez's performance, which is pretty good. Spinning in remarkable performances is also Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and beautiful Lena Olin as Maharet, Aunt Jesse, who ultimately plays a key role in the outcome of Lestat and Akasha. Aalija is, like Akasha, an absolutely engrossing presence. What more can a talented artist say about her, with great talent and beauty. And tragically she left us too soon. Supported by Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy) ). With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans will be particularly pleased with the film Queen of the Damned, which is nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast. By focusing on the drama of the story - and the way it is presented - before focusing solely on providing cheap delicacies, Rymer succeeded in averting a real horror movie that is definitely upstairs, and one that can only encourage your appetite for more of the same . And that's the magic of movies. I rate it 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
