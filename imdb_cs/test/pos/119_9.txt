Finally I watched the third movie in the Mehta trilogy: "Fire". To begin with, I would say that "Water" was an undisputed masterpiece at all levels. The fire comes close to Earth close behind in quality. Fire: There's so much going on in this movie that I need a few more insights to drink it all. Writing is excellent, the scenario creates friction that starts the whole process of "heat" from start to finish when it really explodes into a fire, conflicts move to a complete burst of relationships. Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a bright eye a lot that is jealous, false and repressive about the great society she comes from. India is changing rapidly these days, but much of it is economic change. Having encountered such a fierce opposition to the creation of "water" after the script has been erased shows that there are still many taboo topics that more than less can not be looked at or discussed by Indian people more than less. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold a mirror on these issues, he faces the threat of death. Just as India considers itself a pluralist, tolerant society, facts are not always so. While "Earth" was merely the historical environment of the bloodshed of civil war after Indian independence, fire and water point to personal, social and religious issues that, as I say, are so strongly (in a negative sense) considered open. artistic dialogue is still many years. As I write this "water", it is planned that it will actually be displayed in India later this year. I believe if I see it. Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional riddle I've seen in the "price over rubies". Whether it is a marriage contracted (about 150 years ago, or similar to many modern Indians), there is a risk that they will have a bad struggle that will be forced on both men and women; Or just plain marriage without love ... This is not a real problem. Mehta is apparently impatient with absolutely strict religious attitudes that either keep the widows in poverty (water), or otherwise keep women enslaved in a marriage without love (Fire). I'm not an expert on secular or Hindu divorce laws. The film seems to suggest that stigma is almost as bad as sad marriage. In any case, Mehta's film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that keeps modern Indian relationships after exploring. That all these three movies felt like an unjustified attack on their culture in India seemed like a predictable pressure to repressive thinking. Mehta makes these questions look no matter how much flack is. I admire her work and I cannot recommend her films. Excellent, distracting, provocative, taboo.
