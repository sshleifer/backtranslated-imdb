What is the strongest movie of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three very violent together, and you still won't equal the stabilizer massacre, the wildest, craziest, craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes things will explode and people will die by dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and cheer, and when it's over, you'll be more than a little exhausted. This movie is buried by a gem, a cult classic unfortunately lacks a cult. The stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a great greasy man with a curly mullet. He comes to Indonesia to track the villains and means Greg Rainmaker. We know he is evil because he is referred to only by his full name ("I hate SCUM as Greg RAINmaker!") And he uses the killing method that is so terrible that I can't even say it here. Wait, yes, I can. He performs on people in pointed shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. When Greg Rainmaker does not pour alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnaps important professors and heads a huge underworld empire. It's up to Goldson (Jewish action hero? Gevalt!) And his colorful sidekick crew to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and throwing away a lot of things. Perhaps "stabilization" has a different meaning in Indonesia. And violence, oh violence. This is a movie that is not willing, no, not able, to let five minutes of time on the screen go without any explosion, knives, car accidents, or squib to break the dialogue. Violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just really weird. For example, Stabilizer & Company attack one of the Rainmaker warehouses (by going through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). While sitting on the balcony, with a heavy fire from below, the Stabilizer does one thing he can do. He leaves the balcony in the head of a man, his front tire bouncing off him like a basketball. Stunning. Too Unholy Love Scenes (Both major female characters hop in a hero's bag of their choice not two minutes after talking to them for the first time) for a badly dubbed dialogue ("Victor, you talented bastard!") ") The stabilizer has it all. This is a movie for ages, right there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in the release. If you find it anywhere at any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
