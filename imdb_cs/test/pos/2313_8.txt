I cannot explain it, but I consider this film not only amusing, but so pleasant that I feel compelled to watch it again and again, or at least when I have cable television. I always felt it was a really bad movie, but maybe it's because I watched it on the cable. I plan to get a DVD from this movie to make a really honest look at, but more importantly, have a good time to watch it. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the movie and especially I liked the cast. I was always wondering if it liked doing the movies they were in, and that's no exception. This film deserved a better fate than he had accepted, and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who wouldn't? The characters in this movie were the kind of people I could identify with when I was in the army, and neglect was accurate. Nice soldiers.
