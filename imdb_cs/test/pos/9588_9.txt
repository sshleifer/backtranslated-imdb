Tweety is sent in his cage on the train by his owner. In the same luggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. At no time did Sylvester grab Tweety, but the trainer returned and killed the sleet of the cat calling him back to the cage. He puts Tweety "in a safer place," up high and tells the cat: "Now remember: no tricks!" Sylvester puts on his halo and looks innocent. Yeah, right. I found the funniest stuff, but didn't include Sylvester versus Tweety, but the "dog vision" that is in the other cage next to Sylvester. The cat roams with him and pays a great price in a fun way. Sylvester just didn't learn, but that's one of the reasons we love him! (I know many IMDb reviewers don't like Tweety, but I like both main characters - they both do me!) <br /> <br /> Also the train and the passing scenery are beautifully illustrated here - really nice visuals.
