What makes watching and viewing movies a pleasure is when once in a while you least expect it, a movie like The Cell comes and knocks your socks down! This movie is a great horror that has everything you want when you want to be frightened of your witnesses. Without going into the story, all I say is that it has a great start, center and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while being reworked with amazing special influences. Acting is good without being excellent, but it doesn't matter because the subject and the way it is shown on the big screen it's one of the best horror movies I've seen for a long time. It's one of those movies that you imagine starting as a novel, but it says credits don't seem like an adaptation, so a lot of credit must go to Mark Protosovich's writer. 9 of 10.
