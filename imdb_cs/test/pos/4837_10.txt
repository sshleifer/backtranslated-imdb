We will never see this film, which HBO will never see in the near future. If someone stumbles in the video store in some way, just grab it before someone else does it, because I doubt it ever releases. Incredible and up-to-date film about the World Trade Center first attack on 26 February 1993 and how it is the task of government agencies to identify and prevent terrorists from harming and harming US citizens he fell to work and unwittingly allowed him to become. Bone cooling, because we all know that the terrorists who were arrested at the end of the movie won't be over. from our nightmare, which resurrected September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The film brought everything that was wrong after 1992-93, allowing the first tragedy in the WTC. But it took another eight years to realize that we should learn from the first WTC attack to be more alert and ready to prevent the second and more destructive attack on the World Trade Center. I found this film harder to follow after the September 11 events then the 9/11 video attacks. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is that I don't look at it. The end is so powerful, just as prophetic, that he would leave you in a state of shock when you know what we know today, and perhaps in need of needing someone who is with you, but not watching a movie to call for medical care.
