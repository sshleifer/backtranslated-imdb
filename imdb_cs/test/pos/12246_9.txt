Movie viewers often say that great movies must have 3 unforgettable scenes to be considered truly great. Broadcast messages don't have <br /> <br /> three, it has twice. This movie is very well written by James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better <br /> <br />. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has some <br /> <br /> great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughs) "Can I <br /> <br /> sing and read, sing when I read," with Midnight Train <br Georgia plays in the background. # 2 (laughing) He said <br /> <br /> to William Hurt that "You really blew a nookie cover," <br /> <br /> after watching Hurt's data rape report. # 3 (Cried) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (Jay Brooks) finally tells Jayne that he loves her and she can't end up with Hurt's character because she represents <br all about journalism Jayne finds questionable. Finally, # 4 (laughs) that can forget the scene where Aaron <br /> <br /> hangs weekend news .... cheerful. This movie was to win an Oscar! He has everything I love in <br /> <br /> movies, great acting, smart scripts, and even Jack Nicholson <br /> <br /> portrait!
