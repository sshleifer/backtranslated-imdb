This film hits the heart with a reality I haven't seen. It shows what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and what we are lucky to experience. The film in the film is excellent, sometimes you have to remember that film is a dramatization and not a real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) to make investigators fully dimensional and human. Set is incredible. This gives a "round" feel to the theater, which does not add or take away from the emotion an action that seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and say that they have achieved that goal. .
