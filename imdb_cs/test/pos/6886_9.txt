I couldn't agree more with those who said it was a lousy movie. Me and my friend met him during the Stockholm Film Festival and it was actually one of my favorite films during the festival. Dolls used in horror movies are not something new, but I didn't see that many movies were just as well done as in this movie. Atmosphere, environment, actors, camera-work .. everything is just beautiful. And they really work together. Now that you expect this movie to be the next Grudge or Ring, you may not like it. But if your good, stylized fear, then it's perfect. Although it is quite predictable and sometimes it is ridiculous, I still recommend it to anyone who likes horror movements. Go see it. Now.
