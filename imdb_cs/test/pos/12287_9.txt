I do not want to spoil anyone, but it mimics the reality of life in so many ways, and if you are truly honest with yourself, you will resonate with it at least in several scenes. Br /> <br /> The action is not only believable but convincing in a way that radiates one of the characters. What's more, it's funny without trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And yes, I really believe the continuation is guaranteed. Look at the movie, you'll understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have a real message.
