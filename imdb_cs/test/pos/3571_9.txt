'Bluff' shows up for a few months in a movie theater in Bogota and I finally got to see it today. I didn't know what to expect, but I was very happily surprised. It is a criminal comedy of the same ilk as Snatch, etc. And it will manage to cope nicely with the tensions with the comedy. The film style is based on the beginnings of cheerful music and an Argentine narrator who is right on the camera - strange for the first time, but then naturally adapts to it. <br /> <br /> With my less than perfect Spanish, I still found the plot and the dialogue easy to follow, and lots of comedy is situational. My Colombian girlfriend laughed a lot at different views of people from different regions and social classes that went through me, but for example a well-functioning depiction of a pompous idiot in power is funny in any language. Br /> <br /> I think it is the credit of this film that it has something of a global character: I was not often reminded that it was Colombia I was watching. However, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos live as some of the characters in this film, and it is not a bad display of Bogota or Colombian society in any way, only * selective * images - like any film allegedly depicting "real" situation / culture. I don't know how much of a comedy would be lost in the headlines, but if it comes to your country, be sure to watch it: it's a very slippery and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humor. And all in tightly packed 90 minutes.
