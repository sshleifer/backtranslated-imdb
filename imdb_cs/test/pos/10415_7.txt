This image is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by Daniel Boon in the Cumberland Gap wilderness and at the same time threatened by hostile Indians. The treacherous Frenchman is causing all the problems between settlers and red men, while Boone is trying to convince Indians that pioneers just want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain attraction because it is not polished production, but there are good action scenes, though somewhat violent for their time. The cast consists of B actors, but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as Indian boss. Bruce Bennett is fine as Boone, but he's a little too clean and soft to be credible as a frontier man. The dialogue is somewhat banal, but the scenery fits with the realism of Kentucky.
