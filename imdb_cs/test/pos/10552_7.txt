This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance assuming a French style eclipse. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991, so the accountants in Hollywood naturally thought they could hire Depardieu and call the others. version, although in Depardieu he brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off. The point is, when the French make Lolita-lite, they get rid of it because they think "dirty French postcards" for their benefit; here the Hollywood concept of light subtlety is to have Depardieu (completely unaware that his daughter let it be known that he is actually her lover), prevailed on the play and song 'Something French', launching into a lively version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See original.
