I copied this video on DVD to enjoy it whenever I like it, and it's also a very successful (and rare) wedding gift! This is just an absolutely amazing adaptation of a very beloved novel. Everything on it is just perfect and has amazingly good aging. There is always a chance with something so old that it might seem a little wrinkled alongside more modern dramas, but 'Precious Bane' more than holds its own. The quality of the games is amazing with Janet McTeer making superlative Prudence and young Clive Owen stomping around like quiet Gideon Sarn. I urge no one to follow the last sequence without sniffing at the utter romance of it all. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you're snuggling on the couch. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend it.
