I didn't expect much from this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney perform great as the main characters in this film. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out who you really are, which is basically what this film is all about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets the retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express her thoughts in words. Slowly, but surely, he will pull himself out of his shell and become much less uncomfortable. Each viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theater is filled with laughter 75% of the time. The film meets all, and I hope that soon it can be released in all American theaters because many do not have a chance to see a film unless they live in big cities. It MUST MUST SEE!
