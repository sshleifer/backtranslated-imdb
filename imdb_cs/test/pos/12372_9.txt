Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" casts the viewer at a lower depth of life for most of his time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages include the mythical image of Death itself. Death is embodied here as a haunted horse-drawn carriage, fueled by a miserable sinner who died on New Year's Eve. For one year, the poor must collect the souls of the new departing, and after twelve months of this horrible slavery, the driver's own soul finally sets off when the last person who died on December 31 becomes a new driver. Scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as "Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in English speaking countries) are scary and fascinating, using double-exposure cinematography, which has been very sophisticated all the time and still effective, see today. Most noticeably, the carriage travels to the ocean floor to collect the soul of a person who has drowned. These scenes are equally fascinating, but most of the film concerns David Holm's downward spiral, which the director played in a subconscious image of a man who gave up the possibility of living a decent life. In the memories we see that Holm is enjoying a nice day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be an ordinary guy. Suddenly, without segue or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Usually this jump from Po-do might feel like a lack of storytelling, but in this case, the filmmakers believe that we will fill in intimate, sharp details on our own. It is suggested that Holm was led by astray by his friendly friend Georges, a drinking companion, which first refers to the story of Phantom Transportation, but whatever the cause of his fall Holm seems to be a lost thing, a slightly spirited drunk who takes a perverse. the pleasure of causing pain to his family and refusing reform. While David Holm is our central character, the real catalyst for the story is the young Salvation Army nurse who has a liking interest in his case and trusts in spite of his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself dies - indirectly because of her Holma leadership - she asks him to see him, and inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery. Times This film resembles Dickens' short story about Scrooge in his use of scary visitors who inspire a deeply defective man to inspect his life, suffering from his bad behavior and reform. She also reminded me of the 1917 Sjöström drama "Terje Vigen" in which a man returns from prison to find that his house is empty and his family is gone (there is a succession). The director also repeats the standard Scandinavian folklore theme found earlier in his "Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru" (a.k.a. "Outlaw and his wife," 1918) that no man can overtake his destiny. However, this time, it could be argued that David Holm will actually succeed in avoiding his seemingly inevitable fate, because he is given an unexpected second chance to change. Spectators who expect to delve into a supernatural world will appreciate the sequence featuring Phantom's title carriage, but may not be ready for this film's painful exploration of a troubled man's alcoholic fall. But those who want the intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate "Körkarlen" in its entirety. He stands with the best serious cinema of his time and is certainly one of Sjöström's most successful works.
