It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light humor of this year's best family movie ... Grand Champion. The story of a twelve-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, mom and best friends, is determined to lift the Grand Champion steer. It is a whimsical journey to a great competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned off for $ 775,000. pay for college education children. Buddy finds out the next time he sees Hokey ... it's gonna be a bun! Children conspire to steal the voter's winner, promising him to save him from the BBQ. This is where fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman, and so many other stars create the background for all the antics. You can't believe who actually won the auction !!! (Looks Good in Mustache) The soundtrack is rich in melodies from George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where else can you experience movie stars, Country & Western stars and Rodeo stars .... just in Texas ... only in the Grand Champion. It's a masterfully created "simple" little movie that can be the best movie you'll see this year. The film will open in selected cities on Friday, August 27th. 2004 <br /> <br /> Another great movie from Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WHISPER. Watch out for wired networks for this one!
