Like many other commentators, I went to expect the taste of music to satisfy my curiosity - and I got more than I wanted. I have heard and seen a powerful, beautiful, sometimes spooky, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the strict sense of the word) and an absolutely stunning mix of music and musicians. It reminded me of a lot of some forms of Indian music (East Indian), but it was also very different. Beginning with Baba Zula's first song to Kurdish singer Aynur (what voice) at Siyasiyabend on jam jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call it in India) in a small Turkish bar ft Selim Seslar (big fan Now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wished it didn't end. One of the best musical comments I've seen and heard over a long time. <br /> <br /> I long for a soundtrack CD and hope to see it soon online and also for old and new Baba Zula albums. A day later, music is still etched in my brain and I don't want it going away. Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, now appears to be such beautiful and exciting places - and I will start saving today to marry it. Akin's faith - it's a gem.
