Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with dark undertones. It is characterized by a children's story of desire and love with ecological consequences, but it is not a preaching. Hayao Miyazaki united Andersen's little mermaid with Japan's myths of Japan and his trademark of fantasy steam punk flights, and the result is very beneficial. There are some terrifying moments of ocean storms and floods, but they are exciting, not terrible. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to run with waves along the coast, ride jellyfish as a lift, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, Ponyo is the fable for you.
