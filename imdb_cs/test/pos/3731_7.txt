I saw it today with a little background about what to expect from the story. I'm going to the movies as an escape, leaving everything behind and enjoying the "story". I found it as a good movie, not a big one but a good one. Worth my money and my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was amazing, as always, Richard Gere is not an exaggerated actor. He kept his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. It brings its own style to the film. I think it was the kind of love story that isn't always said. It was chaotic and had different priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it!
