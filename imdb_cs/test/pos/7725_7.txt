This is a nice movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish film and certainly one of the greatest directors in Spanish film, but I don't think it's one of his biggest movies, even if it's fine. The script plays with Merimee as a character, it's a nice touch, but it's incredible. Music consists of Jose Nieto, National Spanish Cinema Award. I think this film is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I'll give it 7 out of 10 causes I think it might be a better movie, but as it is, it's not boring at all.
