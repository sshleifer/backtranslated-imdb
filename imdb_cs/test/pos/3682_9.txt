Men, I had doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought how good it could be, I never heard of this thing ...! You know, that was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we're gonna turn it off when it sucks" and we were shut down from get-go. This is a very entertaining, fun movie. It's weird, you know? I mean, you have a social singer, a murderer (and a credible), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates in all her acting beauty, Rupert Everett is finally working on her real potential, Dan Ackroyd and the dwarf you will laugh at. I'll tell you you'll laugh / you'll cry. I may have had a special week, but I think this film is at the level of fried green tomatoes. If you don't like the movie, you might not like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought a DVD.
