It's an excellent movie. No, it is not Mel Gibson in the "Brave Heart," but then it is not trying to be. Actually, "Emperor and Assassin" probably has (fortunately) more common with Shakespearean production than the Hollywood blockbuster. In the third century BC, King Qin attempts to unite (in other words "to conquer" seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Han kingdom. Now he needs an apology to invade the kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br This is where Lady Zhao comes in. She and the king have been friends since childhood, apparently very in love, but they can't marry for political reasons, they conspire together, and she pretends to fall into disaster with the king and escape to Yan Once there, he will persuade the Prince of Yan to send the murderer back to kill the king, and when the assassination fails, the king will have his apology to invade the Yana. When he hears and sees more and more examples of the recklessness of his childhood friend, he wondered whether the king might have to be murdered for a real final meeting of the king and the killer, unlike the Hollywood movie where the hero and the villain are clearly defined and the final result is already predestined, it is a struggle that could actually go in both directions. This is a well-prepared and well-functioning stormy story in Chinese history. There is a blend of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. But the most beautiful of all is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. Every time I see Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world, I'm more and more convinced. But I have to say that she has one unintentionally witty line in this movie. Soon Gong Li asks one of her servants "Am I having a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
