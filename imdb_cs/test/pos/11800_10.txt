Such an amazing movie - I've been transfixed all the time and finally overcome emotionally! The two young actors in the film were more than convincing in their performance because their friendship and mutual support was quite credible and I thought the comparison / contrast between their home lives vs. Of course, the success of bringing this film to life was a team effort of actors, EPs, producers, writers, directors, and the entire production I say: "WELL PLAYED!" After skipping credits at the beginning of the movie (it was shown on HBO) I was so surprised that I had to really (though briefly) research the internet to find the title of this movie - something so big It should be known - a clear indication that this movie must be reissued!
