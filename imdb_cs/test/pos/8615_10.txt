I was not surprised to read the director's comment that he made this film as an antidote to all the "productions" of the DVD show, as it certainly struck me. I admit that I have a penchant for "meta", but I thought this movie was very accessible and entertaining, even in a strenuous, confidently clever way, which is definitely something you expect in a movie. about filmmaking. It's very "French" in that there are a lot of weird, yet sometimes convincing theories about how filmmaking (and even sexuality) "works", but because the director doesn't play alone (instead of avatar), we have a lot of options ( because I am sure he is constantly opposed). Apparently Catherine Breillat specializes in films that cannot be seen, but I would say so. I really liked the dialogue, the balance between film and nature, the relationship between the director and her assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
