An impatiently silly anime, just six episodes of duration, about an unhappy boy named Kintaro (well, he is called a boy to be born even when he is 20 years old) and an adventure he has on his travels. Each episode sees his coming into a new city, gaining a new job, developing something of love interest before each episode ends with him leaving. Gently sexist, youthful, very immature at times, this is a kind of anime that just smiles on his face. No one starts if you're not an anime fan because it certainly won't convince the genre, but for those who are already transferred, it's a fun fluff.
