Besides being incredibly beautiful in the film, and all the prisoners in the camp being too fat, this film is true about the post-war chaos. Beautiful photo and powerful national photo expression of Polish national character. It is very slow in points, but its speed is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both major actors do a very good job. On the DVD version, you can see interviews with major actors and crews, and lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 pounds and has lost all her beauty. But in 1970 she was stunning.
