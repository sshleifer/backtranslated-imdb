I like this film because it has good access to Buddhism, for example, the way Buddhist uses all kinds of living things to care for, combining some fantasies and real situations; in some parts, the photo is very good and a lot of freedom reports, like a hawk episode, which is always concentrated at every moment, even in difficult situations. Her acting shows us how the people who live in this culture are trying to have resistance behavior when Miyagi takes her to a Buddhist temple and slowly changes her mind. And of course, Pat Morita was always great
