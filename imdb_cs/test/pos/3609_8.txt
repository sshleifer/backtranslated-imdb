Warning: If Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in the movie, read this review and keep going. Yes, I borrowed a "one-line summary" from President Ronald Reagan's book, but this film also highlights the role the character plays in the life of honest human beings. This film is full of honest, decent people and has integrity. In a word, they have a "character". Little Nitpick: If you don't know the history of WW II, you probably don't know, since Captain Correlli's arrival on the island for the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years ago. The average viewer may think that romance is a "faith" variety. That's not the case. Romance develops slowly, giving it dignity and importance. The film's intentional pace may be the director's way of marking time. Some reviews have criticized the Italian accent of Cage. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is pretty good. History was right on the mark. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who were mostly reluctant allies from the beginning. If you find that shocking, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, just after the surrender of France to not fall into the hands of Vichy's government, or worse Nazis. The depiction of Italians as educated and cultivated was a compliment of an educated and cultured civilization. The script was not provocative, nor was it clever, but here it was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, nor were they appropriate. The story is gentle and the message is uplifting. Characters are honest, brave, serious, compassionate and sympathetic. It's a nice little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
