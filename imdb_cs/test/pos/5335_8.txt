Based on the characters that were previously developed in a series of highly praised shorts, the PUBLIC RABBIT CURVE is about as far away from the normal "family fare" as you can get: a beautifully crafted and witty dialogue and clever concepts, this is a movie that will appeal to almost every family member. The story relates to Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a large-growing village for the annual trade fair and who operate "Anti-Pesto", a humane solution for all those nasty rabbits bothering passionate gardeners everywhere . Business is a great success - but Wallace turns out to be too smart for his own good. When she tries to "rehabilitate" rabbits from their green crispy ways, she unexpectedly unleashes the ancient horror of legendary proportions: Were-Rabbit! And suddenly there is no vegetable in the city! The film is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly clever dialogue and links to everything from KING KONG to WOLF MAN - more than enough to attract even a tired teenager - but the real magic of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality that artists and animators can tear from pieces of clay is amazing: they seem to be alive as any flesh and blood actor. The DVD release (and I recommend a wide screen) includes a range of informative and fun accessories as well. Very recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
