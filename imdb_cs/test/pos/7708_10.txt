This is one of the nine shorts on the anime disc, "The Animatrix." That's my favorite. Artwork is amazing. The black and white, somewhat grainy texture perfectly captures the mood that this segment is trying to render. The story is tight and the end is true film noir. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave The Animatrix "7" but this particular segment deserves "10."
