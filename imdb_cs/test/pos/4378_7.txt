I can't say I enjoyed it just like "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and I felt a little humiliated, but "O Brother" is a nice movie that deserves some good laughs and tastes of Coens' brisk movie. , a twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition includes featurette, and I was interested in finding out that Coens are quite simple in their overhead techniques. That surprised me! Of course, this film is not the best example (and I'm just comparing it) and it wasn't worthy of any Oscar (many people feel like it was robbed), but it may be an appeal. Although I enjoyed the previous work of Coens, I was never a fan of the old westerns, "The Dukes of Hazzard," or any of the things they show up on TNN daily. I think that's why I didn't feel so excited when I decided to watch this movie because I saw it revolving around Southern folk. For all those in the South who read it, I don't want to offend any of your people! I'm sure you feel the same when you watch urban areas like "Bronx Tale". When you live in a city all your life, it's hard to get used to movies of this kind. But all the apologies, I found the characters fun and unpredictable. I think John Turturro perfectly accented the accent, and when I saw her talking in real life, it's amazing. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - who I suppose is not the best in pretending accents, judging by his decision to drop the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing the New England accent for "The Perfect Storm" - naturally seems a little bad and constantly struggles with the accent. His performance was good. You can also see Coen regulators like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short time but steals every minute). Although I don't normally kick country music, I liked the title song "Man Constant Sorrow." The DVD also contains music video for this song. Overall, I found that the film is fun and original, but it doesn't have the quality of the face Coens has shown us in the past. It's easier, but good. I still recommend that you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
